    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nThe Company is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 2000. MGT was originally incorporated in Utah in 1977. MGT is comprised of the parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary MGT Sweden AB. MGT\u2019s corporate office is in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nCryptocurrency Mining Business\nIndustry Summary\nBitcoin is a world-recognized cryptocurrency, which can be traded and converted into major fiat currencies on cryptocurrency exchanges. Cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange that are transacted through and recorded on a decentralized distributed ledger system, called the \u201cBlockchain.\u201d The Blockchain is built by a chronological addition of transactions, which are grouped into blocks. Each new block requires a mathematical problem to be solved before it can be confirmed and added to the Blockchain. The processing power used to solve these mathematical problems is measured by Hash Rate or Hashes per second (\u201cH/s\u201d). The complexity of these problems, also referred to as mining difficulty, increases with the network\u2019s growing Hash Rate.\nBitcoin mining entails solving these complex mathematical problems using custom designed and programmed application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d) computers (also referred to as \u201cminers\u201d). Bitcoin miners perform a vital function on the Bitcoin Blockchain network, by performing these calculations and adding transaction blocks to the Blockchain ledger. When a miner is successful in adding a block to the Blockchain, it is rewarded with a fixed number of Bitcoin; a miner can also be compensated by network transaction fees.\nAdditional information about Bitcoin, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies can be found on publicly available educational sources such as www.Bitcoin.org.\nOur Operations\nCryptocurrency mining\nFollowing a review of its Bitcoin mining operations in early 2019, we determined to consolidate our activities in a Company-owned and managed facility. Central to this strategy was the purchase of land in LaFayette, GA and the entry into a favorable contract for electricity in the second quarter of 2019. Located adjacent to a utility substation, the several acre property has access to over 20 megawatts (MW) of low-cost power.\nThe Company owned approximately 669 and 649 Antminer S17 Pro Bitcoin miners located in LaFayette, GA as of December 31, 2020 and April 15, 2021, respectively. All miners were purchased from Bitmaintech Pte. Ltd., a Singapore limited company (\u201cBitmain\u201d), and are collectively rated at approximately 30 Ph/s in computing power. Bitmain has acknowledged manufacturing defects, combined with inadequate repair facilities, rendering approximately one half of our miners in need of repair or replacement. The Company\u2019s miners are housed in three modified shipping containers. The Company\u2019s current electrical load is estimated at under 1.0 MW. The entire facility, including the land, two 2500 KVA 3-phase transformers, the mining containers, and miners, are owned by MGT. As the Company is presently using only a portion of the built-out available electrical load, it is exploring ways to grow and maintain its current operations including but not limited to further equipment sales, leasing space to other Bitcoin miners, and raising capital to acquire newest generation miners.\nPrior to establishing our Company-owned and managed facility, we conducted our Bitcoin mining operations through third-party hosting arrangements. We also entered into management agreements with third party investors whereby the investors purchased the mining hardware, and we received both a fee to manage the mining operations plus one-half of the net operating profit. In March 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement to terminate our hosting agreement in Washington and conveyed ownership of its onsite mining assets for full satisfaction of $77 in outstanding hosting service fees. In August and September 2019, we terminated all our management agreements with third party investors, and in December 2019, we terminated our final remaining hosting arrangements in Colorado and Ohio.\nBitcoin And Blockchain Overview\nA Bitcoin is one type of a digital asset that is issued by, and transmitted through, an open source, math-based protocol platform using cryptographic security (the \u201cBitcoin Network\u201d). The Bitcoin Network is an online, peer-to-peer user network that hosts the public Blockchain transaction ledger and the source code that comprises the basis for the cryptography and math-based protocols governing the Bitcoin Network. No single entity owns or operates the Bitcoin Network, the infrastructure of which is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base. Bitcoin can be used to pay for goods and services or can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar, at rates determined on Bitcoin exchanges or in individual peer to peer end-user-to-end-user transactions.\nBitcoins are \u201cstored\u201d or reflected on the Blockchain in a decentralized manner on the computers of each Bitcoin Network user. The Blockchain records the transaction history of all Bitcoin in existence and, through the transparent reporting of transactions, allows the Bitcoin Network to verify the association of each Bitcoin with the digital wallet that owns it. The Bitcoin Network and Bitcoin software programs can interpret the Blockchain to determine the exact Bitcoin balance, if any, of any digital wallet listed in the Blockchain as having taken part in a transaction on the Bitcoin Network.\nThe Bitcoin Network, being decentralized, does not rely on either governmental authorities or financial institutions to create, transmit or determine the value of Bitcoin. Rather, Bitcoin are created and allocated by the Bitcoin Network protocol through a \u201cmining\u201d process subject to a strict, well-known issuance schedule. The value of Bitcoin is determined by the supply and demand of Bitcoin in the Bitcoin exchange market (and in private peer to peer transactions), as well as the number of merchants that accept it. As Bitcoin transactions can be broadcast to the Bitcoin Network by any user\u2019s Bitcoin software and Bitcoin can be transferred without the involvement of intermediaries or third parties, there are only minor transaction costs in direct peer-to-peer transactions on the Bitcoin Network. Third party service providers such as Bitcoin exchanges and third party payment processing services may charge significant fees for processing transactions and for converting, or facilitating the conversion of, Bitcoin to or from fiat currency.\nMiners dedicate substantial resources to mining. Given the increasing difficulty of the target established by the Bitcoin Network, miners must continually invest in expensive mining hardware to achieve adequate processing power to hash at a competitive rate.\nBitcoin is an example of a digital asset that is not a fiat currency (i.e., a currency that is backed by a central bank or a national, supra-national or quasi-national organization) and are not backed by hard assets or other credit. As a result, the value of Bitcoin is determined by the value that various market participants place on Bitcoin through their transactions.\nThe supply of Bitcoin is finite. Once 21 million Bitcoin are generated, the network will stop producing more. Currently, there are approximately 19 million Bitcoin in circulation, or 90% of the total supply of Bitcoin. Within the Bitcoin protocol is an event referred to as Bitcoin halving (\u201cHalving\u201d) where the Bitcoin provided upon mining a block is reduced by 50%. Halvings are scheduled to occur once every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, until the maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin is reached. The most recent Halving occurred in May 2020, with a revised reward payout of 6.25 Bitcoin per block.\nGiven a stable hash rate, a Halving reduces the number of new Bitcoin being generated by the network. While the effect is to limit the supply of new coins, it has no impact on the quantity of total Bitcoin outstanding. As a result, the price of Bitcoin could rise or fall based on overall investor and consumer demand. Should the price of Bitcoin remain unchanged after the next Halving, the Company\u2019s revenue would be reduced by 50%, with a much larger negative impact to profit.\nThe cryptocurrency markets have grown rapidly in both popularity and market size. These markets are local, national and international and include an ever-broadening range of products and participants. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), and other governmental agencies around the world, are evaluating the cryptocurrency markets and are likely to institute new rules and regulations within this market to protect investors and such regulations could result in the restriction of the acquisition, ownership, holding, selling, use or trading of our common stock.\nStrategy\nMGT\u2019s strategy is to oversee the operation of its Bitcoin miners in La Fayette, Georgia. The Company\u2019s immediate focus is to grow free cash flow, with a longer-term objective to expand its mining operation.\nCompetition\nOur industry is extremely new and subject to rapid change and constant innovation. We face significant competition, including from companies that have entered this space much earlier than us and are better capitalized, with vertically integrated business models. Some of these companies are our suppliers. We compete to attract, engage, and retain personnel, educated and skilled in the Blockchain and cryptocurrency mining space.\nWe compete with vertically integrated companies such as Bitfury Group Limited and Bitmain Technologies LTD that engage in both the design and distribution of mining machines, as well as cryptocurrency mining. We also compete with many other companies that are engaged in cryptocurrency mining, some of which may have lower operating costs or cost of capital than MGT.\nEmployees\nCurrently, the Company and its subsidiary have 2 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union and we believe our relationships with our employees are good.\nAvailable Information\nMGT maintains a website at www.mgtci.com.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nFollowing a review of its Bitcoin mining operations in early 2019, we determined to consolidate our activities in a Company-owned and managed facility.

Located adjacent to a utility substation, the several acre property has access to over 20 megawatts (MW) of low-cost power.\nThe Company owned approximately 669 and 649 Antminer S17 Pro Bitcoin miners located in LaFayette, GA as of December 31, 2020 and April 15, 2021, respectively. All miners were purchased from Bitmaintech Pte. Ltd., a Singapore limited company (\u201cBitmain\u201d), and are collectively rated at approximately 30 Ph/s in computing power. Bitmain has acknowledged manufacturing defects, combined with inadequate repair facilities, rendering approximately one half of our miners in need of repair or replacement. The Company\u2019s miners are housed in three modified shipping containers. The Company\u2019s current electrical load is estimated at under 1.0 MW.

In August and September 2019, we terminated all our management agreements with third party investors, and in December 2019, we terminated our final remaining hosting arrangements in Colorado and Ohio.\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nWe believe the critical accounting policies listed below reflect significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue recognition\nOur primary revenue stream is related to the mining of digital currencies. We derive our revenue by solving \u201cblocks\u201d to be added to the blockchain and providing transaction verification services within the digital currency network of Bitcoin, commonly termed \u201ccryptocurrency mining.\u201d In consideration for these services, we receive digital currency (\u201cCoins\u201d). The Coins are recorded as revenue, using the average spot price of Bitcoin on the date of receipt. The Coins are recorded on the balance sheet as an intangible digital asset valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value adjustments, to adjust the value of Coins to market value, is included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statement of operations. Further, any gain or loss on the sale of Coins would be recorded to costs of revenue. Costs of revenue include hosting fees, equipment and infrastructure depreciation, net realizable value adjustments, and electricity costs.\nWe also recognized revenue from our management agreements through their termination in August and September 2019. We received a fee from each management agreement based on the amount of Bitcoin mined, half of profits and were reimbursed for any electricity costs incurred to run the Bitcoin mining machines they managed in their facilities. Additionally, we had machines located in hosted facilities in Ohio and Colorado. We received an allocation of profits from these facilities. We terminated both hosting arrangements in December 2019.\nWe also recognize a royalty participation upon the sale of modified shipping containers manufactured by Bit5ive LLC of Miami, Florida under the terms of a collaboration agreement entered in August 2018.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method on the various asset classes over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to ten years when placed in service. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. Deposits on property and equipment are initially classified as Other Assets and upon delivery, installation and full payment, the assets are classified as property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet.\nStock-based compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for all equity-based payments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 718 \u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation\u201d. Under fair value recognition provisions, the Company recognizes equity-based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award.\nRestricted stock awards are granted at the discretion of the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company (the \u201cBoard\u201d). These awards are restricted as to the transfer of ownership and generally vest over the requisite service periods, typically over a 12 to 24 month period (vesting on a straight-line basis). The fair value of a stock award is equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company\u2019s Common Stock on the grant date.\nThe fair value of an option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model requires the development of assumptions that are inputs into the model. These assumptions are the expected stock volatility, the risk-free interest rate, the expected life of the option, the dividend yield on the underlying stock and the expected forfeiture rate. Expected volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock over the expected term of the option. Risk-free interest rates are calculated based on continuously compounded risk-free rates for the appropriate term.\nDetermining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of equity-based payment awards requires the input of the subjective assumptions described above. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of equity-based payment awards represent management\u2019s best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u2019s judgment. We are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest.\nWe account for share-based payments granted to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, \u201cEquity Based Payments to Non-Employees\u201d. We determine the fair value of the stock-based payment as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more readily determinable. If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty\u2019s performance is complete.\nEquity-linked instruments\nThe Company accounts for equity-linked instruments with certain anti-dilution provisions in accordance with ASC 815 and ASC 260. Under this guidance, the Company excludes instruments with certain down round features when determining whether a financial instrument (or embedded conversion feature) is considered indexed to the Company\u2019s own stock. As a result, financial instruments (or embedded conversion features) with down round features are not required to be classified as derivative liabilities. The Company recognizes the value of a down round feature only when it is triggered and the exercise or conversion price has been adjusted downward. For equity-classified freestanding financial instruments, such as warrants, the Company treats the value of the effect of the down round, when triggered, as a deemed dividend and a reduction of income available to common stockholders in computing basic earnings per share. For convertible instruments with embedded conversion features containing down round provisions, the Company recognizes the value of the down round as a beneficial conversion discount to be amortized to earnings.\nAny incentive-based compensation received by the Optionee from the Company hereunder or otherwise shall be subject to recovery by the Company in the circumstances and manner provided in any Incentive-based Compensation Recovery that may be adopted or implemented by the Company and in effect from time to time on or after the date hereof, and Optionee shall effectuate any such recovery at such time and in such manner as the Company may specify.\nDerivative Instruments\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value in accordance with ASC 815. When the Company enters into a financial instrument such as a debt or equity agreement (the \u201chost contract\u201d), the Company assesses whether the economic characteristics of any embedded features are clearly and closely related to the primary economic characteristics of the remainder of the host contract. When it is determined that (i) an embedded feature possesses economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the primary economic characteristics of the host contract, and (ii) a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a financial derivative instrument, then the embedded feature is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative instrument. The estimated fair value of the derivative feature is recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets separately from the carrying value of the host contract. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of derivatives are recorded as a gain or loss in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.\nImpairment\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever facts or circumstances either internally or externally may suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, Should there be an indication of impairment, we test for recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset or asset group. Any excess of the carrying value of the asset or asset group over its estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nNote 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report includes Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\nResults of operations\nYears ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenues\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $990, or 220%, to $1,440 as compared to $450 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our revenue is primarily derived from cryptocurrency mining which totaled $1,434 during 2020. The increase in revenues is a result of increased Bitcoin mining production and Bitcoin prices.\nThe Company is also entitled to a royalty from the sale of POD5 mining containers manufactured and sold by Bit5ive, LLC. During 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $4 and $44, respectively, in royalties under this agreement due to a lower number of POD5 sales.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $3,640, or 46%, to $4,311 as compared to $7,951 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in operating expenses was comprised of lower general and administrative expenses of $4,857, offset by an increase in cost of revenue of $1,218.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $1,218, or 239%, to $1,728 as compared to $510 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The primary reasons for this increase included higher electricity usage of $560 from increased bitcoin mining, and higher depreciation expense of $932 resulting from recognition of a full year of service our bitcoin mining machines and related assets; these assets were placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2019, and were depreciated for just one quarter in 2019. These increases were offset by approximately $276 relating to other costs of revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses of $4,857 or 65% to $2,584 as compared to $7,441 for the year ended December 31, 2019, was primarily caused by a decrease in stock-based compensation of $2,078 based on fewer shares issued or vested and a lower stock price in 2020 compared to 2019, a decrease in payroll and related expenses of $436, a decrease of consulting fees in the amount of $643, and a decrease in legal and professional fees of $208. These decreases were partly offset by an increase related to the Company\u2019s mining facility of $104.\nOther Income and Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, non-operating expense consisted of accretion of debt discount of $882, a loss on sale of property and equipment of $352, and interest expense of $347, partially offset by the change in fair value of the liability associated with the termination of management agreements of $26, the change in fair value of derivative liability of $309, funding from PPP Loan of $111, and other income of $119.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, non-operating expense consisted of accretion of debt discount of $5,605, partially offset by a gain on extinguishment of debt of $3,540, interest income of $10, a gain on sale of property and equipment of $599, and a change in the fair value of the liability associated with the termination of the management agreements of $176.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have historically financed our business through the sale of debt and equity interests. We have incurred significant operating losses since inception and continue to generate losses from operations and as of December 31, 2020 have an accumulated deficit of $418,389. At December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents were $236, and our working capital deficit was $1,527. As of December 31, 2020, we had one note payable outstanding with a principal amount of $230.\nIn January 2020, management completed the initial phase of its plan to consolidate its activities in Company-owned and managed facilities, executing on its expansion model to secure low cost power and grow its cryptocurrency assets. In connection with this plan, the Company terminated its management agreements and its third-party hosting arrangements in 2019. The Company will need to raise additional funding to grow its operations and to pay current maturities of debt. There can be no assurance however that the Company will be able to raise additional capital when needed, or at terms deemed acceptable, if at all. Such factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to sustain operations for at least one year from the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe price of Bitcoin is volatile, and fluctuations are expected. Declines in the price of Bitcoin have had a negative impact in our operating results and liquidity and could harm the price of our Common Stock. Movements may be influenced by various factors, including, but not limited to, government regulation, security breaches experienced by service providers, as well as political and economic uncertainties around the world. Since we record revenue based on the price of earned Bitcoin and we may retain such Bitcoin as an asset or as payment for future expenses, the relative value of such revenues may fluctuate, as will the value of any Bitcoin we retain. The high and low exchange rate per Bitcoin for the year ending December 31, 2020, as reported by Blockchain.info, were approximately $5 and $29 respectively.\nThe supply of Bitcoin is finite. Once 21 million Bitcoin are generated, the network will stop producing more. Currently, there are approximately 19 million Bitcoin in circulation, or 90% of the total supply of Bitcoin. Within the Bitcoin protocol is an event referred to as Halving where the Bitcoin reward provided upon mining a block is reduced by 50%. Halvings are scheduled to occur once every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, until the maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin is reached. The most recent Halving occurred in May 2020, with a revised reward payout of 6.25 Bitcoin per block.\nGiven a stable hash rate, a Halving reduces the number of new Bitcoin being generated by the network. While the effect is to limit the supply of new coins, it has no impact on the quantity of total Bitcoin outstanding. As a result, the price of Bitcoin could rise or fall based on overall investor and consumer demand. Should the price of Bitcoin remain unchanged after the next Halving, the Company\u2019s revenue would be reduced by 50%, with a much larger negative impact to profit.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic represents a fluid situation that presents a wide range of potential impacts of varying durations for different global geographies, including locations where we have offices, employees, customers, vendors and other suppliers and business partners. Like most US-based businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate the same began to have impacts on our business in March 2020. By that time, much of our first fiscal quarter was completed. In light of broader macro-economic risks and already known impacts on certain industries, we have taken, and continue to take targeted steps to lower our operating expenses because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations closely and this situation could change based on a significant number of factors that are not entirely within our control and are discussed in this and other sections of this annual report on Form 10-K. To date, travel restrictions and border closures have not materially impacted our ability to operate. However, if such restrictions become more severe, they could negatively impact those activities in a way that would harm our business over the long term. Travel restrictions impacting people can restrain our ability to operate, but at present we do not expect these restrictions on personal travel to be material to our business operations or financial results. Like most companies, we have taken a range of actions with respect to how we operate to assure we comply with government restrictions and guidelines as well as best practices to protect the health and well-being of our employees. We have also undertaken measures to reduce our administrative and advisory costs required as a publicly reporting company. Actions taken to date include salary reductions for senior management and termination of certain consulting agreements. However, the impacts of COVID-19 and efforts to mitigate the same have remained unpredictable and it remains possible that challenges may arise in the future.\nOur primary source of operating funds has been through debt and equity financing.\nEquity Purchase Agreements\nIn June 2019, we entered into an equity purchase agreement pursuant to which we could issue and sell to an investor from time to time up to 76,558,643 shares of our common stock registered with the SEC under a Form S-1. Through October 2019, 52,000,000 shares were issued and sold under this registration statement for net proceeds of $1,654.\nSale of Preferred Stock\nOn April 12, 2019, our Board of Directors approved the authorization of 200 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.001 and a stated value of $10,000 per share (\u201cPreferred Shares\u201d). The holders of the Preferred Shares are not entitled to voting rights or to receive dividends. At any time prior to the one-year anniversary from the issuance date, the Company may redeem the Preferred Shares at 1.4 times the Stated Value, following which we may redeem the Preferred Shares at 1.2 times the Stated Value.\nEach Preferred Share is convertible into shares of our common stock in an amount equal to the greater of: (a) 200,000 shares of common stock or (b) the amount derived by dividing the Stated Value by the product of 0.7 times the market price of our common stock, defined as the lowest trading price of our common stock during the ten day period preceding the conversion date. The holder may not convert any Preferred Shares if the total amount of shares, together with holdings of its affiliates, following a conversion shall exceed 9.99% of our common stock. The common shares issued upon conversion have been registered under our registration statement on Form S-3. On April 12, 2019 and July 15, 2019, we sold 190 Preferred Shares for $1,890 and 10 Preferred Shares for $100, respectively.\nSale of Common Stock\nOn April 12, 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement with an accredited investor whereby we sold 17,500,000 shares of our common stock for $525 pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3. The holder of these shares is also the holder of an unsecured promissory note in the amount of $3,600 (the \u201cJune 2018 Note\u201d) and an affiliate of the acquirer of 160 shares of the Preferred Shares of which 115 are issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nOn January 28, 2021 and February 18, 2021, we issued 2,597,403 and 27,272,727 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, respectively, to Chicago Venture Partners L.P., a Utah limited partnership, and Uptown Capital LLC, a Utah limited liability company, in connection with the conversion of 10 and 105 shares of the Company\u2019s Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries C Preferred\u201d). Following these conversions, the Company has no Series C Preferred issued or outstanding.\nDebt Financing\nDecember 2020 Note\nOn December 8, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $230 which is convertible, at the option of the holder, into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to 70% of the lowest price for a share of common stock during the ten trading days immediately preceding the applicable conversion. The Company received consideration of $200 for the convertible promissory note. The note bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum and matures in twelve months.\nOn March 5, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the \u201cSecurities Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Bucktown Capital, LLC (the \u201cInvestor\u201d), pursuant to which the Company issued a convertible promissory note in the original principal amount of $13,210 (the \u201c2021 Note\u201d). The 2021 Note is convertible, at the option of the Investor, into shares of common stock of the Company at a conversion price equal to 70% of the lowest price for a share of common stock during the ten trading days immediately preceding the applicable conversion (the \u201cConversion Price\u201d); provided, however, in no event shall the Conversion Price be less than $0.04 per share. The 2021 Note bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum and will mature in twelve months.\nThe 2021 Note will be funded in tranches, with the initial tranche of $1,210 funded by the Investor on March 5, 2021 for consideration of $1,000. Six subsequent tranches (five tranches, each for $1,200 and one tranche for $6,000) will be funded upon the notice of effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form S-1 covering the common stock issuable in connection with the 2021 Note. Further, the final tranche requires the mutual agreement of the Company and Investor. Until such time as Investor has funded the subsequent tranches, the Company will hold a series of Investor Notes that offset any unfunded portion of the 2021 Note.\nThe PPP Loan\nOn April 16, 2020, we entered into a promissory note with Aquesta Bank for $111 in connection with the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) offered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d). The PPP Loan bears interest at 1% per annum, with monthly installments of $6 commencing on November 1, 2021 for 18 months through its maturity on April 1, 2023. The principal amount of the PPP Loan will be forgiven if the loan proceeds are used to pay for payroll costs, rent and utilities costs over the 24-week period after the PPP Loan is made. Not more than 40% of the forgiven amount may be used for non-payroll costs. The amount of the loan forgiveness may be reduced if the Company reduces its full-time head count. On April 1, 2021, the Company received notice of forgiveness in the amount of $108 in relation to the PPP Loan. The Company used all proceeds from the PPP Loan to maintain payroll and other allowable expenses. As a result, management believes that the Company has met the PPP eligibility criteria for forgiveness for the remaining payable of $3 to the SBA and has concluded that the loan represents, in substance, a government grant that is expected to be forgiven in its entirety.\nProperty & Equipment Acquisitions and Commitments\nIn connection with consolidating our activities in a Company-owned and managed facility in LaFayette, Georgia, we acquired the following assets during 2019 and 2020:\n\u25cf 6 acres of land in Lafayette, Georgia for $55\n\u25cf 1,500 Bitcoin miners valued at $2,313\n\u25cf Infrastructure costs totaling $905, including transformers and related equipment, land preparation, fencing, electrical contracting, permits, design and architectural fees\n\u25cf 5 modified Bitcoin mining containers for $761\nPhase I of the LaFayette site is structurally complete.

The audit committee focuses on assessing and mitigating financial risk, including risk related to internal controls, and receives at least quarterly reports from management on identified risk areas. In setting compensation, the compensation committee strives to create incentives that encourage behavior consistent with the Company\u2019s business strategy, without encouraging undue risk-taking.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) regarding the Company and its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Words such as \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates\", \"could\", \"may\", \"should\", \"will\", \"would\", and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended to identify forward-looking statements in this report. Additionally, statements concerning future matters such as the development of new services, technology enhancements, purchase of equipment, credit arrangements, possible changes in legislation and other statements regarding matters that are not historical are forward-looking statements.\nAlthough forward-looking statements in this Annual Report reflect the good faith judgment of the Company's management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by the Company. Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, contingencies and uncertainties, and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from results and outcomes discussed in this report. Although the Company believes that its plans, intentions and expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company can give no assurance that its plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. For a more complete discussion of these risk factors, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\u201d\nFor example, the Company's ability to maintain a positive cash flow and to become profitable may be adversely affected as a result of a number of factors that could thwart its efforts. These factors include the Company's inability to successfully implement the Company's business and revenue model, higher costs than anticipated, the Company's inability to sell its products and services to a sufficient number of customers, the introduction of competing products or services by others, the Company's failure to attract sufficient interest in, and traffic to, its sites, the Company's inability to complete development of its products, the failure of the Company's operating systems, and the Company's inability to increase its revenues as rapidly as anticipated.\nOverview\nShipTime Inc. has developed a SaaS based application, which focuses on the small to medium business segment.

This capability also provides cost advantages, rapid response to market needs, simplified processes for boarding business and a seamless interface for our merchant customers.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. However, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, our management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Those estimates and judgments are based upon our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information that we obtain from our customers and outside sources, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting policies include:\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenue principally from the sales related to the label generation services, shipping calculator services, brewery management software subscriptions, merchant processing services, and client services.\nThe Company recognizes revenues in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 606. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenues when the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nFor label generation service revenues the Company recognizes revenue when a customer has successfully prepared a shipping label and had a pickup. The service is offered to consumers via an online registration and allows users to create a shipping label using a credit card on their account (all customers must have a valid credit card on file to process shipments on the ShipTime platform).\nFor shipping calculator revenues and brewery management software and other subscription-based revenues, the Company recognizes subscription revenue on a monthly basis. Shipping calculator customers\u2019 renewal dates are based on their date of installation and registration of the shipping calculator line of products. The timing of the revenue recognition and cash collection may vary within a given quarter and the deposits for future services are recorded as contract liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Brewery management software subscribers are billed monthly at the first of the month. All payments are made via credit card for the month following.\nFor payment processing services, the Company recognizes revenue based on daily transactions by our partners and merchants. Customers process credit card payments for sales and remit fees based on the number of transactions and percent of the processed amounts. The merchant bank deposits the funds to the customer net of fees. The remainder of the fees withheld is disbursed to the Company on a daily basis, net of interchange and other transactional charges.\nForeign Currency\nThe currencies of ShipTime, the Company\u2019s international subsidiary, are in Canadian dollars. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2020. Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders\u2019 equity in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews the carrying values of its long-lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the expected future cash flow from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized and measured using the fair value of the related asset. There can be no assurance, however, that market conditions will not change or demand for the Company\u2019s services will continue, which could result in additional impairment of long-lived assets in the future.\nShare- Based Compensation\nThe Board of Directors has on occasion voted to award stock options or common shares/preferred shares to employees or directors. The price at which the option shares may be purchased is based on the fair market value of the shares on the date of the agreement. Each recipient\u2019s option agreement may differ; the vesting terms may vary from fully vested immediately to one-third immediately, one-third vesting in 18 months and the final one-third vesting in 36 months from the date of the grant or one-third immediately, one-third vesting on January 1, 2019 and one-third vesting on January 1, 2020. Historically the options granted have had a 10-year term. If the recipient\u2019s employment or relationship with the Company is terminated the options recipient may be allowed up to three months to exercise their options. Option compensation is calculated by using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share-based awards.\nLeases\nA right-of-use asset represents a lessee\u2019s right to use a leased asset for the term of the lease. Our right-of-use assets generally consist of an operating lease for a building. Right-of-use assets are measured initially at the present value of the lease payments, plus any lease payments made before a lease began and any initial direct costs, such as commissions paid to obtain a lease. Right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, adjusted for incentives, prepaid or accrued rent, and any initial direct costs not yet expensed.\nWe have an operating lease for our corporate offices in Canada and finance leases for furniture and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of six months to thirty-two months, and our primary operating leases include options to extend the leases for four years. Future renewal options that are not likely to be executed as of the balance sheet date are excluded from right-of-use assets and related lease liabilities.\nWe report operating leased assets, as well as operating lease current and noncurrent obligations on our balance sheets for the right to use the building in our business. Our finance leases represent furniture and office equipment; we report the furniture and equipment, as well as finance lease current and noncurrent obligations on our balance sheet.\nGenerally, interest rates are stated in our leases for equipment. When no interest rate is stated in a lease, however, we review the interest rates implicit in our recent finance leases to estimate our incremental borrowing rate. We determine the rate implicit in a lease by using the most recent finance lease rate, or other method we think most closely represents our incremental borrowing rate.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and\nThe following discussion compares the Company's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 with those for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion.\nRevenues\nThe following table compares total revenue for the periods indicated.\nYears ended December 31,\n% Change\nClient services\n$3,541\n$19,395\n(82)%\nShipping calculator services\n27,845\n148,035\n(81)%\nBrewery management software\n114,881\n193,150\n(41)%\nMerchant processing services\n425,839\n2,011\n21,071%\nShipping coordination and label generation services\n12,348,683\n10,185,704\n21%\nTotal revenues\n$12,920,789\n$10,548,295\n22%\nRevenues increased 22% in 2020 primarily from the continued growth of the shipping coordination and label generation services and the addition of merchant processing services to the Company\u2019s revenue stream.\nClient services revenues decreased $15,854 or 82% to $3,541 compared to $19,395 in 2019. The decrease was attributable to depleting inventory of our movie posters available for auction.\nShipping calculator services revenues decreased $120,190 or 81% to $27,845 compared to $148,035 in 2019. The decrease was attributed to discontinuance of billable services for a portion of the AuctionInc products. The Company is preparing to launch a new platform where the new clients will be migrated to.\nBrewery management software revenues decreased $78,269 or 41% to $114,881 in 2020 compared to $193,150 in 2019. The decrease is attributable to the additional competition in the brewery management software industry and the limited marketing to new clients.\nMerchant processing services is a new segment for the Company launched in late 2019. This segment has contributed to the overall growth of the Company increasing $423,828 to $425,839 in 2020 from $2,011 in 2019. These services also have a higher gross margin and gross profit. They will continue to be a source of growth for the Company.\nShipping coordination and label generation service revenues increased $2,162,979 or 21% to $12,348,683 in 2020 compared to $10,185,704 in 2019.

BUSINESS\nSolely for convenience, trademarks and tradenames referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K appear (after the first usage) without the \u00ae and \u2122 symbols, but those references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or that the applicable owner will not assert its rights, to these trademarks and tradenames.\nOverview\nBIO-key International, Inc. (the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cBIO-key,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a leading identity and access management (IAM) platform provider enabling secure work-from-anywhere for enterprise, education, and government customers. Our vision is to enable any organization to secure streamlined and passwordless workforce, customer, citizen and student access to any online service, workstation, or mobile application, without a requirement to use tokens or phones. Our products include PortalGuard\u00ae and PortalGuard Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) enterprise IAM, WEB-key\u00ae biometric civil and large-scale ID infrastructure, and high-quality, low-cost accessory hardware to provide a full and complete solution for identity-innovating customers.\nBIO-key PortalGuard empowers organizations to maximize the power of cloud, mobile and web technologies by securing users\u2019 identities and connecting them with the applications they rely on, while keeping cyber-intruders and unauthorized delegates (proxy) out.\nMillions of users trust BIO-key\u00ae to secure access to a variety of cloud, mobile and web applications, on-premise and cloud-based hypervisor servers from all of their devices. Employees and contractors sign into BIO-key PortalGuard to seamlessly and securely access the applications of need to do their work, and customers sign into BIO-key PortalGuard to access online services. Organizations use PortalGuard to securely collaborate and communicate with their partners and to provide their customers with flexible, resilient user experiences online and while using mobile devices.\nBIO-key\u2019s WEB-key is a scalable biometric service management platform, incorporating key functions for regulatory compliance, enrollment, authentication or identification, and integrity in a multi-tenant private or public cloud delivery platform. Government agencies use BIO-key for their large-scale civil ID projects, because WEB-key underpins a biometric identity ecosystem, is cloud-ready, and provides a scalable, high-integrity trust platform which can be operated anywhere and supports over 30 fingerprint scanners interchangeably.\nWe also deliver biometric software integration application programming interfaces, or APIs, allowing software developers to leverage our platform to securely and efficiently embed biometric multi-factor authentication, or MFA, into their own products. This allows software developers to focus on their core functionality while BIO-key ensures users enter the application without requiring they carry their phone or any token.\nEven the most security-focused organizations are suffering breaches as a result of human error or improper conduct. As enterprises scale the number of software as a service, or SaaS applications, and multi-cloud services they rely on and the interconnections between them increase, assured identity has emerged as a critical component of an organization\u2019s security framework, directly affecting each triad of cybersecurity - confidentiality, integrity, and availability. As access perimeters dissolve, organizations must evolve from network-based security models to Zero Trust and Continuous Authentication and Risk Trust Assessment (CARTA) security models, focusing on adaptive and context-aware controls. True server-secured biometric verification removes the human nature vulnerability at the root of many security compromises creating a more reliable means to manage user access and protect digital assets against rogue users willing to hand over their credentials to a proxy. Our global identity as a service, or IDaaS, hosting capability allows our customers to simplify and efficiently scale their security infrastructures across internal IT systems and external customer facing applications without installation overhead, security or uptime management efforts.\nWe designed BIO-key PortalGuard IDaaS and WEB-key to provide organizations an integrated approach to managing and securing all of their identities using the technologies they already use while providing capacity for future needs through the strategic use of biometrics to limit vulnerability and contain authentication costs. Our platform allows users to authenticate their customers, employees, contractors, and partners. It enables any user to connect to any device, cloud or application, all with a simple, customizable, intuitive and consumer-friendly user experience. We utilize server-secured biometrics to support roving users without requiring them to carry their phone or a token. As of December 31, 2020, more than 300 customers across multiple industries use BIO-key to secure and manage access for users around the world.\nDevelopment of Business\nWe were founded in 1993 to develop and market advanced fingerprint biometric technology and related security software solutions. First incorporated as BBG Engineering, the company was renamed SAC Technologies in 1994 and renamed BIO-key International, Inc. in 2002. Our principal executive office is located at 3349 Highway 138, Building A, Suite E, Wall, New Jersey 07719.\nWe were pioneers in developing automated, finger identification technology that supplements or compliments other methods of identification and verification, such as personal inspection identification, passwords, tokens, smart cards, ID cards, credit card, passports, driver\u2019s licenses, or other form of possession or knowledge-based credentialing. Our advanced technology has been, and is, used to improve both the accuracy and speed of competing fingerprint biometrics in some of the largest biometric systems in the world.\nOn June 30, 2020, we enhanced our product offering by acquiring PistolStar, Inc. (\u201cPistolStar\u201d) for $2.5 million. PistolStar provides enterprise-ready identity access management solutions to commercial, government and education customers throughout the United States and internationally. PistolStar develops and markets our PortalGuard line of software and services.\nOur Products\nBIO-key PortalGuard and PortalGuard IDaaS\nBIO-key PortalGuard is an independent, customer-controlled and neutral-by-design cloud-based identity platform that allows our customers to integrate with any cloud or on-premise SaaS application, service or cloud host, as well as Windows device authentication through a single secure, reliable and scalable IAM platform. It provides identical capabilities in both a SaaS (PortalGuard IDaaS) or on-premise (PortalGuard) delivery model. Our three-way IAM neutrality consists of:\n\u25cf\nfifteen MFA authentication factor choices, including our server-secured biometrics,\n\u25cf\nopen user directory choices including on premise, hybrid or full-Azure Active Directory, LDAP, IBM Domino, or custom SQL user directory; and\n\u25cf\nmultiple single sign on, or SSO, federation options, including SAML, OIDC, CAS and WS-Fed.\nThe forgoing allows our customers to combine and authenticate legacy and future technologies and to securely connect users to the technology that they choose. We design transparent compatibility of the BIO-key PortalGuard IDaaS with on-premise infrastructures and public and hybrid clouds.\nOur customers use the BIO-key PortalGuard IDaaS to secure their workforces and student populations and make their partner networks more collaborative. PortalGuard IDaaS provides more and secure experiences for their customers and end users, which enables our customers to future-proof their environments. PortalGuard IDaaS can be used as the central system for an organization\u2019s connectivity, access, authentication and identity lifecycle management needs across all of its users, technology and applications. We enable our customers to easily deploy, manage and secure applications and devices, and offer provisioning services using open source tools.\nDevelopers can leverage an extensive suite of API and modular SDK tools to build custom cloud, mobile and web application enrollment and authentication experiences that leverage BIO-key PortalGuard and WEB-key as the underlying identity management platform. Once deployed, PortalGuard allows administrators to enforce contextual access management decisions based on conditions such as user identity, device, geolocation, application destination identity, IP range, and time of day.\nOur customers use BIO-key to (i) manage and secure work-related IT access of their employees, contractors and supply chain partners, which we call workforce identity; and (ii) manage and secure the identities of users of their web properties, which we call customer identity.\nBIO-key PortalGuard and PortalGuard IDaaS for Workforce Identity. PortalGuard streamlines the way an organization\u2019s employees, contractors and supply chain partners connect to its applications and data from any device, while increasing user efficiency, preventing unauthorized delegation, credential sharing, and keeping digital environments secure through our MFA capabilities. We enable organizations to provide their workforces with immediate and secure access to every application from any device they use, without maintaining multiple credentials. Our multi-directory support interfaces with the directories in place at an organization, while allowing SQL-based custom directories where none presently exist. BIO-key PortalGuard Desktop allows customers to extend the BIO-key PortalGuard IDaaS to their existing on-premises and remote workstation Windows sign in.\nBIO-key PortalGuard and PortalGuard IDaaS for Customer Identity. BIO-key PortalGuard allows organizations to secure access to their online properties, while upgrading their customers\u2019 user experience by delivering self-enrollment and management for customer-facing cloud, mobile or web applications. We enable an organization\u2019s product team to layer BIO-key\u2019s MFA, SSO and self-service password reset, or SSPR, functionality into their cloud, web and mobile applications through federation standards or using our APIs. Our customers are able to centrally manage policies, audit and log access across their properties, leading to more seamless customer experiences.\nBIO-key VST and WEB-key; Products; Civil and Large-Scale ID Infrastructure\nWe have developed what we believe is the most discriminating and effective commercially available finger-based biometric technology. This technology is embedded in our PortalGuard product for enterprise security, providing customers with a unique capability to authenticate users without a phone or token, where appropriate, such as manufacturing, retail, call centers, and health care workers. Other markets for scalable biometric engines include government markets, large scale identity projects such as voter\u2019s registration, driver\u2019s license, national ID programs, and SIM card registration.\nWe also offer a full line of easy to use finger scanners for both enterprise and consumer markets. Our SideSwipe\u00ae, EcoID\u00ae and SidePass\u00ae finger readers can be used on any laptop, tablet or other device which contains a USB A or C port. We market and sell these fingerprint scanners through distributors and directly to end users via Amazon.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has led us to migrate to a remote business model for our sales, marketing, administrative and executive teams. Research and development and production are adjusting to the new landscape to maintain production as best as possible considering the conditions and regulations. Our transition to remote work has been highly successful, and our teams operate efficiently using our own IAM software to authenticate video conferencing applications and other collaboration tools. The COVID-19 pandemic has extended sales cycles and delayed deployments in most markets in which we operate, particularly in Africa. We continue to conduct business daily and are actively closing transactions throughout the current climate, with no changes to personnel.\nMarkets\nIdentity Management, User Authentication, Privilege Entitlement and Access Control\nOur products simplify the authentication process for enterprise users and consumers, while raising security levels. This allows our customers to meet new, stronger authentication requirements and security best practices across many industries, while delivering a superior end-user experience. Customers use our products to reduce risk of theft, fraud, loss, account takeover attacks, and unauthorized account sharing by limiting access to valuable assets, privileges, data, services, networks and places to only authorized individuals. Our products provide stronger identity binding and a superior user experience versus traditional credentialing systems, which utilize a physical or knowledge-based electronic credential to authenticate the holder, but fail to authenticate the actual user in addition to the token. Both commercial enterprises and the public sector have seen a shift in the requirement for stronger authentication, and the FBI, NIST and industry thought leaders such as SalesForce and Microsoft have encouraged entities to enhance their security posture by implementing stronger 2-factor authentication (2FA) or MFA. We believe the market for advanced user MFA, including fingerprint biometrics, extends to nearly every industry segment and the market opportunity for our products is massive, global and growing.\nHistorically, our largest market has been access control within highly regulated industries like government and healthcare. However, we are witnessing a change in the landscape as organizations within all industries and of all sizes are embracing biometric technology and MFA as a security and workflow solution. Championed by the millions of users that have been successfully introduced to biometrics by companies such as Apple and Samsung, today\u2019s users have witnessed the security and convenience benefits of biometric technology in their phones and welcome the same user experience to access applications without passwords.\nMore recently, in connection with the acquisition of PistolStar we have developed a large customer base in the higher education vertical. Colleges and universities throughout the United States use our PortalGuard single sign on platform. As colleges and universities continue to operate in remote environments, we have seen additional demand for our solutions.\nUpon introducing a series of compact fingerprint readers, we saw an immediate increase in inquiries from both commercial companies seeking an alternative to passwords, and from consumers recognizing that they could use SidePass, SideSwipe or EcoID to replace their Windows passwords and enable Windows Hello without replacing or upgrading laptops or tablets.\nIn October 2015, we established BIO-key Hong Kong for purposes of establishing relationships and conducting business is the Asia Pacific Region. Through our Hong Kong subsidiary, we support the growing demand for secure identification and authentication in the region.\nWe believe there is potential for significant market growth in the following key areas:\n\u25cf\nCorporate network access control, corporate campuses, computer networks, and applications.\n\u25cf\nLarge scale identification projects, especially in Africa and the surrounding regions.\n\u25cf\nGovernment funded initiatives, including the state board of elections.\n\u25cf\nInternational law enforcement use case applications as prospects see us as a global leader in the biometric technology space as witnessed by our agreement with the Israeli Defense Force, and the Singapore and Dubai Police departments.\n\u25cf\nConsumer mobile credentialing, including mobile payments, credit and payment card programs, data and application access, and commercial loyalty programs.\n\u25cf\nDemand for BIO-key hardware products from Windows 10 users and Fortune 500 companies.\n\u25cf\nGovernment services and highly regulated industries including, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, drivers licenses, campus and school ID, passports/visas.\n\u25cf\nThe Asia Pacific region.\n\u25cf\nNew remote authentication challenges, including those created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBusiness Model\nOur business model is focused on the following key areas:\nMarket\nDrivers\nThe frequent announcements of supply chain breaches, ransomware attacks, and administrative access compromises have highlighted the shortcomings of mainstream MFA and security approaches, which leave far too much responsibility on end-users to comply with cyber-hygiene policies. BIO-key biometrics remove the human error and human nature elements from the authentication process, while making the end user\u2019s access easier than ever. The current climate of broad enterprise adoption of MFA to replace passwords, an ongoing upgrade cycle of Microsoft Windows 10, and accompanying moves to Windows Hello for Business, all present broad opportunities for us to leverage our unique differentiators and exploit the gaps in existing IAM technology approaches. One of those gaps is the challenge of authenticating users that \u201crove\u201d among workstations. A second gap is preventing unauthorized account sharing and delegation.\nOEM\nCustomers\nWe will continue to prioritize securing agreements with OEM customers. The history of success supporting NCR, McKesson, Omnicell, and LexisNexis provides an established footprint that we intend to build upon. As OEM customers embed our solutions within their products, the customer benefits from the enhanced security and workflow, and frees them from investing in R&D to manage an IAM infrastructure of their own. OEM customers\u2019 ordering patterns are more predictable and OEM customers generally require lower service and support resourcing.\nHighly\nRegulated\nIndustries\nGovernment ID projects and healthcare organizations, including hospitals, clinics, and small private practices present a strong opportunity for us. Additionally, the financial services industry, including banks and credit unions has grown substantially.\nPartner\nModel\nIn 2020, we took major steps to upgrade our partner program. We hired dedicated resources and announced the launch of a new Channel Alliance Partner program (CAP) focused on partnering with select value added resellers, integrators, and resellers.\nMicrosoft\nPartnership\nWe are a Microsoft Partner and our line of compact fingerprint scanners has been tested and qualified by Microsoft to support Windows Hello and Windows Hello for Business.\nHardware\nHardware products generated 16% of our revenue in 2020. EcoID has emerged as our most popular scanner for enterprise deployments. For customers that require the highest level of security, PIV-Pro is a FIPS complaint fingerprint scanner, suitable for highly regulated industries and organizations that want a best-in-class solution.\nWe have grown our business through a combination of organic growth and the strategic acquisition of PistolStar. We expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of select businesses and assets in the IAM space. In furtherance of this strategy, we are active in the industry and regularly evaluate businesses that we believe will either provide an entry into new market verticals or be synergistic with our existing operations and in either case, be accretive to earnings. We cannot provide any assurance as to whether we will be able to complete any acquisition and if completed, successfully integrate any business we acquire into our operations. Please see the section captioned \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d for additional information regarding acquisition risks.\nMarketing and Distribution\nWe sell our products directly through our field and inside sales teams, as well as indirectly through our network of channel partners. Through our CAP, we have partnered with more than 40 resellers, system integrators and other distribution partners. We are committed to aggressively growing this program in 2021.\nWe partner with leading application, managed service and infrastructure vendors, such as Ingram, D&H, Insight, NGEN, Amazon Web Services, UCROO Campus, Software House International (SHI), Virtual Graffiti, Atlassian, and ProCirrus.\nWe offer our software under a SaaS term license and generate annual recurring revenue (ARR) primarily by selling multi-year subscriptions to our software. We employ a customer success team, focused on customer satisfaction and early remediation.\nIn 2020, we announced that we had secured two of the largest contracts in our history, with our partner Technology Transfer Institute. The contracts, valued at a combined $75,000,000, are for large-scale identification projects in Nigeria. Under the first contract, we will provide biometric authentication to support the infrastructure of a new e-commerce project developed with the expectation to generate more than one million jobs in Nigeria. The second contract provides for BIO-key hardware and software to be used by a leading African telecommunications company to secure internal access to customer data. Currently Africa and the surrounding regions are receiving government funding to expand the use of biometric authentication solutions to help establish trustworthy government programs and reduce fraud. These historic opportunities are expected to showcase our ability to support large scale projects utilizing our core biometric authentication software engine, WEB-key and hardware to support large-scale enrollment and ID verification. We received our first purchase order under these contracts in the fourth quarter of 2020 which we expect to ship in the first half of 2021 upon receipt of prepayment of the order. The COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to delay the rollout of these programs.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nWe develop and own significant intellectual property and believe that our intellectual property is fundamental to our biometric operation:\nPatents\nWe own patented technologies and trade secrets developed or acquired by us.\nIn May 2005, the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office issued patent 6,895,104 for our Vector Segment fingerprint technology (VST), our core biometric analysis and identification technology. With the payment of all maintenance fees, this patent will expire on March 4, 2023.\nOn October 3, 2006, we announced that our patent for a biometric authentication security framework had been granted by the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office. The patent No. 7,117,356 was issued to us for a biometric authentication security framework that enhances commercial and civil biometric use. Our authentication security framework protects privacy and security of cloud or network-based authentications while also facilitates ease of use of biometric systems. The technology that this patent is based on is the foundation for the authentication security incorporated in our WEB-key product line. WEB-key is a mature enterprise authentication solution that functions in a wide variety of application environments. The solution supports a variety of implementation alternatives including card technologies for \u201ctwo-factor\u201d authentication and also supports \u201csingle-factor\u201d authentication. Partners and customers implementing our WEB-key software to provide convenient and secure user identity include a number of institutions including the Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Computer Associates Site Minder, Oracle Access Manager and many other enterprise and solutions-based systems.

We also acquired the following unregistered trademarks: \u201cPortalGuard NebulaTM\u201d, \u201cPassword PowerTM\u201d and \u201cScoochTM\u201d.\nCopyrights and trade secrets\nWe take measures to ensure copyright and license protection for our software releases prior to distribution When possible, the software is licensed in an attempt to ensure that only licensed and activated software functions to its full potential. We also take measures to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets.\nResearch and Development\nOur PortalGuard IAM product line is mature, with hundreds of active customers, and we are adding additional factors and capabilities to the product, as well as enhancing the self-management for the functionally equivalent PortalGuard IDaaS offering. Our VST and WEB-key biometric platforms are mature, stable, and widely-deployed and we concentrate our research and development efforts on enhancing the functionality, reliability and integration of our current products as well as acquiring and developing new and innovative products and solutions for providing broader access to the BIO-key user experience.\nAlthough we believe that our identification technology is one of the most advanced and discriminating fingerprint technologies available today, the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change and evolving standards and use-cases. In order to maintain our position in the market, we will need to continue to upgrade and refine our existing technologies as new standards become relevant to our customers and markets.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred $1,396,436 and $1,331,667, respectively, on research and development.\nIn future periods our R&D efforts will remain focused on updating and advancing our core software products including PortalGuard and PortalGuard IDaaS, WEB-key and VST. These products are critical to support the anticipated growth in enterprise IAM and large-scale ID projects.\nCompetition\nThe IAM MFA and SSO market has many providers of solutions in either standalone or IAM suite delivery models. We believe that our unique differentiator in this market is the incorporation of an unparalleled server-secured biometric authentication capability among our 15 authentication factors. In addition to companies that provide existing commonplace methods of restricting access to facilities and logical access points such as pass cards, PIN numbers, passwords, locks and keys, there are numerous companies involved in the development, manufacturing and marketing of fingerprint biometrics products to commercial, government, law enforcement and prison markets. These companies include, but are not limited to, 3M (Cogent), NEC, and MorphoTrak.\nThe majority of sales for automated fingerprint identification products in the market to date have been deployed for government agencies, healthcare facilities, and law enforcement applications. The consumer and commercial markets represent areas of growth potential for biometrics, led by the use of mobile devices.\nThe epidemic of security and data breaches reported over the past few years is one of the driving factors for identifying new methods of protecting valuable data. After attempting to create a more sophisticated password or more efficient token or PIN, it has become apparent that each of these methods are easily compromised, and the downside risks are significant.\nWe have also seen FIDO-compliant keys enter the market, led by Yubico\u2019s YubiKey, a USB key that acts as a credential for access. Keys alone do not meet the needs of large organizations for which key sharing and lost keys are concerns. We are introducing a line of low-cost USB keys and they do not offer the security benefits of biometric technology as they can be easily lost or stolen and replacement costs / managing the product becomes a growing expense.\nWith respect to competing biometrics technologies, each has its strengths and weaknesses and none has emerged as a market leader:\n\u25cf\nFingerprint identification is generally viewed as very accurate, inexpensive and non-intrusive and is the dominant biometric in use today and will be for the foreseeable future;\n\u25cf\nPalm Vein scanning is expensive, technique-sensitive, and offers mobility challenges;\n\u25cf\nIris scanning is viewed as accurate, but the hardware is significantly more expensive; and\n\u25cf\nFacial recognition can have privacy concerns with work-from-home use, and is typically highly dependent on ambient lighting conditions, angle of view, and other factors.\nGovernment Regulations\nVarious state, federal and EU privacy laws govern the collection, storage, use and any sale of biometric-related data. To the extent that BIO-key\u2019s IDaaS offerings include the collection and storage of customer users\u2019 personal or biometric data, we operate as a processor of such data. Our WEB-key platform includes compliance features to ensure automated compliance with these laws including collection of informed written consent during enrollment workflows and robust auditing to control and report on the retention of biometric data and removal requests. Additionally, our customers have access to these tools to maintain their own compliance, including deletion of user data when business relationships terminate.\nWe believe in biometric privacy rights, and that both users and their organizations benefit from a responsibly operated biometric identity infrastructure. We actively participate in industry privacy workgroups as recognized biometric subject matter experts in order to influence and keep abreast of any proposed changes to these regulations. Beyond these regulations, we are not currently subject to direct regulation by any government agency, other than regulations generally applicable to businesses or related to specific project requirements. In the event of any international sales, we would be subject to various domestic and foreign laws regulating such exports and export activities.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nAs of the date of this report, we have not incurred any material expenses relating to our compliance with federal, state, or local environmental laws and do not expect to incur any material expenses in the foreseeable future.\nSeasonality\nGenerally, our revenues do not exhibit a seasonal pattern, however, revenue is affected by customer budgeting, government fiscal year planning, and capital budgets.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of the date of this report, we employed thirty-four individuals on a full-time basis as follows: (i) sixteen in engineering, customer support, and research and development; (ii) eight in finance and administration; and (iii) ten in sales and marketing. We also use two consultants who provide engineering and technical services on a part-time basis, three full-time factory contractors, and three part-time factory contractors in China. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good.\nAvailable Information\nWe maintain a website with the address www.BIO-key.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are available on our website, without charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the SEC.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and other parts of this Report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. All forward-looking statements included in this Report are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth in the section captioned \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d in Item 1A and elsewhere in this Report.\nThe following Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help you understand our Company. This discussion is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Report.\nEffective November 20, 2020, we implemented a reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock at a ratio of 1-for-8. All share figures are reflected on a post-split basis.\nOverview\nWe are a leading identity access management (IAM) platform provider for the enterprise and large-scale customer and civil ID solutions. Built to leverage BIO-key\u2019s world-class biometric core platform among 14 other strong authentication factors, BIO-key PortalGuard and hosted PortalGuard IDaaS are platforms that enable our customers to securely and easily assure that only the right people can access the right systems. PortalGuard goes beyond traditional multifactor authentication (MFA) solutions by addressing sizeable gaps, such as allowing roving users to biometrically authenticate at any workstation without using their phones or tokens, eliminating unauthorized account delegation, detecting duplicate users, and accommodating in-person identification.\nMillions use BIO-key every day to securely access a variety of cloud, mobile and web applications, on-premise and cloud-based hypervisor servers from all of their devices. Employees, contractors, students and faculty sign in through PortalGuard to seamlessly and securely access the applications they need to do their important work, without relying on personal phone use or per-user tokens. Organizations use our platform to securely collaborate with their supply chain and partners, and to provide their customers with flexible, resilient user experiences online or in-person.\nLarge-scale customer and civil ID customers use our scalable biometric management platform and FBI-certified scanner hardware to manage enrollment, de-duplication and authentication for millions of users. One large bank has enrolled and identifies over 10 million of their customers in branches on a daily basis.\nWe sell our branded biometric and FIDO authentication hardware as accessories to our IAM platforms, so that customers can have a single vendor providing all components of their IAM solution. We do not mandate BIO-key hardware and our NIST-certified biometric platform is unique in that it supports interoperable mixing and matching combinations of fingerprint scanners regardless of manufacturer, so that the right scanner can be deployed for the right use case, without mandating the user of a particular scanner.\nSecurity-conscious developers leverage our platform APIs and federation interfaces to securely and efficiently embed biometric and MFA identity capabilities into their software. Our approach to IDaaS allows our customers to efficiently scale their security and identity infrastructures to protect both internal cloud workforce- and external customer-facing applications.\nWe operate a SaaS business model with customers subscribing to term use of our software for annual recurring revenue. We sell our products directly through our field and inside sales teams, as well as indirectly through our network of channel partners including resellers, system integrators, master agents and other distribution partners. Our subscription fees include a term license of hosted or on-premise product and technical support and maintenance of our platform. We base subscription fees primarily on the products used and the number of users enrolled in our platform. We generate subscription fees pursuant to noncancelable contracts with a weighted average duration of approximately one year.\nPortalGuard is used by our customers to manage and secure IT access by their employees, contractors and partners, which we call workforce identity. PortalGuard is also used to manage and secure the identities of an organization\u2019s customers through integration of APIs we have developed and industry-standard federation standards, which we call customer identity. We invoice customers in advance in annual and multi-year prepaid installments for subscriptions to our platforms.\nStrategic Outlook\nHistorically, our largest market has been access control within highly regulated industries such as government, financial services, and healthcare. In 2019 we became the go-to biometric authentication provider for board of election offices as eight offices deployed our hardware and software to secure internal access to the voter registration database. We will seek to extend this footprint in 2021 and beyond.\nIn 2020, we announced that we had secured two of the largest contracts in our history, with our partner Technology Transfer Institute. The contracts, valued at a combined $75,000,000, are for large-scale identification projects in Africa and Nigeria. Under the first contract, we will provide biometric authentication to support the infrastructure of a new e-commerce project developed with the expectation to generate more than one million jobs in Nigeria. The second contract provides for BIO-key hardware and software to be used by a leading African telecommunications company to secure internal access to customer data. Currently Africa and the surrounding regions are receiving government funding to expand the use of biometric authentication solutions to help establish trustworthy government programs and reduce fraud. We received our first purchase order under these contracts in the fourth quarter of 2020 which we expect to ship in the first half of 2021 upon receipt of prepayment for the order. The COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to delay the rollout of these programs.\nWe plan to have a more significant role in the IAM market which continues to expand. We plan to offer customers a suite of authentication options that complement our biometric solutions. The more well-rounded offerings of authentication options will allow customers to customize their approach to authentication all under one umbrella.\nWe expect to grow our business within government services and highly-regulated industries in which we have historically had a strong presence including financial services, higher education, and healthcare. We believe that continued heightened security and privacy requirements in these industries, and as colleges and universities continue operating in remote environments, we will generate increased demand for security solutions, including biometrics. In addition, we expect that the compatible, yet superior portable biometric user experience offered by our technology for Windows 10 users will accelerate the demand for our computer network log-on solutions and fingerprint readers. Through value add-offerings via direct sales, resellers, and strategic partnerships with leading higher education platform providers, we will continue to grow our installed base.\nOur primary sales strategies are focused on (i) increased marketing efforts into the IAM market, (ii) dedicated pursuit of large-scale identification projects across the globe and (iii) growing our channel alliance program which we have grown to more than forty participants and is starting to generate incremental revenues.\nA second component of our growth strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions of select businesses and assets in the IAM space. In furtherance of this strategy, we are active in the industry and regularly evaluate businesses that we believe will either provide an entry into new market verticals or be synergistic with our existing operations and in either case, be accretive to earnings. We cannot provide any assurance as to whether we will be able to complete any acquisition and if completed, successfully integrate any business we acquire into our operations.\nRecent Developments\nAs discussed under \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d above, an outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus, COVID-19, has been recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. This outbreak has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world. In response to this coronavirus outbreak the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions, including imposing restrictions on travel and business operations and requiring individuals to limit time outside of their homes. Given the uncertainty regarding the spread of this coronavirus, the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nThe complications caused by COVID-19 has forced organizations to quickly adapt to a work from home remote business model. This increases the risk of unauthorized users, phishing attacks, and hackers who are eager to take advantage of the challenges of securing remote workers. We believe that biometrics should play a key role in remote user authentication.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nTwo Year % trend\nYears ended\nDecember 31,\nRevenues\nServices\n%\n%\nLicense fees\n%\n%\nHardware\n%\n%\n%\n%\nCosts and other expenses\nCost of services\n%\n%\nCost of license fees\n%\n%\nCost of hardware\n%\n%\n%\n%\nGross Profit (Loss)\n%\n%\nOperating expenses\nSelling, general and administrative\n%\n%\nResearch, development and engineering\n%\n%\nTotal operating expenses before impairment\n%\n%\nImpairment of resalable software license rights\n%\n%\nOperating loss\n%\n%\nOther income (expense)\nTotal other income (expense)\n%\n%\nNet loss\n%\n%\nRevenues and Costs and other expenses\n2020 - 2019\n$ Chg\n% Chg\nRevenues\nServices\n$ 1,432,228\n$ 925,245\n$ 506,983\n%\nLicense fees\n962,038\n442,649\n519,389\n%\nHardware\n442,516\n899,634\n(457,118\n)\n%\nTotal Revenue\n$ 2,836,782\n$ 2,267,528\n$ 569,254\n%\nCosts and other expenses\nServices\n$ 502,214\n$ 272,318\n$ 229,896\n%\nLicense fees\n49,891\n916,112\n(866,221\n)\n%\nHardware\n242,721\n1,272,815\n(1,030,094\n)\n%\nTotal Costs and other expenses\n$ 794,826\n$ 2,461,245\n$ (1,666,419\n)\n%\nRevenues\nRevenue increased $569,254 or 25% to $2,836,782 in 2020 as compared to $2,267,528 in 2019 due to the factors stated below.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, service revenues included approximately $1,383,000 and $904,000, respectively, of recurring maintenance and support revenue, and approximately $49,000 and $21,000, respectively, of non-recurring custom services revenue. Recurring service revenue increased 53% from 2019 to 2020 which is due largely to the additional service revenue from PistolStar customers in the last six months of 2020. Non-recurring custom services increased 134% due to increased new customer installations. As our customer base continues to grow, we expect the service revenue to increase in future periods.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, license revenue increased approximately $519,000 or 117% to $962,038. We increased both the variation and number of customers, including additional revenue from the PistolStar acquisition in the last six months of 2020.\nHardware sales decreased by approximately $457,000, or 51%, to $442,516 in 2020 as a result of fewer large customer deployments, and reduced lock sales. Fingerprint reader sales decreased approximately $412,000, or 48%, while the biometric locks decreased approximately $45,000, or 98% from 2019.\nCosts of goods sold\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of service increased approximately 84% to $502,214, due to the increased revenue and the direct support for the PortalGuard installations.\nLicense costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased approximately 95% to $49,891. The decrease was attributable primarily to the amortization and actual deployments of the software rights of approximately $15,000 in 2020 compared to $884,000 in 2019.\nHardware costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased approximately 81% to $242,721. The decrease was attributable primarily to the write down of lock inventory and parts as a result of the discontinuance of lock sales in the US in 2019 and reduction of hardware sales.\nSelling, general and administrative\n2020 - 2019\n$ Chg\n% Chg\n$ 5,848,687\n$ 5,036,820\n$ 811,867\n%\nSelling, general and administrative costs for year ended December 31, 2020 were $5,848,687 representing a 16% increase over 2019. The increase included expenses associated with new marketing personnel and web-site integration of PistolStar, additional costs associated with the PistolStar office staff and expenses, one-time integration costs incurred in connection the acquisition of PistolStar, increased accounting and legal fees incurred in connection with financing transactions, and costs associated with establishing our African subsidiary. These amounts were offset in part by a decrease in travel, bad debt expense, factor fees, and non-cash compensation.\nResearch, development and engineering\n2020 - 2019\n$ Chg\n% Chg\n$ 1,396,436\n$ 1,331,667\n$ 64,769\n%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, research, development and engineering costs were $1,396,436 representing a 5% increase over 2019, as a result of an increase in recruiting expenses and the addition of PistolStar expenses.

Also included in other income (expense) for 2020 was a loss on the extinguishment of a convertible note in the approximate amount of $500,000 resulting from the issuance of an amended and restated convertible note, for which the issuer did not grant a concession. These amounts were partially offset by amounts received under the Payment Protection Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d) the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration of approximately $341,000 and interest income of approximately $31,000.\nThe 2019 total includes the write-off of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs related to the April 2019 and June 2019 notes repaid prior to maturity.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOperating activities overview\nNet cash used for operations during the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $4,950,000. Items of note included:\n\u25cf\nNet positive cash flows related to non-cash expenses of approximately $6,104,000.\n\u25cf\nNet negative cash flows related to changes in accounts receivable, prepayments, accounts payable, accruals, lease liabilities, and deferred revenue of approximately $1,457,000 and our net loss for the period.\nInvesting activities overview\nApproximately $2,230,000 was used for investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 and related primarily to the acquisition of PistolStar.\nFinancing activities overview\nApproximately $24,094,000 was provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisting of the issuance of common stock and warrants in our underwritten public offering, exercise of warrants and issuance of convertible notes. These amounts were offset by repayment of convertible notes, repayment of notes payable and other related party debt, debt service fees, and costs associated with the issuance of our securities.\nSources of Liquidity\nSince our inception, our capital needs have been principally met through proceeds from the sale of equity and debt securities. We expect capital expenditures to be less than $100,000 during the next twelve months.\nThe following sets forth our primary sources of capital during the previous two years:\nWe entered into an accounts receivable factoring arrangement with a financial institution (the \u201cFactor\u201d) which has been extended to October 31, 2021 and may be discontinued at that time. Pursuant to the terms of the arrangement, from time to time, we sell to the Factor a minimum of $150,000 per quarter of certain of our accounts receivable balances on a non-recourse basis for credit approved accounts. The Factor remits 35% of the foreign and 75% of the domestic accounts receivable balance to us (the \u201cAdvance Amount\u201d), with the remaining balance, less fees, forwarded to us once the Factor collects the full accounts receivable balance from the customer. In addition, from time to time, we receive over advances from the Factor. Factoring fees range from 2.75% to 15% of the face value of the invoice factored and are determined by the number of days required for collection of the invoice. We expect to continue to use this factoring arrangement periodically to assist with our general working capital requirements due to contractual requirements.\nOn April 4, 2019, we issued a $550,000 secured convertible debenture to an institutional investor with a maturity date of November 15, 2019 which was convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $12.00 per share. On July 10, 2019, this debenture was redeemed and repaid in full in connection with the financing described below.\nOn June 14, 2019, we issued a $157,000 principal amount convertible note to an institutional investor with a maturity date of November 14, 2019 which was convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $12.00 per share.

At closing, $2,550,000 was funded. The Original Note was secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and properties and was convertible into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price of $12.00 per share. Pursuant to amendments in the first and second quarter of 2020, we amended the Original Note to increase the principal amount to $3,789,000 as a result of interest and penalties, accelerated the maturity date to June 13, 2020, and reduced the conversion price to $5.20 per share (the \u201cAmended Note\u201d). The full balance of the Amended Note has been converted into common stock.\nOn January 13, 2020, we issued a $157,000 principal amount convertible note to an institutional investor with a maturity date of June 13, 2020 which was convertible into common stock at a conversion price of $12.00 per share.

We received total proceeds of approximately $341,000 which was used in accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act. The full amount of the SVB Note has been forgiven.\nOn May 6, 2020, we issued a $2,415,000 principal amount senior secured convertible note. The principal amount was due and payable in five equal monthly installments of $268,333 beginning seven months after the funding date with the remaining balance due twelve months after the date of funding. Following the completion of the underwritten offering consummated in July 2020 discussed below, all outstanding amounts relating this note were paid in full.\nOn June 29, 2020, we issued a $1,811,250 principal amount senior secured convertible note. The principal amount was due and payable in nine equal monthly installments of $201,250 beginning four months after the funding date. Following the completion of the underwritten offering consummated in July 2020 discussed below, all outstanding amounts relating this note were paid in full.\nOn July 23, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of shares of common stock and warrants resulting in net proceeds of approximately $22.7 million, inclusive of the over-allotment and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We used approximately $4.2 million of the net proceeds to repay all outstanding amounts due under outstanding convertible promissory notes at that time.\nLiquidity Outlook\nAt December 31, 2020, our total cash and cash equivalents were approximately $17,000,000, as compared to approximately $79,000 at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020 we had working capital of approximately $17,000,000.\nAs discussed above, we have historically financed our operations through access to the capital markets by issuing secured and convertible debt securities, convertible preferred stock, common stock, and through factoring receivables. We currently require approximately $735,000 per month to conduct our operations, a monthly amount that we have been unable to consistently achieve through revenue generation. During 2020, we generated approximately $2,837,000 of revenue, which is below our average monthly requirements. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue to fund current operations and execute our business plan, we may need to obtain additional third-party financing. As of the date of this report, we do not expect that we will need to obtain additional financing during the next twelve months.\nOur long-term viability and growth will depend upon the successful commercialization of our technologies and our ability to obtain adequate financing. To the extent that we require such additional financing, no assurance can be given that any form of additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, that adequate financing will be obtained to meet our needs, or that such financing would not be dilutive to existing stockholders. If available financing is insufficient or unavailable or we fail to continue to generate sufficient revenue, we may be required to further reduce operating expenses, delay the expansion of operations, be unable to pursue merger or acquisition candidates, or in the extreme case, not continue as a going concern.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are in the opinion of management reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note A of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations, as listed below:\n1. Revenue Recognition\n2. Business Combinations\n3. Goodwill and acquired intangible assets\n4. Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, including Intangible Assets\n5. Research and Development Expenditures\n6. Income Taxes\n7. Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation",

    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are developing products and services around our patented polymorphic encryption technology, which is designed to enable secure and private data transmission. Through our licensing program, we are offering what we believe to be the first secure, commercially viable, advanced Polymorphic Encryption Core, or PEC, data-in-motion product that can be used in virtually any commercial data security industry or in sensitive application. We believe that our PEC data-in-motion product allows our customers to securely send data, with little setup time required.\nBeginning in 2019, we retained an entirely new management team. Our current management restructured our business to focus our resources on only products and services that we believe are deliverable, have viable economic potential, and may be publicly disclosed without adversely affecting our competitive position. The core of our product and service offerings will continue to be built around our patents and encryption technology. We believe that our Cipherloc Polymorphic Encryption Engine Core technology is a highly secure data protection technology, which has received a validation certificate from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\nPrior to September 30, 2021, we were a Texas corporation. We are now a Delaware corporation. Our headquarters is located at 6836 Bee Cave Road, Building 1, Suite 279, Austin, TX 78746.\nThe transition to becoming a Delaware corporation was approved by our shareholders at our 2021 annual meeting that was held on September 13, 2021. In addition to the reincorporation in Delaware, our shareholders approved other governance actions designed to reduce risk and accelerate our growth were approved by the shareholders. Other actions by our shareholders at the annual meeting included:\n\u25cf Election of Anthony Ambrose, Sammy Davis, David Chasteen and Tom Wilkinson to our board of directors;\n\u25cf Ratification of the appointment of Briggs & Veselka Co. as our independent auditor;\n\u25cf Approval and adoption of our 2021 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan;\n\u25cf Granting discretionary authority to our board of directors to combine the outstanding shares of our common stock into a lesser number of outstanding shares in a reverse stock split, with the exact ratio to be determined by our board of directors, within a range of 1-for-2 to a maximum of 1-for-20;\n\u25cf Approval an amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to eliminate the statutory preemptive rights pursuant to Section 21.208 of the Texas Business Organizations Code in the event that the reincorporation from the State of Texas to the State of Delaware is not consummated;\n\u25cf Approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of a resolution approving named executive officer compensation; and\n\u25cf Approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of future non-binding advisory votes regarding future named executive officer compensation to occur every three years.\nRecent Transaction\nBetween March 31, 2021 and April 16, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 55,549,615 shares of our common stock, and warrants to purchase an equal number shares of our common stock, for $0.18 per share of common stock sold, in a private placement. The price of $0.18 per share was equal to 80% of the closing sales price of our common stock on the OTCQB Market on March 30, 2021. The warrants issued with the shares of common stock have an exercise price of $0.36 per share, and may be exercised at any time prior to March 31, 2026. The warrants have anti-dilution protection that applies if we issue shares of our common stock at less than the $0.36 per share exercise price of the warrants.\nWe received approximately $10 million in gross proceeds from the sale of the shares and warrants. In connection with the private placement, we agreed to use the proceeds for working capital, and not for (i) debt repayment, other than the payment of trade payables in the ordinary course of our business or the repayment of funds we received under the paycheck protection program of the Cares Act, (ii) redemption of our stock, (iii) settlement of any litigation, or (iv) in violation of the law.\nPaulson Investment Company, LLC acted as the placement agent for the offering. Pursuant to our agreement then, we paid the placement agent a cash commission of $1,334,861, 13% of the gross proceeds we received from the placement, and we granted to the placement agent a ten-year warrant to purchase 8,332,439 shares of our common stock at the price of $0.18 per share.\nOn April 29, 2021, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC, registering the resale of up to 119,431,669 shares of our common stock, representing (i) the shares sold in the private placement referred to above, (i) the shares issuable upon exercise of warrants issued in that private placement, and (iii) the shares issuable upon exercise of warrants issued to the placement agent in the private placement. As a result of the filing of that registration statement, the holders of the registered shares may sell those shares into the market.\nProducts and Services\nWe have focused our development efforts on the commercial application of our technology by advancing a Software Development Kit or SDK, for our solution. We believe that this effort has advanced our technology from theory to commercial application in the form of several products, named Sentinel, Armor, and Shield, which we make available to licensees through our SDK. In the past, we have relied on indirect sales efforts. We are currently developing new products and services designed for direct sales to customers, rather than sales through third parties.\nOur core technology is protected by six patents that expire between 2034 and 2037.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenditures for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 were $616,746 and $1,689,455, respectively. During December of 2019, our management determined that the pending maturity of our patented technology justified a cessation of our academic research activities, including the elimination of our chief scientist\u2019s role in leading various academic efforts. We allocated the cost savings from ceasing those activities entirely to product development, product engineering, and revenue-generating sales activities. Our management continued to emphasis these three areas during fiscal year 2021 and intends to continue that emphasis in our fiscal year 2022 and beyond.\nCompetition\nThe encryption software market sector is highly competitive, subject to rapid change, and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of market participants.\nSome of our competitors have greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. Because of these and other factors, competitive conditions in the markets we compete in are likely to continue to intensify in the future. Increased competition could result in price reductions for our products and services, reductions in our net revenue and profit margins and the loss of our market share, any of which would likely harm our business.\nWe believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to serve our customers better than our competitors, and by offering new product enhancements, whether by internal development or acquisition. We also believe that we must provide product offerings that compete favorably against those of our competitors with respect to ease of use, reliability, performance, range of useful features, reputation and price.\nWe anticipate that we will face increasing pricing pressures from our competitors in the future. Since there are low barriers to entry into the encryption software market, which is subject to rapid technological change, we believe that competition in our market will persist and intensify in the future.\nIntellectual Property\nProtective Measures\nWe believe that our intellectual property is an important and vital asset, which enables us to develop, market, and sell our products and services, and enhance our competitive position. Our intellectual property includes our proprietary business and technical know-how, inventions, works of authorship, and confidential information. To protect our intellectual property, we rely primarily upon legal rights in trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, in addition to our policies and procedures, security practices, contracts, and relevant operational measures.\nWe protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information by entering into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, contractors, and other entities with which we do business. In addition, our license agreements related to our software and proprietary information includes confidentiality terms. These agreements are generally non-transferable. We also employ access controls and associated security measures to protect our facilities, equipment, and networks.\nPatents, Copyrights, Trademarks, and Licenses\nOur products, particularly our software and related documentation, are protected under domestic and international copyright laws and other laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights. Currently, we have six patents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We employ procedures to label copyrightable works with the appropriate proprietary rights notices, and we actively enforce our rights in the United States and abroad. However, these measures may not provide us with adequate protection from infringement, and our intellectual property rights may be challenged.\nOur Cipherloc logo is a registered trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In the United States, we are generally able to maintain our trademark rights and renew trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use.\nGovernment Regulation\nExport Control Regulations. We expect that all of our products will be subject to U.S. export control laws and applicable foreign government import, export and/or use requirements. The level of such control generally depends on the nature of the products in question. Often, the level of export control is impacted by the nature of the software and encryption incorporated into our products. In those countries where such controls apply, the export of our products may require an export license or authorization. However, even if a transaction qualifies for a license exception or the equivalent, it may still be subject to corresponding reporting requirements. For the export of some of our products, we may be subject to various post-shipment reporting requirements. Minimal U.S. export restrictions apply to all our products, whether or not they perform encryption functions. If we become a Department of Defense contractor in the future, certain registration requirements may be triggered by our sales. In addition, certain of our products and related services may be subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) if our software or services are specifically designed or modified for defense purposes. If we become engaged in manufacturing or exporting ITAR-controlled goods and services (even if we do not export such items), we will be required to register with the U.S. State Department.\nEnhancements to our existing products may be subject to review under the Export Administration Act to determine what export classification they will receive. In addition, any new products that we release in the future will also be subject to such review before we can export them. The U.S. Congress continues to discuss t the correct level of export control in possible anti-terrorism legislation. Such export regulations may be modified at any time. Modifications to these export regulations could reduce or eliminate our ability to export some or all of our products from the United States in the future, which could put us at a disadvantage in competing with companies located outside of the U.S. Modifications to U.S. export regulations could restrict us from exporting our existing and future products. Any such modifications to export regulations may put us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to selling our products internationally.\nPrivacy Laws. We may be subject to various international, federal and state regulations regarding the treatment and protection of personally identifying and other regulated information. Applicable laws may include U.S. federal laws and implementing regulations, such as the [GLBA and HIPAA], as well as state and international laws and regulations, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Some of these laws have requirements on the transmittal of data from one jurisdiction to another. In the event our systems are compromised, many of these privacy laws require that we provide notices to our customers whose personally identifiable data may have been compromised. Additionally, if we transfer data in violation of these laws, we could be subjected to substantial fines. To mitigate the risk of having such data compromised, we use encryption and other security to protect our databases.\nPersonnel\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have three full-time employees and one part-time employee. We also have four independent contractors that provide services to us. We anticipate that we will need to increase our staffing in the foreseeable future.",
    "item_7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Business\nWe are developing products and services around our patented polymorphic encryption technology, which is designed to enable secure and private data transmission. Through a licensing program, we are offering our Polymorphic Encryption Core, or PEC, which we believe to be the first secure commercially viable, advanced polymorphic data-in-motion product that is designed to be used in any commercial data security industry or in sensitive applications. To supplement our potential licensing revenue, we are building our own applications that leverage our PEC. We believe that our innovative and patented polymorphic technology provides resistant and performant solutions to the problem of quantum cracking through rapid deployment of our quantum encryption algorithm, which has been approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\nWe anticipate that our operating expenses for the next twelve months will require between $2.5 and $3.5 million of cash, which will come from the net proceeds we received from a private placement of our securities held between March 31, 2021 and April 16, 2021. We intend to manage our business such that our current cash reserves will allow us to reach positive cash flow from our operations, but we cannot assure you that will occur. Our proposed approach to managing our cash will initially emphasize demonstrating our products\u2019 capabilities with our current customers. We will follow those efforts with using our remaining cash to scale all of our functional areas, including product development, marketing, sales, customer support, and administration.\nWe intend to focus our product development efforts on building new software and services to work with our existing core technology, while continuing to support our existing licensees. These efforts will require more personnel, as well as more infrastructure. We expect the increase in product development activities will require approximately $1.0 million of our cash over the next 12 months. We plan to build the infrastructure we need to perform these new functions on modern technology, with scale and reliability. We plan to utilize cloud services to provide our customers with an interface that modern software provides, but also an ease of use that we believe encryption technologies desperately need. We believe that, if we are able to build our infrastructure, as described above, we will have a competitive advantage over most other participants in our market.\nWe intend to have our sales and marketing efforts emphasize qualified lead generation, using very focused industry messaging and engagement. We plan to participate in relevant cybersecurity and quantum computing industry events. We have also formed a board of advisors designed to help us identify the correct product focus areas and market segmentation. This board of advisors includes professionals from cybersecurity, technology business development and software marketing. We estimate that the expenses we will incur for sales and marketing during the next fiscal year will range between $500,000 and $750,000.\nOur administration costs are currently minimal. However, we expect that we will have to increase these costs if we are able to generate sufficient revenues and hire additional employees. Our administrative resources will have to be increased according to our demand to support our employees, increase accounting capacities, and expand our reporting and compliance capabilities. We expect that we will need additional personnel in our accounting and human resources functions to support these expected staff additions. We also plan to add software tools to help us manage our internal processes.\nWe expect that we will need to add customer support teams if and when potential customers adopt each of our product offerings. We project the costs of customer support for our fiscal year 2022 will likely range from $100,000 to $300,000. We believe that these funds will be used primarily for salaries and technology to support these efforts. These expenses will be included in our cost of goods sold.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made. Our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of different assumptions or conditions.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgment we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. The SEC has defined \u201ccritical accounting policies\u201d as those accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based upon this definition, our most critical estimates are accounting for software revenue recognition, and stock issued to employees and non-employees. Our most critical accounting policies applicable to the periods presented are noted below. For additional information see Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available, and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.\nOur critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, deferred income taxes, accounting for share-based payments, and litigation.\nRevenue Recognition. We adopted the new accounting revenue standard for revenue recognition, effective October 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method applied to those contracts that were not completed as of October 1, 2018. We present our results for reporting periods beginning after October 1, 2018 under this new guidance, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under previous revenue guidance. See Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Our determination whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately, versus together, may require significant judgment.\nOur judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price, or SSP, for each distinct performance obligation. For products and services aside from maintenance and support, we estimate SSP by adjusting the list price by historical discount percentages. SSP for software and hardware maintenance and support fees is based on the stated percentages of the fees charged for the respective products.\nOur perpetual and term software licenses have significant standalone functionality, and therefore revenue allocated to these performance obligations are recognized at a point in time upon electronic delivery of the download link and the license keys. For certain arrangements, we recognize revenue based upon usage or ratably over the term of the arrangement.\nOur product maintenance and support services are satisfied over time, as they are stand-ready obligations throughout the support period. As a result, we defer revenues associated with maintenance services and recognize the revenue ratably over the term of the applicable contract.\nWe recognize revenues associated with professional services upon customer acceptance.\nAccounting for Share-Based Payments. As discussed further in Note 8 (Stockholders Equity (Deficit)) to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, we account for share-based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the FASB on stock compensation.\nWe have used and expect to continue to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of share-based compensation expense. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected option term and risk-free interest rates. The assumptions used in computing the fair value of share-based compensation expense reflect our best estimates, but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions, many of which are outside of our control. We estimate expected volatility based primarily on historical daily price changes of our stock and other factors. The expected option term is the number of years that we estimate that the stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise. We determine the estimated expected term of the stock awards issued pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No. 110. If we had used other assumptions or estimates, the share-based compensation expense that we recorded for the years ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 could have been materially different. Furthermore, if we use different assumptions or estimates in future periods, our share-based compensation expense could be materially impacted.\nPursuant to ASC 718-20-35-7, Repurchase or Cancellation of Equity Awards, we charge to equity the amount of cash or other assets transferred (or liabilities incurred) to repurchase an equity award, to the extent that the amount paid does not exceed the fair value of the equity instruments repurchased at the repurchase date. We recognize any excess of the repurchase price over the fair value of the instruments repurchased as additional compensation cost.\nFiscal Year Ended September 30, 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2020\nOur revenue for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $15,417, a decrease of $32,566 from revenue of $47,983 for the year ended September 30, 2020. Our revenue recognized during the year ended September 30, 2021 was from sales that occurred during the prior fiscal year, with the revenue being recognized over the 12 months following the invoice as cash was collected from the applicable customers. We had no new sales during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, even though we were expecting sales during the period based upon information we received from our licenses. We did not record any cost of revenues for the years ended September 30, 2021 or September 30, 2020.\nOur general and administrative expenses decreased from $4,573,673 for the year ended September 30, 2020, to $2,597,881 for the year ended September 30, 2021. The decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily resulted from lower legal expenses of $845,228, an impairment gain related to our operating leases of $824,559, a decrease in payroll related expenses of $390,788, and decreases in various other office expenses of $139,775, such as professional fees and subscriptions, partially offset by an increase in corporate insurance of $174,558.\nOur sales and marketing expenses decreased to $96,125 for the year ended September 30, 2021, from $710,595 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a decrease in payroll expense of $323,904, a decrease in consulting of $192,650, a decrease in marketing costs of $59,301 and a decrease in travel related expenses of $38,615.\nOur research and development expenses decreased to $616,746 for the year ended September 30, 2021, from $1,689,455 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to a decrease in consulting expense of $771,125 and a decrease in payroll expense of $301,584.\nOur total other income increased to $191,052 for the year ended September 30, 2021, from $44,332 of other expense for the year ended September 30, 2020. The income resulted from the partial forgiveness of our PPP loan. Our other expenses for the year ended September 30, 2020 was the result of losses be recognized on the disposal of some of our fixed assets.\nWe had a net loss of $3,104,283 for the year ended September 30, 2021, compared to a net loss of $6,970,072 for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in our net loss was due to a significant reduction in expenses during the latter half of the year ended September 30, 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe had an accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2021 of $71,530,891. We expect to continue to generate operating losses until we can generate revenues sufficient to exceed our operating expenses. As of September 30, 2021, we had $5,783,994 in cash. We believe that our existing cash balances are sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our Statements of Cash Flows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nNet cash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $ (3,630,806 ) $ (6,646,091 )\nInvesting activities $ - $ (28,972 )\nFinancing activities $ 8,334,961 $ (84,570 )\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, we used $3,630,806 in operating activities, primarily attributable to our net loss of $3,104,283 during the period and negative non-cash items of $633,649, which were partially offset by a net positive change in net operating assets and liabilities of $107,126. Our non-cash items primarily consisted of an of impairment loss of $441,597 related to an operating lease that was terminated, and forgiveness of our PPP loan of $192,502. The change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in prepaid and other assets of $511,408, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $618,951. We used cash during the year to pay for the cost of general and administrative, sales and marketing, and research and development activities, totaling $3,310,752.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2020, we used $6,646,091in cash in operating activities, primarily attributable to our net loss of $6,970,072, non-cash items of $640,433 and a net change in net operating assets and liabilities of $316,452.

Consequently, there are potential inherent conflicts of interest in their acting as officers and directors of our company. Although the directors are engaged in other business activities, we anticipate they will devote an important amount of time to our affairs.\nOur officers and directors are now and may in the future become stockholders, officers or directors of other companies, which may be formed for the purpose of engaging in business activities similar to ours. Accordingly, additional direct conflicts of interest may arise in the future with respect to such individuals acting on behalf of us or other entities. Moreover, additional conflicts of interest may arise with respect to opportunities which come to the attention of such individuals in the performance of their duties or otherwise. Currently, we do not have a right of first refusal pertaining to opportunities that come to their attention and may relate to our business operations.\nOur officers and directors are, so long as they are our officers or directors, subject to the restriction that all opportunities contemplated by our plan of operation which come to their attention, either in the performance of their duties or in any other manner, will be considered opportunities of, and be made available to us and the companies that they are affiliated with on an equal basis. A breach of this requirement will be a breach of the fiduciary duties of the officer or director. If we or the companies with which the officers and directors are affiliated both desires to take advantage of an opportunity, then said officers and directors would abstain from negotiating and voting upon the opportunity. However, all directors may still individually take advantage of opportunities if we should decline to do so. Except as set forth above, we have not adopted any other conflict of interest policy with respect to such transactions.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a formal Code of Ethics applicable to all Board members, officers and employees. A copy of our Code of Ethics may be obtained without charge upon written request to Secretary, Cipherloc Corporation, 6836 Bee Cave Road, Bldg. 1, Suite 279, Austin, TX 78746."

This shift to the cloud will enable NETSOL\u2019s new customers to opt for a subscription-based pricing model rather than the traditional licensing model.\nNETSOL\u2019s clients include blue chip organizations, Dow-Jones 30 Industrials, Fortune 500 manufacturers, financial institutions, global vehicle manufacturers and enterprise technology providers, all of which are serviced by NETSOL\u2019s strategically placed support and delivery locations around the globe.\nFounded in 1997, NETSOL is headquartered in Calabasas, California. While the Company follows a global strategy for sales and delivery of its portfolio of solutions and services, it continues to maintain regional offices in the following locations:\n\u25cf North America\nLos Angeles Area\n\u25cf Europe\nLondon Metropolitan Area, Horsham\n\u25cf Asia Pacific\nLahore, Karachi, Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai, Jakarta and Sydney\nOUR BUSINESS\nCompany Business Model\nNETSOL believes that our strong technology solutions offer our customers a return on their investment and allows us to thrive in a hyper competitive and mature global marketplace.

NETSOL continues to underpin its proven and effective business model which is a combination of careful cost arbitrage, subject matter expertise, domain experience, scalability and proximity with its global and regional customers.\nNiche Market Focus\nBy specializing in leasing and financing solutions, we have gained a strong foothold in several global locations and a market leading position in the captive auto-finance segment. NETSOL has a significantly growing presence in the general asset finance space, including equipment and the big ticket financing industry together with startups and banks.\nSubject Matter Expertise\nOur dual expertise in enterprise technology implementation and financial application development has helped us emerge as a global player in the finance and leasing industry and secure a broad footprint across the major markets of North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. The Asia Pacific region has particularly benefitted from the organic growth in the fast-developing leasing automation industry, which is still nascent per Western standards.\nDomain Experience\nNETSOL has a strong presence in the captive auto-finance domain. With a collective experience of over two decades in Asia Pacific and Europe and of nearly four decades in North America, NETSOL is one of the few players in this niche industry with a global presence.\nProximity with Global and Regional Customers\nWe have offices across the world, located strategically to maintain close contact and proximity with our customers in various key markets. This has not only helped us in strengthening our customer relationships but also in building a deeper understanding of local market dynamics. Simultaneously, we are able to extend services and even support development through a combination of onsite and off-site resources. This approach has allowed us to offer blended rates to our customers by employing a unique and cost-effective global development model.\nWhile our business model is built around the development, implementation and maintenance of our suite of financial applications, we have employed the same facilities and competencies to extend our offerings into related segments, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf IT consulting and services\n\u25cf Business intelligence\n\u25cf Outsourcing services and software process improvement consulting\n\u25cf Maintenance and support of existing systems\n\u25cf Project management\n\u25cf Technology/start-up incubation\n\u25cf White label digital retailing for auto-captives\n\u25cf 3D mapping\nOur global operation is broken down into three regions: North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.

The implementation process may also include related software services such as configuration, data migration, training, gaps development and any other additional third-party interfaces. Even after implementation, customers seek enhancements and additions to improve their business processes. We charge these efforts in a man-day rate.\nPost implementation, our consultants may remain at the client site to assist the customer in smooth operations. After this phase, the regular maintenance and support services phase for the implemented software begins. In addition to the daily rate paid by the customer for each consultant, the customer also pays for all transportation-related expenses, boarding of the consultants, and a living allowance. Our involvement in all the above steps is priced to bring value to our customers and increase our profitability.\nCloud-enabled solutions are offered via seamless and rapid deployments. The swift speed of implementations for our cloud-ready products enables businesses to be more responsive and attain a competitive advantage.\nPRICING AND REVENUE STREAMS\nThe company\u2019s revenue streams are the outcome of the following four main areas:\n\u25cf Product licensing\n\u25cf Subscription-based pricing\n\u25cf Implementation and customization-related services\n\u25cf Post contract support-related services\nLicense fees can range to a multi-million-dollar fee for single or multiple module implementations. License revenue is realized with traditional, non-SaaS-based agreements, whereas SaaS-based agreements do not contain license fees and are offered via flexible, value-driven, subscription-based pricing. There are various attributes which determine the level of complexity, a few of which are: number of contracts; size of the portfolio; business strategy of the customer; internal business processes followed by the customer; number of business users; amount of customization required; complexity of data migration and branch network of the customer.\nWe recognize revenue from license contracts when the software has been delivered to the customer. Implementation-related services, including configuration, data migration and third-party interfaces are recognized as the services are performed. Post customer support services are then provided on a continued basis. The annual support fee, which typically is an agreed upon percentage of overall monetary value of the license, then becomes an ongoing revenue stream realized on a yearly basis. Revenue from software services includes fixed price and time and materials-based contracts and is recognized as the services are performed.\nAdditionally, in order to avoid lumpiness in our revenues and to ensure a predictable revenue base over coming years, the business has shifted to a new pricing strategy whereby the business is now offering its cloud-ready products at SaaS/subscription-based pricing models. Rapid deployments coupled with affordable prices/payment schedules is expected to lead the business towards volume-based selling. Moreover, this value-driven pricing plan is intended to decrease the initial buy-in cost for new customers by eliminating heavy license fees and provides an alternative to current customers seeking lower software usage and maintenance costs.\nALLIANCES\nDaimler South East Asia Pte. Ltd. (\u201cDSEA\u201d), (through the regional office Daimler Financial Services (\u201cDFS\u201d) Africa Asia Pacific), has established a \u201cCentre of Competence\u201d (\u201cCoC\u201d) in Singapore to facilitate the regional companies in product related matters. The DSEA CoC is powered by highly qualified technical and business personnel. In conjunction with our Asia Pacific region, the CoC supports DFS companies in twelve different countries in Asia and Africa and this list can increase as more DFS companies from other countries opt for NFS Ascent\u00ae. In July 2004, the company entered into a Frame Agreement with DFS for the Asia Pacific and Africa region. This agreement was renewed in 2008, 2010, 2013 and most recently in January 2016. The agreement serves as a guideline for managing the business relationship with DFS and the use of licensed products of the company by DFS and its affiliated companies.\nWe have strategic partnerships with Microsoft and CGI pertaining to cloud-hosting activities for our cloud-based products.

We also utilize CGI for managed services and cloud hosting-related activities for our engagements with their customers in Europe particularly.\nTECHNICAL AFFILIATIONS\nWe are a Microsoft Certified Silver Partner and an Oracle Certified Partner.\nMARKETING AND SELLING\nWe continue our optimism that we will experience ever increasing opportunities for our product and services offerings in 2021 and beyond. The objective of our marketing program is to create and sustain preference and loyalty for NETSOL. Marketing is performed at the corporate and business unit levels. The corporate marketing department has overall responsibility for communications, advertising, public relations and management of all digital owned and paid mediums including website, social media channels and collaboration with industry partners. In addition, corporate marketing oversees central marketing and communications programs for use by each of the business units.\nOur dedicated marketing personnel, within the regions, undertake a variety of marketing activities, including sponsoring focused client events to demonstrate our skills and products and participating in targeted conferences, webinars and holding private briefings with individual companies. We believe that the industry focus of our sales professionals and our business unit marketing personnel enhances their knowledge and expertise in these industries and will generate additional client engagements.\nGROWTH PROSPECTS FOR NFS ASCENT\u00ae\nGrowth prospects for NFS Ascent\u00ae are linked to the constant innovation in the product and its growing customer base across different geographic and product markets. NETSOL is eyeing key international markets for growth in sales. Its sales strategy not only focuses on expansion into new geographic markets, including the Americas, Europe, and further penetration of our leading position in Asia Pacific, but also within existing markets into new verticals with targeting of Tier 2 and Tier 3 prospects as well.\nGrowth in North America is expected to come from the potential market for replacement of legacy systems as well as acquisition of new customers. NFS Ascent\u00ae is aimed at providing a highly flexible and robust solution based on the latest technology and advanced architecture for North American customers looking to replace their legacy systems. We believe that NFS Ascent\u00ae can provide substantial competitive disruption to the market\u2019s lagging technology provided by incumbent vendors. The existing customer base may also represent latent demand for increased service and support revenues by offering business process optimization, customization and upgrade services. With a market ready product with successful implementation, the prospects for NFS Ascent\u00ae in the region are positive.\nFurther traction in Europe will come from NFS Ascent\u00ae deployed on the cloud, which will continue to allow the Europe division to support not only larger organizations, but also small and medium sized organizations including startups.\nGrowth in NETSOL\u2019s traditionally strong base in Asia Pacific is expected through diversification across market segments to include new customers in related banking and commercial lending areas. At the same time, the existing customer base is tapped for increased service and support revenues by offering enhanced features and new solutions to emerging customer needs. In addition, there is a potential for NFS Ascent\u00ae in Asia Pacific in the form of existing customers who are looking for replacement of their current system.\nIn China, NETSOL is a leader in the leasing and finance enterprise solution domain. With this position, NETSOL continues to enjoy demand for the current NFS\u2122 solution, as well as NFS Ascent\u00ae. NETSOL will continue strengthening its position within existing multinational auto manufacturers, as well as local Chinese captive finance and leasing companies.\nTHE MARKETS\nWe provide our services primarily to clients in global commercial industries. In the global commercial area, our service offerings are marketed to clients in a wide array of industries including, automotive, software, banks, higher education and financial services.\nThe Asian continent, including Australia and New Zealand, from the perspective of marketing, are targeted by the Asia Pacific Region from its Bangkok, Beijing, Jakarta, Lahore, Shanghai and Sydney facilities. The marketing for our core offerings in the Americas and Europe is carried out from our Los Angeles Area and London Metropolitan Area offices, respectively.\nPEOPLE AND CULTURE\nWe believe we have developed a strong corporate culture that is critical to our success. Our key values are delivering world-class quality software, client-focused timely delivery, leadership, long-term relationships, creativity, openness and transparency and professional growth. The services provided by NETSOL require proficiency in many fields, such as software engineering, project management, business analysis, technical writing, sales and marketing, and communication and presentation skills.\nDue to the growing demand for our core offerings and IT services, retention of technical and management personnel is essential. Our employee turnover was under 20% in 2021 with a goal to maintain the turnover level under 20% during the 2022 fiscal year and onwards. In addition, we are committed to improving key performance indicators such as efficiency, productivity and revenue per employee.\nTo encourage all employees to build on our core values, we reward teamwork and promote individuals that demonstrate these values. We believe that our growth and success are attributable in large part to the high caliber of our employees and our commitment to maintain the values on which our success has been based. We support gender diversity on a global basis. We are an equal opportunity employer with the largest concentration of female employees in Lahore, Pakistan and our U.S. headquarters.\nNETSOL believes it should give back to the community and employees as much as possible. Certain subsidiaries of ours are located in regions where basic services are not readily available. Where possible, NETSOL acts to not only improve the quality of life of its employees, but also the standard of living in these regions. Examples of such programs are as follows:\n\u25cf Humanitarian Relief: We are all aware of the devastation that can be wrought by natural disasters. We have historically supported earthquake and flood relief where the need is the greatest.\n\u25cf Literacy Program: Launched to educate our illiterate employees, the main objective of this program is to enable these employees to acquire basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills.\n\u25cf Higher Education and Science and Research Institutions: In order to support higher education in Pakistan, we have contributed endowments to NUST, Forman Christian College, and a few other universities who are focused on science and engineering.\n\u25cf Noble Cause Fund: A noble cause fund has been established to meet medical and education expenses of the children of the lower paid employees. Our employees voluntarily contribute a fixed amount every month to the fund and NETSOL matches the employee subscriptions with an equivalent contribution amount. A portion of this fund is also utilized to support social needs of certain institutions and individuals, outside of NETSOL.\n\u25cf Day Care Facility: NETSOL\u2019s human resources are its key assets and thus we take numerous steps to ensure the provision of basic comforts to our employees. In Pakistan, the provision of outside pre-school childcare is a rarity. With this in mind, a children\u2019s day care facility has been created near NETSOL\u2019s offices providing employees with peace of mind knowing their children are nearby and being taken care of by qualified staff in a child friendly facility. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, the facility is temporarily closed.\n\u25cf Preventative Health Care Program: In addition to the comprehensive out-patient and in-patient medical benefits, preventive health care has also been introduced. This phased program focuses on vaccination of our employees against such diseases as Hepatitis - A/B, Tetanus, Typhoid and Flu on a routine basis.\nThere is significant competition for employees with the skills required to perform the services we offer. We run an elaborate training program for different cadres of employees to cover technical skills and business domain knowledge, as well as communication, management and leadership skills. We believe that we have been successful in our efforts to attract and retain the highest level of talent available, in part because of the emphasis on core values, training and professional growth. We intend to continue to recruit, hire and promote employees who share our vision.\nAs of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 1,447 employees; comprised of 77% technical staff and 23% non-IT personnel.\nCOMPETITION\nNeither a single company, nor a small number of companies, dominate the IT market in the space in which we compete. A substantial number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those offered by NETSOL. Some of these are large computer manufacturers and computer consulting firms that have greater financial resources than NETSOL and, in some cases, may have greater capacity to perform services similar to those provided by NETSOL.\nWe compete chiefly against leading suppliers of IT solutions to the global asset finance and leasing industry, including names such as White Clarke Group, Alfa, Cassiopae, LineData, FIS, International Decision Systems (IDS) and Data Scan.\nIn the IT-based business services areas, we compete with both smaller local firms and many global IT services providers, including names such as Wipro, InfoSys, Satyam Infoway, HCL and TCS (Tata Consulting).\nCUSTOMERS\nNETSOL\u2019s solutions and services cater to a broad spectrum of finance and leasing businesses, from automotive captive finance companies to equipment finance and leasing companies to large regional banks.\nNETSOL\u2019s customers include world renowned auto manufacturers through their finance arms. NETSOL is a strategic business partner for Daimler and BMW (which consists of a group of many companies in different countries), which accounts for approximately 21.0% and 13.0%, respectively, of our revenue for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Other globally renowned auto captives that are customers of the company include Toyota, Nissan, Ford, and FIAT.\nOther customers of the company include equipment finance and leasing companies and banks worldwide such as GAC Sofinco, Paccar, Mololease, SCI, and BMO Harris, etc.\nGLOBAL OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA\nNETSOL divides its operations into three regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The regions consist of individual subsidiaries which operate as autonomous companies and are strategically managed on a regional basis.\nThe Americas\nMr. Peter Minshall joined NetSol Technologies Americas, Inc.

Mobley brings over two decades of industry experience to NETSOL with an accomplished background and domain-specific knowledge and expertise within the wholesale finance space.\nAt the starting of the previous financial year, NETSOL acquired the remaining stake in Virtual Lease Services (VLS) rebranded as Banking Works. Previously limited to being a UK-based portfolio and risk management servicing partner for business and consumer finance providers, Banking Works will now focus on supporting financial services businesses to achieve their own transformation ambitions. By acquiring the remaining stake, NETSOL became the outright owner of the organization. Banking Works recently announced the appointment of Mark Cawood, an industry veteran, as the company\u2019s new Managing Director. Mark Cawood will pick up the baton passed by Louise Ikonomides, who left Banking Works after over 20 years to pursue new ventures.

While Lahore, Pakistan continues to be a nucleus of NETSOL\u2019s delivery and research and development, Bangkok\u2019s expanded sales operation and client relations facility has grown into a back-up to the Lahore facility. With the continued growth of the Chinese market, our Beijing office continues to expand as both a sales and support facility. Finally, the Asia Pacific region maintains and will establish offices through the region as is necessary to support its customers and to explore potential new markets.\nOur APAC Region accounted for approximately 72.7% of our revenues in 2021. Information regarding financial data by geographic areas is set forth in Item 7 and Item 8 of this Annual Report on form 10-K. See note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nThe Company relies upon a combination of non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements, as well as common law trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect its proprietary rights.

    "item_7": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial position and results of operations for the year ended June 30, 2021. It should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA few of our highlights for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 were:\n\u25cf SCI Lease Corp, our first North American Ascent\u2122 customer, successfully went live with NFS Ascent\u00ae.\n\u25cf Peter Minshall was appointed Executive Vice President for NetSol Technologies Americas.\n\u25cf A leading captive finance company of a notable U.S. based auto manufacturer went live with LeasePak cloud.\n\u25cf NETSOL\u2019s U.S. based mobility startup, OtozTM, launched its digital automotive retail platform for BMW Group Financial Services in the U.S. for its key brand Mini Anywhere. This represents NETSOL\u2019s first retail platform solution in the North American market for Mini dealerships.\n\u25cf Daimler Financial Services went live with NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail Platform on a single code, single instance and involving multi-tenancy setup in Singapore. Daimler also went live with our NSF Ascent\u00ae Retail Platform in Thailand and began the implementation process of our NSF Ascent\u00ae Retail Platform in New Zealand and Australia.\n\u25cf We entered into an agreement with an existing tier one finance company in China for them to upgrade to our NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail and Wholesale platforms. The contract is expected to generate approximately $9,000,000 during the contract term.\n\u25cf A Captive auto finance company of a leading German Auto manufacturer based in China went successfully live with our NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail Platform.\n\u25cf NETSOL and WRLD3D introduced NXT - a smart workplace platform to support companies to return to work safely.\n\u25cf A rapidly growing U.K. bank serving small and medium-sized enterprises has successfully gone live with the NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail Platform. This is our first go live of an NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail client in the U.K.\n\u25cf We entered into an agreement with a renowned financial services company in the U.S. to implement LeasePak, one of our legacy solutions. The contract is expected to generate approximately $1,000,000 over the life of the contract.\n\u25cf The leasing division of a mid-sized regional bank in the U.S. went live with the SaaS version of our LeasePak solution.\n\u25cf We started the NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail implementation process for the subsidiary of a leading German Auto Manufacturer based in South Korea.\n\u25cf We signed an agreement with Motorcycle Group \u201cMotolease\u201d to deploy our cloud-based version of our NFS Ascent\u00ae platform. This agreement is the first official sale for NFS Ascent\u00ae in the U.S. market.\n\u25cf We generated approximately $2,100,000 of license revenue with the renewal of our NFS CAP and CMS legacy solutions with an existing customer in Thailand.\n\u25cf We generated approximately $1,400,000 of license revenue from an existing customer due to the increase in contracts being serviced on their system.\n\u25cf We effectively executed the share buyback plan with the purchase of 669,018 shares during the 2021 Fiscal Year.\nMarketing and Business Development Activities\nManagement has developed a growth strategy aimed at increasing competitiveness, enhancing global delivery capabilities and increasing financial strength to become a leading global IT institution in the leasing and finance space.\nThe growth strategy contemplates the following enhanced activities and initiatives to accomplish these goals:\n\u25cf Build strong C-level executive professional teams in each key location to execute our long-term strategy.\n\u25cf Develop, groom and retain the next tier level management for leadership to navigate long term growth.\n\u25cf Upgraded Bangkok and Beijing offices to support the growing and existing client relationships and new client acquisitions in the region.\n\u25cf Strengthen the NETSOL brand in the Americas and Europe and further penetrate the APAC markets such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\n\u25cf Maintain the quality of our delivery, after delivery support, and client relationships.\n\u25cf Further penetration of NFS Ascent\u00ae into the leasing and financing sectors in China, APAC, Europe and North America by focusing on multi-national auto captive Fortune 500 companies.\n\u25cf Pursue a well thought out strategy to diversify into complimentary verticals by way of organic expansion, partnerships and synergistic M&A.\n\u25cf Continue to implement new tools, systems and processes, such as JIRA, and the Agile framework to further enhance productivity, efficiencies and operating margins.\n\u25cf Offer a cloud enabled NFS Ascent\u00ae at subscription-based pricing models to generate additional interest from prospects.\n\u25cf Continue investing in OtozTM and our innovation lab to generate new verticals for the business.\nGrowth Prospects for NFS Ascent\u00ae\nGrowth prospects for NFS Ascent\u00ae are linked to the maturing of the product portfolio and its growing customer base across different geographic and product markets. We are eyeing key international markets for growth in sales. Our sales strategy now carefully balances expansion into new geographic markets, including the Americas, Europe, and further penetration of our leading position in Asia Pacific.\nGrowth in North America is expected to come from the potential market for replacement of legacy systems. NFS Ascent\u00ae is aimed at providing a highly flexible and robust solution based on the latest technology and advanced architecture for the North American customers looking to replace their legacy systems. We believe that NFS Ascent\u00ae can provide substantial competitive disruption to the market\u2019s lagging technology provided by incumbent vendors. The existing customer base may also represent latent demand for increased service and maintenance revenues by offering business process optimization, customization and upgrade services.\nGrowth in Europe will come from the introduction of NFS Ascent\u00ae, which will allow NTE to support larger organizations than those typically selecting the existing LeaseSoft product set, and opens the door for European expansion. This is designed to attract larger license and professional services revenues across a wider geography. In addition, leveraging the core strengths of NFS Ascent\u00ae will increasingly provide opportunities in the automotive sector where NTE is currently underrepresented.\nGrowth in our traditionally strong base in Asia Pacific is expected through diversification across market segments to include new customers in related banking and commercial lending areas. At the same time, the existing customer base is tapped for increased service and maintenance revenues by offering enhanced features and new solutions to emerging customer needs. In addition, there is a potential for NFS Ascent\u00ae in Asia Pacific in the form of existing customers who are looking for replacement of their current system.\nIn China, we are a de facto leader in the leasing and finance enterprise solution domain. With this position, we continue to enjoy demand for the current NFS\u2122 solution, as well as NFS Ascent\u00ae. We will continue strengthening our position within existing multinational auto manufacturers, as well as, local Chinese captive finance and leasing companies. The Chinese auto leasing market is young and low on consumer penetration in comparison with the giant U.S. market.\nIn Thailand, we established a sales headquarters, client service center, as well as a headquarters for OtozTM. The NetSol Thai operation is the hub for our global markets and directly supports all APAC markets including China, Indonesia and Australia. Our operation in Bangkok serves a very robust and growing market for leasing companies and regional banks.\nMATERIAL TRENDS AFFECTING NETSOL\nManagement has identified the following material trends affecting NetSol.\nPositive trends:\n\u25cf NFS Ascent\u00ae SaaS offering is gaining traction in mid-size auto captives in North American and European markets.\n\u25cf Mobility and digital transformation is the new norm showing acceleration in every sector particularly in auto and banking.\n\u25cf On Cloud demand for our solution is on the rise.\n\u25cf COVID-19 has created new dynamics for businesses and corporations with employees and executives working from home. Essentially, the decreased office and maintenance costs, as well as the sharply reduced travel expenses, should positively impact our financials.\n\u25cf COVID-19 is creating new opportunities for our R&D teams to expand and monetize mobile and digital solutions in our space and complementary sectors.\n\u25cf In developing markets, new interests are emerging from existing clients for upgrades and mobility platforms.\n\u25cf Growing opportunities and dynamics of shared car ownership either through ride hailing and car sharing encouraging our innovation and development tools.\n\u25cf OtozTM platform is showing positive trajectory of interest from existing and new auto leasing and Tier 1 companies in all of our markets, including China, the US and Europe.\n\u25cf Improved stability in US and Pakistan relationship boosting confidence and trade relations.\n\u25cf The China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) investment, initiated by China, has exceeded $62 billion investment from the originally planned $46 billion on Pakistan energy and infrastructure sectors.\n\u25cf China\u2019s auto sector remains strong as our customers are constantly demanding \u2018Change Requests\u2019 or additional services and reflects resilience.\nNegative trends:\n\u25cf The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our future business globally, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are uncertain, including but not limited to the duration, spread and severity of the pandemic, the availability, adoption and efficacy of vaccines, government responses and other actions to mitigate the spread of and to treat COVID-19, and when and to what extent normal business, economic and social activity and conditions resume.\n\u25cf We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic impacts our customers and other partners and their financial conditions, but adverse effects on these parties could also adversely affect us.\n\u25cf Most OEMs and auto sectors are experiencing a major slowdown due to lockdowns and health concerns.\n\u25cf The C-level decision making to acquire new systems or even upgrade will be elongated due to uncertainty of the COVID-19 virus.\n\u25cf Due to travel restrictions caused by COVID-19, it is increasingly difficult to conduct face to face meetings for global clients and new prospects removing the personal connection essential to some decision making.\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected live industry conferences and events, such as those held by the Equipment Leasing and Finance Association (ELFA), reducing leads and market exposure.\n\u25cf Working from the office poses its own risk of virus spread until it vanishes completely.\n\u25cf Political actions, including trade protection and national security policies of the U.S. and Chinese governments, such as tariffs or bans could in the future limit or prevent companies from transacting business with China and aggravate the global business environment.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u2019s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition and multiple element arrangements, intangible assets, software development costs, and goodwill.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u25cf Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u25cf Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u25cf Determination of the transaction price;\n\u25cf Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u25cf Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe Company records the amount of revenue and related costs by considering whether the entity is a principal (gross presentation) or an agent (net presentation) by evaluating the nature of its promise to the customer. Revenue is presented net of sales, value-added and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities.\nThe Company has two primary revenue streams: core revenue and non-core revenue.\nCore Revenue\nThe Company generates its core revenue from the following sources: (1) software licenses, (2) services, which include implementation and consulting services, and (3) subscription and support, which includes post contract support, of its enterprise software solutions for the lease and finance industry. The Company offers its software using the same underlying technology via two models: a traditional on-premises licensing model and a subscription model. The on-premises model involves the sale or license of software on a perpetual basis to customers who take possession of the software and install and maintain the software on their own hardware. Under the subscription delivery model, the Company provides access to its software on a hosted basis as a service and customers generally do not have the contractual right to take possession of the software.\nNon-Core Revenue\nThe Company generates its non-core revenue by providing business process outsourcing (\u201cBPO\u201d), other IT services and internet services.\nPerformance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account under Topic 606. The transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the promised good or service to the customer. The Company identifies and tracks the performance obligations at contract inception so that the Company can monitor and account for the performance obligations over the life of the contract.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts which contain multiple performance obligations generally consist of the initial purchase of subscription or licenses and a professional services engagement. License purchases generally have multiple performance obligations as customers purchase post contract support and services in addition to the licenses. The Company\u2019s single performance obligation arrangements are typically post contract support renewals, subscription renewals and services engagements.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations where the contracted price differs from the standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) for any distinct good or service, the Company may be required to allocate the contract\u2019s transaction price to each performance obligation using its best estimate for the SSP.\nSubscription\nSubscription revenue is recognized ratably over the initial subscription period committed to by the customer commencing when the product is made available to the customer. The initial subscription period is typically 12 to 60 months. The Company generally invoices its customers in advance in quarterly or annual installments and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.\nSoftware Licenses\nTransfer of control for software is considered to have occurred upon delivery of the product to the customer. The Company\u2019s typical payment terms tend to vary by region, but its standard payment terms are within 30 days of invoice.\nPost Contract Support\nRevenue from support services and product updates, referred to as subscription and support revenue, is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period, which in most instances is one year. Software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product updates, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period on a when-and-if available basis. The Company\u2019s customers purchase both product support and license updates when they acquire new software licenses. In addition, a majority of customers renew their support services contracts annually and typical payment terms provide that customers make payment within 30 days of invoice.\nProfessional Services\nRevenue from professional services is typically comprised of implementation, development, data migration, training or other consulting services. Consulting services are generally sold on a time-and-materials or fixed fee basis and can include services ranging from software installation to data conversion and building non-complex interfaces to allow the software to operate in integrated environments. The Company recognizes revenue for time-and-materials arrangements as the services are performed. In fixed fee arrangements, revenue is recognized as services are performed as measured by costs incurred to date, compared to total estimated costs to complete the services project. Management applies judgment when estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete the services projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes. Services are generally invoiced upon milestones in the contract or upon consumption of the hourly resources and payments are typically due 30 days after invoice.\nBPO and Internet Services\nRevenue from BPO services is recognized based on the stage of completion which is measured by reference to labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for each contract. Internet services are invoiced either monthly, quarterly or half yearly in advance to the customers and revenue is recognized ratably overtime on a monthly basis.\nSignificant Judgments\nMore judgments and estimates are required under Topic 606 than were required under Topic 605. Due to the complexity of certain contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under Topic 606 for the Company\u2019s arrangements may be dependent on contract-specific terms and may vary in some instances.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The Company rarely licenses or sells products on a stand-alone basis, so the Company is required to estimate the range of SSPs for each performance obligation. In instances where SSP is not directly observable because the Company does not sell the license, product or service separately, the Company determines the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In making these judgments, the Company analyzes various factors, including its pricing methodology and consistency, size of the arrangement, length of term, customer demographics and overall market and economic conditions. Based on these results, the estimated SSP is set for each distinct product or service delivered to customers.\nThe most significant inputs involved in the Company\u2019s revenue recognition policies are: The (1) stand-alone selling prices of the Company\u2019s software license, and (2) the method of recognizing revenue for installation/customization, and other services.\nThe stand-alone selling price of the licenses was measured primarily through an analysis of pricing that management evaluated when quoting prices to customers. Although the Company has no history of selling its software separately from post contract support and other services, the Company does have historical experience with amending contracts with customers to provide additional modules of its software or providing those modules at an optional price. This information guides the Company in assessing the stand-alone selling price of the Company\u2019s software, since the Company can observe instances where a customer had a particular component of the Company\u2019s software that was essentially priced separate from other goods and services that the Company delivered to that customer.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from implementation and customization services using the percentage of estimated \u201cman-days\u201d that the work requires. The Company believes the level of effort to complete the services is best measured by the amount of time (measured as an employee working for one day on implementation/customization work) that is required to complete the implementation or customization work. The Company reviews its estimate of man-days required to complete implementation and customization services each reporting period.\nRevenue is recognized over time for the Company\u2019s subscription, post contract support and fixed fee professional services that are separate performance obligations. For the Company\u2019s professional services, revenue is recognized over time, generally using costs incurred or hours expended to measure progress. Judgment is required in estimating project status and the costs necessary to complete projects. A number of internal and external factors can affect these estimates, including labor rates, utilization, specification variances and testing requirement changes.\nIf a group of agreements are entered at or near the same time and so closely related that they are, in effect, part of a single arrangement, such agreements are deemed to be combined as one arrangement for revenue recognition purposes. The Company exercises significant judgment to evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether agreements should be accounted for separately or as a single arrangement. The Company\u2019s judgments about whether a group of contracts comprise a single arrangement can affect the allocation of consideration to the distinct performance obligations, which could have an effect on results of operations for the periods involved.\nIf a contract includes variable consideration, the Company exercises judgment in estimating the amount of consideration to which the entity will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. When estimating variable consideration, the Company will consider all relevant facts and circumstances. Variable consideration will be estimated and included in the contract price only when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers and these timing differences result in receivables, contract assets (revenues in excess of billings), or contract liabilities (deferred revenue) on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company records revenues in excess of billings when the Company has transferred goods or services but does not yet have the right to consideration. The Company records deferred revenue when the Company has received or has the right to receive consideration but has not yet transferred goods or services to the customer.\nUnearned Revenue\nThe Company typically invoices its customers for subscription and support fees in advance on a quarterly or annual basis, with payment due at the start of the subscription or support term. Unpaid invoice amounts for non-cancellable license and services starting in future periods are included in accounts receivable and unearned revenue.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions\nThere are several practical expedients and exemptions allowed under Topic 606 that impact timing of revenue recognition and the Company\u2019s disclosures. The Company has applied the following practical expedients:\n\u25cf The Company does not evaluate a contract for a significant financing component if payment is expected within one year or less from the transfer of the promised items to the customer.\n\u25cf The Company generally expenses sales commissions and sales agent fees when incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less or the commissions are based on cashed received. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\u25cf The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed (applies to time-and-material engagements).\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nThe Company does not have a material amount of costs to obtain a contract capitalized at any balance sheet date. In general, we incur few direct incremental costs of obtaining new customer contracts. We rarely incur incremental costs to review or otherwise enter into contractual arrangements with customers. In addition, our sales personnel receive fees that we refer to as commissions, but that are based on more than simply signing up new customers. Our sales personnel are required to perform additional duties beyond new customer contract inception dates, including fulfillment duties and collections efforts.\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\nIntangible assets consist of product licenses, renewals, enhancements, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, and customer lists. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life and are evaluated for impairment at least on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.\nSOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS\nCosts incurred to internally develop computer software products or to enhance an existing product are recorded as research and development costs and expensed when incurred until technological feasibility for the respective product is established. Thereafter, all software development costs are capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalization ceases when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers.\nThe Company makes on-going evaluations of the recoverability of its capitalized software projects by comparing the amount capitalized for each product to the estimated net realizable value of the product. If such evaluations indicate that the unamortized software development costs exceed the net realizable value, the Company writes off the amount which the unamortized software development costs exceed net realizable value. Capitalized and purchased computer software development costs are being amortized ratably based on the projected revenue associated with the related software or on a straight-line basis.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nOur stock-based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the award\u2019s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and expected term. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model changes significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and our expectations regarding future pre-vesting termination behavior of employees. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate; stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nGOODWILL\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase business combination. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. In conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first reviews qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a quantitative assessment and the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of the reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value, the fair value of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill is calculated and an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement\nSee Note 2 \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2020\nThe following table sets forth the items in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 as a percentage of revenues.\nFor the Years\nEnded June 30,\n% %\nNet Revenues:\nLicense fees $ 6,249,924 11.4 % $ 3,260,891 5.8 %\nSubscription and support 22,173,745 40.4 % 20,254,917 35.9 %\nServices 26,448,171 48.2 % 32,555,690 57.8 %\nServices - related party 48,775 0.1 % 300,821 0.5 %\nTotal net revenues 54,920,615 100.0 % 56,372,319 100.0 %\nCost of revenues:\nSalaries and consultants 20,969,298 38.2 % 18,821,738 33.4 %\nTravel 663,403 1.2 % 4,181,742 7.4 %\nDepreciation and amortization 2,990,689 5.4 % 2,897,371 5.1 %\nOther 3,944,197 7.2 % 3,508,098 6.2 %\nTotal cost of revenues 28,567,587 52.0 % 29,408,949 52.2 %\nGross profit 26,353,028 48.0 % 26,963,370 47.8 %\nOperating expenses:\nSelling and marketing 6,555,004 11.9 % 6,450,663 11.4 %\nDepreciation and amortization 965,625 1.8 % 834,583 1.5 %\nGeneral and administrative 15,437,382 28.1 % 17,138,832 30.4 %\nResearch and development cost 674,168 1.2 % 1,468,954 2.6 %\nTotal operating expenses 23,632,179 43.0 % 25,893,032 45.9 %\nIncome from operations 2,720,849 5.0 % 1,070,338 1.9 %\nOther income and (expenses)\nGain (loss) on sale of assets (191,935 ) -0.3 % 23,103 0.0 %\nInterest expense (394,289 ) -0.7 % (346,856 ) -0.6 %\nInterest income 1,017,432 1.9 % 1,569,536 2.8 %\nGain (loss) on foreign currency exchange transactions (597,433 ) -1.1 % 398,610 0.7 %\nShare of net loss from equity investment (253,819 ) -0.5 % (605,864 ) -1.1 %\nOther income 987,444 1.8 % 224,224 0.4 %\nTotal other income (expenses) 567,400 1.0 % 1,262,753 2.2 %\nNet income before income taxes 3,288,249 6.0 % 2,333,091 4.1 %\nIncome tax provision (1,026,617 ) -1.9 % (1,141,068 ) -2.0 %\nNet income 2,261,632 4.1 % 1,192,023 2.1 %\nNon-controlling interest (483,375 ) -0.9 % (254,942 ) -0.5 %\nNet income attributable to NetSol $ 1,778,257 3.2 % $ 937,081 1.7 %\nA significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We operate in several geographical regions as described in Note 21 \u201cSegment Information and Geographic Areas\u201d within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Weakening of the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of increasing our revenues but also increasing our expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Similarly, strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of reducing our revenues but also reducing our expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We plan our business accordingly by deploying additional resources to areas of expansion, while continuing to monitor our overall expenditures given the economic uncertainties of our target markets. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the changes in results from one period to another period using constant currency. In order to calculate our constant currency results, we apply the current period results to the prior period foreign currency exchange rates. In the table below, we present the change based on actual results in reported currency and in constant currency.\nFavorable Favorable Total\n(Unfavorable) (Unfavorable) Favorable\nFor the Years Change in Change due (Unfavorable)\nEnded June 30, Constant to Currency Change as\n% % Currency Fluctuation Reported\nNet Revenues: $ 54,920,615 100.0 % $ 56,372,319 100.0 % $ (2,351,850 ) $ 900,146 $ (1,451,704 )\nCost of revenues: 28,567,587 52.0 % 29,408,949 52.2 % 1,039,764 (198,402 ) 841,362\nGross profit 26,353,028 48.0 % 26,963,370 47.8 % (1,312,086 ) 701,744 (610,342 )\nOperating expenses: 23,632,179 43.0 % 25,893,032 45.9 % 2,298,574 (37,721 ) 2,260,853\nIncome (loss) from operations $ 2,720,849 5.0 % $ 1,070,338 1.9 % $ 986,488 $ 664,023 $ 1,650,511\nNet revenues for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 by segment are as follows:\nRevenue % Revenue %\nNorth America $ 3,724,547 6.8 % $ 4,444,862 7.9 %\nEurope 11,283,499 20.5 % 11,914,071 21.1 %\nAsia-Pacific 39,912,569 72.7 % 40,013,386 71.0 %\nTotal $ 54,920,615 100.0 % $ 56,372,319 100.0 %\nRevenues\nLicense Fees\nLicense fees for the year ended June 30, 2021 were $6,249,924 compared to $3,260,891 for the year ended June 30, 2020 reflecting an increase of $2,989,033 with a change in constant currency of $2,633,782. The increase in license revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to the increase in license revenue recognized for the GAC, TIL and BMW contracts to implement our NFS Ascent\u00ae Retail Platform. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we recorded $2,400,000 of license revenue for the GAC NFS Ascent\u00ae contract, $2,100,000 for the TIL NFS Ascent\u00ae contract, and $1,400,000 for the BMW NFS Ascent\u00ae contract. In fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, we recorded $2,500,000 of license revenue for the DFS, 12 country NFS Ascent\u00ae contract, $470,000 for an NFS Ascent\u00ae contract in the U.K., and $1,540,000 from license revenues through sales of our regional offerings in China, Australia, the U.S. and the U.K.\nSubscription and Support\nSubscription and support fees for the year ended June 30, 2021, were $22,173,745 compared to $20,254,917 for the year ended June 30, 2020 reflecting an increase of $1,918,828 with a change in constant currency of $1,754,369. The increase in subscription and support fees is due to going live with several markets related to the DFS contract and going live with the BMW contract. Subscription and support fees begin once a customer has \u201cgone live\u201d with our product. Subscription and support fees are recurring in nature, and we anticipate these fees to gradually increase as we implement both our NFS legacy products and NFS Ascent\u00ae.\nServices\nServices income for the year ended June 30, 2021, was $26,448,171 compared to $32,555,690 for the year ended June 30, 2020, reflecting a decrease of $6,107,519 with a decrease in constant currency of $6,485,196. The decrease in services revenue is due to the decrease in implementation revenue associated with customers who have gone live with our products. Services revenue is derived from services provided to both current customers as well as services provided to new customers as part of the implementation process.\nServices - Related Party\nServices income from related party for the year ended June 30, 2021 was $48,775 compared to $300,821 for the year ended June 30, 2020 reflecting a decrease of $252,046 with a decrease in constant currency of $254,805. The decrease in related party service revenue is due to a decrease in revenue due to less services performed for WRLD3D.\nGross Profit\nThe gross profit was $26,353,028 for the year ended June 30, 2021 as compared with $26,963,370 for the year ended June 30, 2020. This is a decrease of $610,342 with a decrease in constant currency of $1,312,086. The gross profit percentage for the year ended June 30, 2021 increased to 48.0% from 47.8% for the year ended June 30, 2020. The cost of sales was $28,567,587 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $29,408,949 for the year ended June 30, 2020 for a decrease of $841,362 and on a constant currency basis a decrease of $1,039,764. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased from 52.2% for the year ended June 30, 2020 to 52.0% for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nSalaries and consultant fees increased by $2,147,560 from $18,821,738 for the year ended June 30, 2020 to $20,969,298 for the year ended June 30, 2021 and on a constant currency basis increased by $1,984,188. The increase in salaries is due to the increase in the number of technical employees and the annual increase in salaries and wages. We had 932, 1,009, and 1,036 technical employees as of June 30, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. As a percentage of sales, salaries and consultant expense increased from 33.4% for the year ended June 30, 2020 to 38.2% for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nTravel decreased by $3,518,339 from $4,181,742 for the year ended June 30, 2020 to $663,403 for the year ended June 30, 2021 and on a constant currency basis decreased by $3,558,950. The decrease in travel is due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. As a percentage of sales, travel expense decreased from 7.4% for year ended June 30, 2020 to 1.2% for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $2,990,689 compared to $2,897,371 for the year ended June 30, 2020 or an increase of $93,318 and on a constant currency basis an increase of $123,117.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $23,632,179 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $25,893,032, for the year ended June 30, 2020 for a decrease of 8.7% or $2,260,853 and on a constant currency basis a decrease of 9.0% or $2,298,574. As a percentage of sales, it decreased from 45.9% to 43.0%. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to decreases in general and administrative expenses and research and development cost offset by an increase in selling and marketing expenses, salaries and wages and depreciation expense.\nSelling and marketing expenses increased $104,341 or 1.6% and on a constant currency basis an increase of $42,010 or 0.7%. The increase in selling and marketing expenses is due to increase in our salaries and commissions, and business development costs to market and sell NFS Ascent\u00ae globally.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $15,437,382 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $17,138,832 at June 30, 2020 or a decrease of $1,701,450 or 9.9% and on a constant currency basis a decrease of $1,641,828 or 9.6%. The decrease is primarily due to a reduction of approximately $795,000 related to a withholding tax on dividends and by customers, approximately $395,000 of reduced travel expenses, approximately $56,000 of reduced professional services, approximately $517,000 related to the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts and approximately $157,000 reduction in rent expense offset by an increase in salaries of approximately $402,000.\nResearch and development costs were $674,168 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $1,468,954 at June 30, 2020 or a decrease of $794,786 or 54.1% and on constant currency basis a decrease of $799,928 or 54.5%. The decrease in research and development costs is due to less spending on our innovation initiatives with Blockchain, AI, and IoT.\nIncome/Loss from Operations\nIncome from operations was $2,720,849 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $1,070,338 for the year ended June 30, 2020. This represents an increase of $1,650,511 with an increase of $986,488 on a constant currency basis for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared with the year ended June 30, 2020. As a percentage of sales, income from operations was 5.0% for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to 1.9% for the year ended June 30, 2020.\nOther Income and Expense\nOther income was $567,400 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $1,262,753 for the year ended June 30, 2020. This represents a decrease of $695,353 with a decrease of $893,154 on a constant currency basis. The decrease is primarily due to the interest income and foreign currency exchange transactions. Interest income was $1,017,432 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $1,569,536 for the period ended June 30, 2020. This represent a decrease of $552,104 or a change of $557,829 on constant currency basis. We did not accrue any interest income on the convertible notes receivable for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $372,314 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The majority of the contracts with NetSol PK are either in U.S. dollars or Euros; therefore, the currency fluctuations will lead to foreign currency exchange gains or losses depending on the value of the PKR compared to the U.S. Dollar and the Euro. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we recognized a loss of $597,433 in foreign currency exchange transactions compared to a gain of $398,610 for the year ended June 30, 2020. During the year ended June 30, 2021, the value of the U.S. dollar and the Euro decreased 5.9% and 0.5%, respectively, compared to the PKR. During the year ended June 30, 2020, the value of the U.S. dollar and the Euro increased 3.1% and 1.8%, respectively, compared to the PKR.\nNon-controlling Interest\nFor the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the net income attributable to non-controlling interest was $483,375 and $254,942, respectively. The increase in non-controlling interest is primarily due to the increase in net income of NetSol PK.\nNet Income/Loss Attributable to NetSol\nNet income was $1,778,257 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $937,081 for the year ended June 30, 2020. This is an increase of $841,176 with a decrease of $9,399 on a constant currency basis, compared to the prior year. For the year ended June 30, 2021, net income per share was $0.15 for basic and diluted shares. For the year ended June 30, 2020, net income per share was $0.08 for basic and diluted shares.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), \u201cUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,\u201d defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per basic and diluted share meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe define the non-GAAP measures as follows:\n\u25cf EBITDA is GAAP net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization.\n\u25cf Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense.\n\u25cf Adjusted EBITDA per basic and diluted share - Adjusted EBITDA allocated to common stock divided by the weighted average shares outstanding and diluted shares outstanding.\nWe use non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the business and believe that presenting non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations as well as useful metrics for monitoring our performance and evaluating it against industry peers. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should be used in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure in evaluating the Company.\nThe non-GAAP measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nEBITDA: We report EBITDA as a non-GAAP metric by excluding the effect of net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization from net income because doing so makes internal comparisons to our historical operating results more consistent. In addition, we believe providing an EBITDA calculation is a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating results of our peers.\nStock-based compensation expense: We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expense from the non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA per basic and diluted share calculations. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results because it is not an expense which generally requires cash settlement by NetSol, and therefore is not used by us to assess the profitability of our operations. We also believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating results of our peers.\nNon-controlling interest: We add back the non-controlling interest in calculating gross adjusted EBITDA and then subtract out the income taxes, depreciation and amortization and net interest expense attributable to the non-controlling interest to arrive at a net adjusted EBITDA.\nOur reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share to the most comparable GAAP measures for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nFor the Year Ended For the Year Ended\nJune 30, 2021 June 30, 2020\nNet Income (loss) attributable to NetSol $ 1,778,257 $ 937,081\nNon-controlling interest 483,375 254,942\nIncome taxes 1,026,617 1,141,068\nDepreciation and amortization 3,956,314 3,731,954\nInterest expense 394,289 346,856\nInterest (income) (1,017,432 ) (1,569,536 )\nEBITDA $ 6,621,420 $ 4,842,365\nAdd back:\nNon-cash stock-based compensation 342,153 808,616\nAdjusted EBITDA, gross $ 6,963,573 $ 5,650,981\nLess non-controlling interest (a) (1,588,701 ) (1,330,352 )\nAdjusted EBITDA, net $ 5,374,872 $ 4,320,629\nWeighted Average number of shares outstanding\nBasic 11,499,983 11,734,648\nDiluted 11,499,983 11,784,414\nBasic adjusted EBITDA $ 0.47 $ 0.37\nDiluted adjusted EBITDA $ 0.47 $ 0.37\n(a) The reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA of non-controlling interest to net income attributable to non-controlling interest is as follows\nNet Income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest $ 483,375 $ 254,942\nIncome Taxes 147,688 223,675\nDepreciation and amortization 1,115,734 1,060,605\nInterest expense 121,740 100,373\nInterest (income) (319,674 ) (391,644 )\nEBITDA $ 1,548,863 $ 1,247,951\nAdd back:\nNon-cash stock-based compensation 39,838 82,401\nAdjusted EBITDA of non-controlling interest $ 1,588,701 $ 1,330,352\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur cash position was $33,705,154 at June 30, 2021, compared to $20,166,830 at June 30, 2020.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $15,725,923 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $3,972,426 for the year ended June 30, 2020.

We had revenues in excess of billings of $15,637,734 at June 30, 2021 compared to $18,506,733 at June 30, 2020 of which $957,603 and $1,300,289 are shown as long term as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The long-term portion was discounted by $66,779 and $41,286 at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, using the discounted cash flow method with interest rates ranging from 4.65% to 6.25% and 4.35%, for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2021, our revenues in excess of billings were reclassified to accounts receivable pursuant to billing requirements detailed in each contract. The combined totals for accounts receivable and revenues in excess of billings decreased by $10,099,160 from $29,920,990 at June 30, 2020 to $19,821,830 at June 30, 2021. Accounts payable and accrued expenses, and current portions of loans and lease obligations amounted to $6,696,035 and $11,366,171, respectively at June 30, 2021. The average days sales outstanding for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were 165 and 200 days respectively. The days sales outstanding have been calculated by taking into consideration the average combined balances of accounts receivable and revenue in excess of billings.\nNet cash used by investing activities amounted to $2,518,550 for the year ended June 30, 2021, compared to $2,054,890 for the year ended June 30, 2020. We had net purchases of property and equipment of $2,363,050 compared to $1,270,965 for the comparable period last fiscal year.

For the year ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, we invested $155,500 and $94,500, respectively, in DriveMate.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $1,165,565 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $1,700,293, for the years ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, respectively. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we purchased 669,018 shares of our common stock from the open market for $2,364,781 compared to zero shares of common stock for the year ended June 30, 2020. The year ended June 30, 2021, included cash inflow of $1,898,013 from bank proceeds compared to $4,221,203 for the same period last year. During the year ended June 30, 2021, we had net payments for bank loans and capital leases of $698,797 compared to $611,913 for the year ended June 30, 2020. We are operating in various geographical regions of the world through our various subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries have financial arrangements from various financial institutions to meet both their short and long-term funding requirements. These loans will become due at different maturity dates as described in Note 15 of the financial statements. We are in compliance with the covenants of the financial arrangements and there is no default which may lead to early payment of these obligations. We anticipate paying back all these obligations on their respective due dates.\nWe typically fund the cash requirements for our operations in the U.S. through our license, services, and maintenance agreements, intercompany charges for corporate services, and through the exercise of options. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately $33.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which approximately $31.7 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2020, we have approximately $20.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which approximately $18.2 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries.\nWe remain open to strategic relationships that would provide value added benefits. The focus will remain on continuously improving cash reserves internally and reduced reliance on external capital raise.\nAs a growing company, we have on-going capital expenditure needs based on our short term and long-term business plans. Although our requirements for capital expenses vary from time to time, for the next 12 months, we anticipate needing working capital of $2 to $3 million for APAC, U.S. and European new business development activities and infrastructure enhancements.\nWhile there is no guarantee that any of these methods will result in raising sufficient funds to meet our capital needs or that even if available will be on terms acceptable to us, we will be very cautious and prudent about any new capital raise given the global market uncertainties. However, we are very conscious of the dilutive effect and price pressures in raising equity-based capital.\nFinancial Covenants\nOur UK based subsidiary, NTE, has an approved overdraft facility of \u00a3300,000 ($416,667) which requires that the aggregate amount of invoiced trade debtors (net of provisions for bad and doubtful debts and excluding intra-group debtors) of NTE, not exceeding 90 days old, will not be less than an amount equal to 200% of the facility. The Pakistani subsidiary, NetSol PK has an approved facility for export refinance from Askari Bank Limited amounting to Rupees 500 million ($3,162,555) and a running finance facility of Rupees 75 million ($474,383).

These facilities require NetSol PK to maintain a long-term debt equity ratio of 60:40 and the current ratio of 1:1. NetSol PK also has an approved export refinance facility of Rs. 380 million ($2,403,542) and a running finance facility of Rs. 120 million ($759,013) from Samba Bank Limited. During the tenure of loan, these two facilities require NetSol PK to maintain at a minimum a current ratio of 1:1, an interest coverage ratio of 4 times, a leverage ratio of 2 times, and a debt service coverage ratio of 4 times.\nAs of the date of this report, we are in compliance with the financial covenants associated with our borrowings. The maturity dates of the borrowings of respective subsidiaries may accelerate if they do not comply with these covenants. In case of any change in control in subsidiaries, they may have to repay their respective credit facilities.\nDividends and Redemption\nIt has been our policy to invest earnings in growth rather than distribute earnings as common stock dividends. This policy, under which common stock dividends have not been paid since our inception is expected to continue but is subject to regular review by the Board of Directors.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations are as follows:\nPayment due by period\nContractual Obligation Total 0 - 1 year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 years\nDebt Obligations\nD&O Insurance $ 73,143 $ 73,143 $ - $ - $ -\nTerm Finance Facility 1,648,818 1,090,259 558,559\n-\nLoan Payable Bank - Export Refinance 3,162,555 3,162,555 - - -\nLoan Payable Bank - Export Refinance II 2,403,542 2,403,542 - - -\nLoan Payable Bank - Export Refinance III 4,427,578 4,427,578 - - -\nTerm Finance Facility 55,182 19,644 35,538 - -\nSale and Leaseback Financing 85,313 28,183 57,130 - -\nInsurance financing 41,774 41,774 - - -\nSubsidiary Finance Leases 168,107 119,493 48,614 - -\nOperating Lease Obligations 1,421,986 867,279 550,736 1,589 2,382\nTotal $ 13,487,998 $ 12,233,450 $ 1,250,577 $ 1,589 $ 2,382\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not maintain any off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.",

    "item_1": "Item 1.\nBusiness.\nOverview\nBsquare is a software and services company that designs, configures, and deploys technologies that solve difficult problems for manufacturers and operators of connected devices. Our customers choose Bsquare to help realize the promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) to transform their businesses. Our products include software that connect devices to create intelligent systems that are cloud-enabled, contribute critical data, and facilitate distributed control and decision making. Our services include 24/7 IoT operations that allow our customers to focus on their businesses while we take care of security, monitoring, and general technology updates. The opportunity to help companies explore and capture the value of IoT is attractive and growing. In the last two years alone, we helped hundreds of companies deploy and manage over two million devices. We operate large IoT systems for our customers with device fleets that range in size and complexity. We believe we offer a unique combination of expertise in device-level solutions, embedded operating systems, and IoT services and software that is valued by a global customer base, from start-ups to Fortune 100 companies, across a diverse set of industries.\nSince our founding in 1994, Bsquare has been at the intersection of hardware and software. Today, that intersection is the \u201cedge\u201d where cloud-enabled devices connect to create intelligent systems, creating new demands for software, deployment, and operations. Bsquare is meeting those demands, making intelligent systems possible. We believe our technology is making people more productive, improving quality of life, and reducing demands on the resources of our planet.\nEmbedded Operating System Software and Services\nCustomers engage us because of our technical expertise in device operating system (\u201cOS\u201d) image development and configuration, device software development and testing, and our experience in embedded and mobile systems design. Our long and successful history as a Microsoft Corporation (\u201cMicrosoft\u201d) embedded OS distribution and technology partner is a source of many customer opportunities and a pillar of our reputation in the IoT ecosystem. We believe working with Bsquare engineers can result in shorter development cycles, faster time-to-market, lower overall development costs, and a more robust product. Our software and configuration services are designed to help ensure that our customers\u2019 devices are secure, updateable, and operable as part of a connected IoT system. A decade ago, our customers typically built devices on a single OS. Today, they increasingly have a multi-OS product strategy. Accordingly, we believe that the need for our embedded OS expertise and services is expanding and accelerating. We recognize revenue and cost of sales for this segment of our business under the name \u201cPartner Solutions\u201d.\nEmbedded OS Market\nOur target market for OS software and services includes makers of connected, intelligent devices such as point-of-sale terminals, kiosks, tablets and handheld data collection devices, smart vending machines, ATMs, essential equipment in buildings and facilities environments, digital signs, and in-vehicle telematics and entertainment devices. These devices work on a variety of operating systems, including the most common: Windows IoT, Android, and Linux. They are deployed in various cloud environments, such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), or Google Cloud, and are typically connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection. Our customers for these smart devices include world-class original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d), original design manufacturers (\u201cODMs\u201d), silicon vendors, and peripheral vendors.\nIoT Software and 24/7 Operations Services\nOur customers\u2019 devices are frequently components of complicated operating networks, creating new requirements for updating, maintaining and evolving the capabilities of devices in the fleet. Once configured and deployed, this device fleet then becomes part of an operational environment that requires long-term attention to the myriad challenges of IoT operations. In short, devices can no longer simply be sold, installed, and then forgotten. These demands have created operational burdens that are challenging to meet through traditional technologies and support models. For that reason, our customers are increasingly relying on Bsquare\u2019s extensive experience developing, deploying, and operating large IoT systems at scale. Our experience using Microsoft Azure and AWS cloud services is an asset we believe to be seldom found inside a customer\u2019s technology team. We believe outsourcing fleet management and 24/7 operations services to Bsquare can result in lower system development costs, greater security, better maintainability, lower operating costs, and improved return on investment (\u201cROI\u201d) for a customer\u2019s IoT system. We have built and now operate 24/7 mission critical IoT systems for customers of varying size and complexity, and we believe the software and processes we have used to achieve this success may be a sustainable competitive advantage and a potential opportunity for new revenue. We recognize revenue and cost of sales for this segment of our business under the name \u201cEdge to Cloud\u201d.\nIoT Software and Services Market\nOur target market for our IoT software and services includes our OS and software OEM customers as well as companies that purchase from those OEMs and operate their devices as a fleet. This market represents business and industrial segments in a wide range of vertical markets such as retail, point of sale, medical equipment, gaming, buildings and facilities management, manufacturing, robotics, autonomous vehicles, utility management, and transportation. The IoT market continues to evolve as companies understand the possibilities and economics of IoT technology and operations. Increasingly, customers are realizing that IoT operations are not core competencies of their business and that outsourcing operations can lower costs, reduce downtime, and mitigate the reputational risk of security and operational failures.\nBsquare Solutions Suite\nWe provide a suite of software, tools, and services to our customers that are packaged based on technical and business requirements that includes:\nEmbedded OS and System Software Sales and Support\nBsquare resells Windows IoT, Windows Embedded, and Windows Server IoT software as well as system utility software for Adobe and McAfee. We provide license compliance services, technical support, and manufacturing support.\nOS Configuration Services\nWe consult with customers to create a manufacturable image for a specific version of OS software (Windows IoT, Linux, and Android) based on the unique requirements of the hardware and the intended operating environment. Our software and services are designed to help ensure the system is secure, recoverable, maintainable, upgradable, and operable as part of an intelligent system.\nFleet Transition Services\nOur software tools and professional services help transition a collection of devices to a specific OS and software configuration in preparation for management and operations as part of an intelligent system. We work with companies to understand and bring together multiple versions of OS software and hardware, connectivity, security, personnel, operating hours, and other factors that could affect previously deployed equipment.\nIoT Transition\nBsquare offers software utilities and professional services to migrate a fleet of devices to 24/7 IoT operations, allowing individual device and system performance to be managed centrally and integrated into existing business systems.\n24/7 IoT Operations\nOur outsourced IoT operations services include 24/7 infrastructure monitoring, automated issue escalation, incident response and troubleshooting, management protocols, uptime and service level reporting, and cloud instance management.\nData Engineering\nWe offer services to assist customers with the development and implementation of IoT systems and data-driven operations, including machine learning and predictive analytics that allow IoT systems to operate as an intelligent system.\nSoftware Distribution\nWe maintain distribution agreements with multiple third-party software vendors. Our ability to resell these third-party software products, whether as stand-alone products or in conjunction with our own proprietary software and engineering service offerings, provides our customers with a comprehensive solution for their device project needs:\n\u25cf\nFor over 20 years, we have been a Microsoft Authorized Distributor of Windows Embedded and IoT operating system software and licenses, including major product families such as Windows 10 IoT Enterprise, Windows Server IoT, and SQL Server IoT. We are also authorized to sell Windows IoT operating systems in Canada, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Columbia, and several Caribbean countries.\n\u25cf\nWe are an authorized distributor for Adobe Flash technologies and Adobe Reader. We have the right to distribute Adobe Flash Lite licenses on a worldwide basis.\n\u25cf\nWe are an authorized distributor of McAfee security software in North America.\nThe majority of our revenue continues to be derived from reselling Microsoft Windows Embedded and IoT operating system software to device makers. The sale of Microsoft operating systems has historically accounted for substantially all of our Partner Solutions revenue.\nRelationship with Microsoft\nWe have a long-standing relationship with Microsoft, which is important to the continuing success of our business:\n\u25cf\nWe have been one of Microsoft\u2019s distributors of Windows Embedded and IoT operating systems for over 20 years.\n\u25cf\nWe have been a distributor of Microsoft Windows Mobile operating systems since November 2009.\n\u25cf\nWe are a Gold level Data Analytics partner.\n\u25cf\nWe are a Gold level Application Integration partner.\n\u25cf\nWe are Silver level Application Development partner.\n\u25cf\nMicrosoft has engaged us on various engineering service projects.\n\u25cf\nWe work closely with Microsoft executives, developers, product managers and sales personnel. We leverage these relationships in a variety of ways, including:\na.\nWe gain early access to new Microsoft embedded software and other technologies.\nb.\nWe leverage co-marketing resources, content and strategies from Microsoft, including market development funds, to support our own marketing and sales efforts.\nc.\nWe participate in Microsoft-sponsored trade shows, seminars, and other events.\nd.\nWe receive sales leads from Microsoft.\ne.\nWe receive rebates from Microsoft based upon the achievement of predefined sales objectives.\nSee Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d for more information regarding our relationship with Microsoft.\nCompetition\nMicrosoft controls who can distribute its OS software. Microsoft Authorized Distributors that we compete with include Advantech, Inc., Arrow Electronics, Inc., Avnet, Inc., and Dell Computer, Inc. Our competition is not limited to these Microsoft Authorized Distributors. We compete with other consulting firms for services related to device design and development, system software development, and engineering firms that offer similar services.\nCompetition for our IoT software and operating services include:\n\u25cf\nLarge, established enterprise software and solution providers such as International Business Machines, Oracle Corporation, SAP SE, and SAS Software, Inc.\n\u25cf\nCloud IoT providers such as AWS and Microsoft Azure. Although we are closely partnered with AWS and Microsoft, there are elements of their solutions with which we compete directly.\n\u25cf\nMid-sized companies engaged in business transitions similar to our own, including PTC Inc. and TTTech Industrial North America, Inc.\n\u25cf\nStartups funded to enter the IoT market, including C3.AI, Inc., Losant IOT Inc., and TeamViewer US, Inc.\nThe market for device software and engineering services is competitive and we face competition from the following:\n\u25cf\nOur current and potential customers\u2019 internal engineering and research and development departments, which may seek to provide their own IoT-related services or develop their own software solutions which could compete with our own service offerings and products.\n\u25cf\nEngineering service firms, including offshore development companies, such as Adeneo, Symphony Teleca, and Wipro.\n\u25cf\nODMs, particularly those in Taiwan and China, with their own software development capabilities.\n\u25cf\nContract manufacturers with their own software development capabilities.\nSome of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. They may also focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products that can be integrated with our products. As we develop and bring to market new software and service offerings, we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed. Further, as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our services and software solutions, or increase our penetration therein, we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed. It is also likely that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances, including alliances with AWS or Microsoft, that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share. New competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the connected device market, and as new products and technologies are introduced.\nNeither AWS nor Microsoft has agreed to an exclusive arrangement with us, nor has either agreed not to compete against us. AWS may decide to focus on providing products or services that compete directly with our products and services or partner with other solution providers that compete with us. Microsoft may decide to bring in-house more of the core-embedded development services and expertise that we currently provide, possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us. The barrier to entering the market as a provider of Microsoft-based smart connected systems software and services is relatively low. In addition, Microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on Windows operating system software and services, including in the evolving IoT market. These systems integrators may be given substantially the same access by Microsoft to Microsoft technology as we are.\nSales and Marketing\nWe market our products and professional engineering services utilizing a direct sales model. We have sales personnel in the United States and in the United Kingdom. Historically, we have not made significant use of resellers, channel partners, representative agents or other indirect channels. Key elements of our sales and marketing strategy include direct marketing, digital marketing, content marketing, trade shows, event marketing, public relations, analyst relations, social media properties, customer and strategic alliance partner co-marketing programs, and a comprehensive website.\nOur sales and marketing efforts with embedded OS customers will also be beneficial in our efforts to attract customers for our IoT software and services, and vice versa. The two markets we have traditionally served are converging, and our sales and marketing will increasingly reflect that convergence. The cross-selling opportunities between our two primarily markets could be a source of strength as we continue to expand our presence and reputation among the makers of IoT devices and those responsible for IoT device operations.\nInternational Operations\nOur international operations outside of North America are conducted through our offices in Trowbridge, UK. We maintain a European sales and marketing presence through the UK office exclusively in support of our IoT software and services, reported in our Edge to Cloud business segment. The majority of our global technical personnel also work from the UK office. In the first quarter of 2020 we ceased operations in Taipei, Taiwan.\nOur OEM Distribution Agreement with Microsoft for the sale of Microsoft Windows IoT operating systems is currently restricted to North America. As a result, the majority of our revenue continues to be generated from North America. Revenue generated from customers located outside of North America was approximately 14% and 15% of total revenue in 2020 and 2019 respectively.\nHuman Capital\nWe had total headcount of 70 on December 31, 2020, with 38 people located in North America and 32 in the United Kingdom. Of the 70 people currently working at the company, 16 are contractors working less than full time on an as-needed basis, with the other 54 team members comprised of full time or near full-time employees. As compared to December 31, 2019, our headcount was smaller by five, primarily as a result of our efforts throughout 2020 to re-align our organization around a sustainable cost structure.\nIn addition to the personnel cost reductions pursued in 2020, we shifted some professional engineering service employees from traditional consulting engagements to product development activities. As we identify new product opportunities and take new product offerings to market, we may continue to shift engineering personnel to perform research and development activities. We may also occasionally shift personnel back to consulting project work, as needed.\nIn mid-March 2020, in response to local government \u201cstay at home,\u201d \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and similar orders intended to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, we closed our offices in Trowbridge in the United Kingdom and stopped all non-essential activities in our Bellevue, Washington office. Bsquare\u2019s operations are, at the time of this filing, fully virtual.\nIn January of 2020, we started planning for the end of our Bellevue office lease. We reviewed how and where we work and collaborate, commuting patterns, costs, and our space requirements. With our engineering team in the UK and customers all over the globe, collaborating over long distances and time zones was an operating imperative. We purchased and deployed technologies that enabled and enhanced remote work and had asked our team members to begin to consider how they could begin to work more often from remote locations. This planning work allowed us to move seamlessly to virtual operations when the time came.\nIn June of 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, we moved our corporate headquarters from Bellevue, Washington, to Seattle, Washington. From the outset, we conceived of our new location as a collaboration space and we refer to it as the \u201cSeattle Collaboration Space\u201d or the \u201cSCS\u201d, rather than as a traditional office. While the new facility has remained largely unoccupied, we believe it will serve us well and we look forward to hosting visitors when it is safe again.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nIn 2020, we formed a company-wide Anti-racism Task Force to help us reckon with the ways in which our company and the technology industry at large have contributed to systemic racism in both the US and the UK. In this area, we favor action over performative speech. We are expanding our recruiting outreach to find candidates from communities currently underrepresented in technology companies and are renewing our commitment to inclusive hiring practices. We are particularly interested in building a team composed of people who have made diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace a central part of their professional journey. We are also holding our partners accountable to their own actions in pursuit of racial equity, and we are offering every employee a day of Civil Engagement Leave to vote, volunteer in their community, or participate in other civic activities.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe strive to provide market-competitive compensation and benefits that attract and retain employees who values align with our mission and goals. Our compensation packages include combinations of competitive base pay, sales commissions, performance based short-term incentives, health care, retirement benefits, paid time off and family leave. In addition, we offer employees the benefit of equity ownership in the Company through stock option grants.

    "item_7": "Item 7.\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. This Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations may contain some statements and information that are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements. For a discussion of these forward-looking statements, and of important factors that could cause results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this report, see Item 1 of Part I, \u201cBusiness-Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and Item 1A of Part I, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nBsquare is a software and services company that designs, configures, and deploys technologies that solve difficult problems for manufacturers and operators of connected devices. Our customers choose Bsquare to help realize the promise of IoT to transform their businesses. Our products include software that connect devices to create intelligent systems that are cloud-enabled, contribute critical data, and facilitate distributed control and decision making. Our services include 24/7 IoT operations that allow our customers to focus on their businesses while we take care of security, monitoring, and general technology updates. The opportunity to help companies explore and capture the value of IoT is attractive and growing. In the last two years alone, we helped hundreds of companies deploy and manage over two million devices. We operate large IoT systems for our customers with device fleets that range in size and complexity. We believe we offer a unique combination of expertise in device-level solutions, embedded operating systems, and IoT services and software that is valued by a global customer base, from start-ups to Fortune 100 companies, across a diverse set of industries.\nIn 2020, we continued our initiatives commenced in 2019 to reposition our business. We believe the additional focus we placed on serving our customers contributed to the financial and operating results of 2020.\nRevenue and Customers\nThe COVID-19 pandemic interrupted our customer ordering patterns, causing a significant disruption to our Partner Solutions business in 2020. After an exceptionally strong revenue in the first quarter, we saw a significant decrease in Partner Solution revenue in the second quarter. Partner Solutions revenue improved and stabilized in the third and fourth quarters, but at levels lower than our pre-COVID-19 expectations. We suspect our Partner Solutions revenue also decreased because competing Microsoft distributors offered deep discounts on Windows IoT OS software as part of hardware / software bundles. We expect this will continue in 2021. We are working aggressively to retain our large customers and attract new customers with superior service and technical support, pricing that rewards loyalty, and a path to IoT operations.\nInvestments made to ensure we were meeting our operating commitments, while re-tooling and addressing issues with software previously delivered to some of our larger IoT customers, started to pay off in 2020. We expanded our relationship with Itron, Inc. (\u201cItron\u201d) and our work helping them build their intelligent utility grid. We anticipate investments in our other large IoT customers will continue in 2021, but at lower levels than in 2020 as the bulk of the rework is now complete. Beyond gaining credibility as a reliable technology partner, we believe the experience we have gained serving Itron and our other large IoT customers positions us to improve our IoT software and services in 2021 and beyond.\nExpenses and Operating Results\nDespite the disruption of COVID-19, we had one of our strongest years in recent history. 2020 operating loss and net loss improved dramatically over 2019, by $7.5 million and $7.3 million respectively. These strong results became possible through prior efforts to enter 2020 with an expense structure that made sense for our business and an entrepreneurial leadership team that acted on changing business circumstances and opportunities as they emerged. We believe this operating discipline demonstrates our ability to manage through adversity.\nCash and Liquidity\nOur cash and cash equivalents increased by $2.4 million during 2020. Our access to loan proceeds from the $1.6 million PPP loan supported our efforts to maintain our engineering staffing levels and pursue new opportunities created by our unique expertise. Our current cash balance and lack of debt service obligations (other than any unforgiven portions of our PPP loan principal) have provided sufficient liquidity for the business.\nCritical Accounting Judgments\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We generate all of our revenue from contracts with customers.\nEmbedded operating system software\nWe sell embedded operating system software licenses based upon a customer purchase order, shipping a certificate of authenticity (\u201cCOA\u201d) to satisfy this single performance obligation. These shipments are also subject to limited return rights; historically, returns have been insignificant. We recognize revenue from third-party products at the time of shipment when the customer accepts control of the COA.\nProprietary software\nWe sell our proprietary software products to customers under a contract or by purchase order. Our Edge to Cloud software contracts generally include professional services, a perpetual or term license and support and maintenance. In contracts with multiple performance obligations, we identify each performance obligation and evaluate whether the performance obligations are distinct within the context of the contract at contract inception. Performance obligations that are not distinct at contract inception are combined. Contracts that include software customization may result in the combination of the customization services with the software license as one distinct performance obligation. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price for each performance obligation. We then look to how control of the software transfers to the customer in order to determine the timing of revenue recognition. In contracts that include customer acceptance, we recognize revenue when we have delivered the software and received customer acceptance. We recognize revenue from support and maintenance over the service delivery period. We recognize revenue from royalties in the period of usage.\nOur software products generally do not include customization or modification services and are sold in the form of term licenses. These software licenses represent one distinct performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the software is delivered to the customer.\nProfessional services\nWe enter into contracts for professional services, including for our IoT-related service offerings, that include software development and customization. We identify each performance obligation in our professional services contracts at contract inception. The contracts generally include project deliverables specified by each customer. The contract pricing is either at stated billing rates per service hour and material costs or at a fixed amount. Services provided under professional engineering contracts generally result in the transfer of control of the applicable deliverable over time. We recognize revenue on service contracts based on time and materials as we have the right to invoice. We recognize revenue on fixed fee contracts on the proportion of labor hours expended to the total hours expected to complete the contract performance obligation. Certain professional service contracts include substantive customer acceptance provisions, in which case we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance.\nThe determination of the total labor hours expected to complete the performance obligations on fixed fee contracts involves significant judgment. We incorporate revisions to hour and cost estimates when the causal facts become known. In certain situations, when it is impractical for us to reasonably measure the outcome of a performance obligation, and where we anticipate that we will not incur a loss, an adjusted cost-based input method is used for revenue recognition. Equal amounts of revenue and cost are recognized during the contract period, and profit is recognized when the project is completed and accepted.\nLeases\nWe lease office facilities, primarily under operating leases, which expire at various dates through 2027. These leases generally contain renewal options for a defined number of years at the then-fair market rental rate or rate stipulated in the lease agreement, which we have an option to exercise at the end of the initial lease term.\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. On our balance sheet, our office facility leases are included in Right-of-Use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets and related lease liabilities are included in the Operating leases and Operating leases, long-term statement line items. ROU assets represent our right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease agreements. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the term of the lease. For leases that do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. We will use the implicit rate in the lease when readily determinable. The Company accounts for its lease expense with free rent periods and step-rent provisions on a straight-line basis over the original term of the lease and any extension options that the Company more likely than not expects to exercise, from the date the Company has control of the property. Certain leases provide for periodic rental increases based on price indices. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIntangible assets\nWe evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships arising from business acquisitions. We periodically assess the value of our intangible assets. Factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends. If this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired, we assess the likelihood of recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. If this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable, based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life, we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value.\nTaxes\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent not already utilized to offset taxable income or income taxes, also give rise to deferred tax assets. We must then assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. We are required to use judgment as to the appropriate weighting of all available evidence when assessing the need for the establishment or the release of valuation allowances. As part of this analysis, we examine all available evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis and weigh the positive and negative information when determining the need for full or partial valuation allowances. The evidence considered for each jurisdiction includes, among other items, (i) the historical levels of income or loss over a range of time periods that extends beyond the two years presented, (ii) the historical sources of income and losses, (iii) the expectations and risk associated with underlying estimates of future taxable income, (iv) the expectations and risk associated with new product offerings and uncertainties with the timing of future taxable income, and (v) prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. We estimate the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.\nOur sales may be subject to other taxes, particularly withholding taxes, due to our sales to customers in countries other than the United States. The tax regulations governing withholding taxes are complex, causing us to have to make assumptions about the appropriate tax treatment. Further, we make sales in many jurisdictions across the United States, where tax regulations are varied and complex. We must therefore continue to analyze our state tax exposure and determine what the appropriate tax treatments are, and make estimates for sales, franchise, income and other state taxes.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our summarized results of operations for the periods indicated. Our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period.\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands, except percentages)\n$ Change\n% Change\nRevenue\n$ 47,144\n$ 59,283\n$ (12,139 )\n(20 )%\nCost of revenue\n39,418\n49,187\n(9,769 )\n(20 )%\nGross profit\n7,726\n10,096\n(2,370 )\n(23 )%\nOperating expenses\n9,580\n19,410\n(9,830 )\n(51 )%\nLoss from operations\n(1,854 )\n(9,314 )\n7,460\n(80 )%\nOther income, net\n(35 )\n(184 )\n(123 )%\nLoss before income taxes\n(1,889 )\n(9,165 )\n7,276\n(79 )%\nIncome tax expense\n-\n(16 )\n(100 )%\nNet loss\n$ (1,889 )\n$ (9,181 )\n$ 7,292\n(79 )%\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sale of software, both embedded operating system software that we resell and our own proprietary software, and related professional services. Total revenue decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, due to decreased sales in our Partner Solutions segment, primarily in North America and Asia, as well as decreased revenue in our Edge to Cloud segment.\nAdditional revenue details were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands, except percentages)\n$ Change\n% Change\nRevenue:\nPartner Solutions\n$ 42,257\n$ 50,628\n$ (8,371 )\n(17 )%\nEdge to Cloud\n4,887\n8,655\n(3,768 )\n(44 )%\nTotal revenue\n$ 47,144\n$ 59,283\n$ (12,139 )\n(20 )%\nAs a percentage of total revenue:\nPartner Solutions\n%\n%\nEdge to Cloud\n%\n%\nPartner Solutions revenue\nPartner solutions revenue decreased $8.4 million and 17% in 2020 compared to 2019,We believe customer demand for embedded operating systems was adversely impacted by the economic downturn and related uncertainty stemming from the global COVID-19 pandemic. We have some customer concentration in industries particularly impacted by COVID-19, such as casino gaming, hospitality, and point-of-sale systems.\nEdge to Cloud revenue\nEdge to Cloud revenue decreased $3.8 million and 44% in 2020 compared to 2019, due primarily to professional services revenue earned in 2019 that was not repeated in 2020. We expect Edge to Cloud revenue will continue to vary in timing and amounts.\nGross profit and gross margin\nCost of Partner Solutions revenue consists primarily of the cost of embedded operating system software product costs payable to third-party vendors, net of rebate credits earned through Microsoft's distributor incentive program. Cost of Edge to Cloud revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits, contractor costs and re-billable expenses, and amortization of certain intangible assets related to acquisitions.\nGross profit and gross margin were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands, except percentages)\n$ Change\n% Change (1)\nPartner Solutions gross profit\n$ 7,086\n$ 7,430\n$ (344 )\n(5 )%\nPartner Solutions gross margin\n%\n%\n-\n%\nEdge to Cloud gross profit\n$\n$ 2,666\n$ (2,026 )\n(76 )%\nEdge to Cloud gross margin\n%\n%\n-\n(18 )%\nTotal gross profit\n$ 7,726\n$ 10,096\n$ (2,370 )\n(23 )%\nTotal gross margin\n%\n%\n-\n(1 )%\n(1) For gross margin, amounts represent percentage point change.\nPartner Solutions gross profit declined in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily as a result of lower third-party software sales. Partner Solutions gross margin was favorably impacted by rebate credits earned through Microsoft\u2019s distributor incentives program. In accordance with program rules, we allocate a portion of the incentive earnings to reduce cost of revenue with the remaining portion utilized to offset qualified marketing expenses in the period the expenditures are claimed and approved. During 2019, 20% was allocated to offset cost of revenue and the remaining 80% was potentially available to offset qualified marketing expenses. During the second quarter of 2020 the program allocation was changed by Microsoft to a 50/50 split between the two components. In 2020, we recorded approximately $757,000 in rebate credits as an offset to cost of revenue compared to approximately $314,000 in 2019.\nPartner Solutions gross margin was also favorably impacted by a small amount of revenue for which only the margin is recognized as revenue given our role as agent in the transaction.\nEdge to Cloud gross profit and gross margin decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to decreased sales of software and services in 2020 compared to 2019 and lower margin project work.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands, except percentages)\n$ Change\n% Change\nOperating expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative\n$ 9,314\n$ 11,316\n$ (2,002 )\n(18 )%\nResearch and development\n5,751\n(5,485 )\n(95 )%\nRestructuring costs\n-\n2,343\n(2,343 )\n- %\nTotal operating expenses\n$ 9,580\n$ 19,410\n$ (9,830 )\n%\nAs a percentage of total revenue:\nSelling, general and administrative\n%\n%\nResearch and development\n%\n%\nRestructuring costs\n- %\n%\nSelling, general and administrative\nSelling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, commissions and bonuses for our sales, marketing and administrative personnel and related facilities and depreciation costs, as well as professional services fees (such as consulting, legal, audit and tax). SG&A expenses decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to lower salaries and related benefits resulting from prior period restructuring efforts, and from lower professional services fees and contract labor. These reductions were partially offset by increased stock-based compensation expense.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development (\u201cR&D\u201d) expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software development and quality assurance personnel, and contractor and consultant costs. R&D expenses decreased in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower salaries and related benefits resulting from restructuring efforts in prior periods, including the elimination of R&D positions.\nRestructuring costs\nRestructuring costs incurred during 2019 include $1.9 million in severance and benefits related to a workforce reduction plan announced by management in the second quarter of 2019 and a non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2019 of $0.4 million related to certain software development cost assets. There were no restructuring costs incurred during 2020.\nOther income (loss), net\nOther income and loss consist primarily of interest income on our cash and investments, gains and losses we may recognize on our investments, gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions and other items. The decrease in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower total interest earned on our cash and investments and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nIncome taxes\nIncome tax expense for 2020 and 2019 related to state and local income taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $13.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments (including $0.3 million in restricted cash), compared to $10.6 million at December 31, 2019, reflecting a net increase of approximately $2.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. We generally invest our excess cash in high quality marketable investments. These investments generally include corporate notes and bonds, commercial paper and money market funds, although specific holdings can vary from period to period depending upon our cash requirements. Our investments held at December 31, 2019 had minimal default risk and short-term maturities. There were no investments held at December 31, 2020.\nOperating activities provided cash of approximately $1.1 million in 2020, which included a net loss of $1.9 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustments of $1.4 million and a change in working capital of approximately $1.5 million. Operating activities used cash of approximately $6.0 million in 2019, which included a net loss of approximately $9.2 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustments of approximately $1.8 million and a change in working capital of approximately $1.4 million.\nInvesting activities provided cash of approximately $2.0 million in 2020, primarily due to net cash inflows on short-term investments of $2.3 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $0.3 million. Investing activities provided cash of approximately $3.9 million in 2019, primarily due to net cash inflows on short-term investments of $4.3 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $0.4 million.\nFinancing activities provided $1.6 million of cash in 2020 due to proceeds from the PPP Loan. There was no cash provided by financing activities in 2019.\nWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.\nContractual commitments\nFuture operating lease commitments were as follows as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2020, maturities of lease liabilities were as follows:\nOperating leases\nYears Ended December 31,\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nThereafter\n$\nTotal minimum lease payments\n2,310\nLess: amount representing interest\n(336 )\nPresent value of lease liabilities\n$ 1,974\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.",

Vardeman has been a director since June 2018. Mr. Vardeman is a principal and co-founder of Palogic Value Management, L.P., a Dallas, Texas based investment management company, a position he has held since January 2007. Mr. Vardeman has extensive corporate strategy, operating, financial and investment experience including capital structure analysis, a focus on small-cap equities, and investing in a broad range of industries with an emphasis on technology and software companies. Mr. Vardeman holds a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Texas Tech University and an M.B.A. from the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University. The Board of Directors has concluded that Mr. Vardeman should serve as a director because of his extensive financial and operational experience and given his affiliation with one of our largest shareholders.\nBoard of Directors Leadership Structure\nThe Board of Directors has adopted a structure under which the Chairman of the Board is an independent director. We believe that having a Chairman independent of management provides effective leadership for the Board of Directors and helps ensure critical and independent thinking with respect to our strategy and performance. In addition, the Board believes this governance structure promotes balance between the Board's independent authority to oversee our business and the Chief Executive Officer and his management team who manage the business on a day-to-day basis. Moreover, the current separation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles allows the Chief Executive Officer to focus his time and energy on operating and managing the business while leveraging the experience and perspectives of the Chairman. Our Chief Executive Officer has historically served as a member of and as the sole management representative on the Board of Directors. Mr. Derrickson is a director as well as our President and Chief Executive Officer. We believe it is important to enable our Chief Executive Officer to provide information and insight about us directly to the directors in their deliberations. Further, our Board of Directors believes that separating the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board roles as well as having the Chairman of the Board role represented by an independent director is the appropriate leadership structure for us at this time and demonstrates our commitment to effective corporate governance.\nOur Chairman of the Board is responsible for the effective functioning of our Board of Directors, enhancing its efficacy by guiding its processes and presiding at Board of Directors meetings and executive sessions of the independent directors. Our Chairman presides at shareholder meetings and ensures that directors receive appropriate information from our management to fulfill their responsibilities. Our Chairman also acts as a liaison between our Board of Directors and executive management, promoting clear and open communication between management and the Board of Directors.\nBoard of Directors Role in Risk Oversight\nOur Board of Directors has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. Our Board, either as a whole or through its committees, regularly discusses with management our major risk exposures, their potential impact on us and the steps we take to manage them. While our Board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, our Board committees assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk. In particular, our Audit Committee focuses on financial, accounting and investment risks and oversees and approves company-wide risk management practices. Our Governance and Nominating Committee focuses on the management of risks associated with Board organization, membership, structure and corporate governance. In addition, our Compensation Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks arising from our compensation policies and programs and related to succession planning for our executive officers.\nBoard of Directors Independence\nThe Board of Directors has determined, after consideration of all relevant factors, that each of Messrs. Chamberlain, Cushman, Harries, Peters and Vardeman and Ms. Jesse, together constituting a majority of our Board of Directors, qualifies as an \u201cindependent\u201d director as defined under applicable rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) and that none of such directors has any relationship with us that would interfere with the exercise of their independent business judgment. Mr. Derrickson does not qualify as an \u201cindependent\u201d director under applicable NASDAQ rules because he serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer.\nStanding Committees and Attendance\nThe Board of Directors held six meetings during 2020. All directors attended more than 75% of the aggregate of the meetings of the Board of Directors and committees thereof, if any, upon which such director served during the period for which he or she was a director or committee member during 2020.\nThe Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Governance and Nominating Committee. Information about these standing committees and committee meetings is set forth below.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee is currently comprised of Messrs. Chamberlain (Committee Chair) and Harries and Ms. Jesse. The Board of Directors has determined that, after consideration of all relevant factors, each of these directors qualifies as an \u201cindependent\u201d director under applicable SEC and NASDAQ rules. Each member of the Audit Committee is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows. No member of the Audit Committee has participated in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, or those of any of our current subsidiaries, at any time during the past three years. The Board of Directors has designated Mr. Chamberlain as an \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d as defined under applicable SEC rules and has determined that Mr. Chamberlain possesses the requisite \u201cfinancial sophistication\u201d under applicable NASDAQ rules.\nThe Audit Committee operates under a written charter setting forth the functions and responsibilities of the committee, which is reviewed by the committee on an annual basis, and by the Board of Directors as appropriate. A current copy of the Audit Committee charter is available on our website at www.bsquare.com on the Corporate Governance page under Management and Corporate Governance - Board Committees and Charter Documents.\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing our independent auditors, including their selection, retention and compensation, reviewing and approving the scope of audit and other services by our independent auditors, reviewing the accounting policies, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements and reviewing the results of our audits. The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures, including risk management, establishing procedures regarding complaints concerning accounting or auditing matters, reviewing and, if appropriate, approving related-party transactions, reviewing compliance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and reviewing our investment policy and compliance therewith. The Audit Committee held four meetings during 2020.\nCompensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee currently consists of Messrs. Cushman, Harries and Vardeman (Committee Chair). The Board of Directors has determined that, after consideration of all relevant factors, each of these directors qualifies as an \u201cindependent\u201d and \u201cnon-employee\u201d director under applicable NASDAQ and SEC rules. The Compensation Committee makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding our general compensation policies as well as the compensation plans and specific compensation levels for its executive officers. The Compensation Committee held six meetings during 2020.\nThe Compensation Committee has a number of functions and responsibilities as delineated in its written charter, which is reviewed by the committee on an annual basis, and by the Board of Directors as appropriate. A current copy of the Compensation Committee charter is available on our website at www.bsquare.com on the Corporate Governance page under Management and Corporate Governance - Board Committees and Charter Documents.\nOne of the primary responsibilities of the Compensation Committee is to oversee, and make recommendations to the Board of Directors for its approval of, the compensation programs and performance of our executive officers, which includes the following activities:\n\u25cf\nEstablishing the objectives and philosophy of the executive compensation programs;\n\u25cf\nDesigning and implementing the compensation programs;\n\u25cf\nEvaluating the performance of executives relative to their attainment of goals under the programs and reporting its evaluation to the Board of Directors;\n\u25cf\nDeveloping and maintaining a succession plan for the Chief Executive Officer;\n\u25cf\nCalculating and establishing payouts and awards under the programs as well as discretionary payouts and awards;\n\u25cf\nReviewing base salary levels and equity ownership of the executives; and\n\u25cf\nEngaging consultants from time to time, as appropriate, to assist with program design and related matters.\nAdditional information regarding the roles, responsibilities, scope and authority of the Compensation Committee, as well as the extent to which the Committee may delegate its authority, the role that our executive officers serve in recommending compensation and the role of compensation consultants in our compensation process is set forth under"

Givemepower is primarily focused on: (1) creating and empowering local black businesses in urban America; and (2) creating real estate properties and businesses in opportunity zones and other distressed neighborhood across America. This Offering represents the commencement of the Banking and financial services division of our business. This Offering will enable GMPW to become a financial technology company (FINTEC) business that (1) one-to-four branch federally licensed bank in each jurisdiction, (2) a machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) enabled loan and insurance underwriting platform, (3) blockchain-powered transaction processing and payment systems, (4) cryptocurrency transaction processing platform, and (5) emerging cryptocurrency opportunities portfolio; giving access to the unbanked, underserved residents of majorly black communities across the United State. This is the fulfillment of mission of operating and managing a portfolio of real estate and financial services assets and operations to empower black persons in the United States through financial tools and resources, with a primary focused on: (1) creating and empowering local black businesses in urban America; and (2) creating real estate properties and businesses in opportunity zones and other distressed neighborhood across America. Our FINTEC operations would cover the basic areas of traditional banking-digitally enhance, ML and Ai enabled lending and insurance underwriting, areas of private equity, business lending and venture capital that invest in young black entrepreneurs, and seeding their viable business plans/ideas on block-chain-powered financial services delivery platform that connects, black entrepreneurs, black borrowers, consumers, banks, and institutional investors. Our real estate division invests in Opportunity Zones, Affordable Housing, and specialized real estate properties.\nBusiness History\nGiveMePower Corporation (the \u201cPubCo\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d), a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on June 7, 2001 to sell software geared to end users and developers involved in the design, manufacture, and construction of engineered products located in Canada and the United States. The PubCo has been dormant and non-operating since year 2009. PubCo is a public reporting company registered with the Securities Exchange Commissioner (\u201cSEC\u201d). In November 2009, the Company filed Form 15D, Suspension of Duty to Report, and as a result, the Company was not required to file any SEC forms since November 2009.\nOn December 31, 2020, PubCo sold one Special 2019 series A preferred share (\u201cSeries A Share\u201d) for $38,000 to Goldstein Franklin, Inc. (\u201cGoldstein\u201d), a California corporation. One Series A Share is convertible to 100,000,000 shares of common stocks at any time. The Series A Share also provided with 60% voting rights of the PubCo. On the same day, Goldstein sold one-member unit of Alpharidge Capital, LLC (\u201cAlpharidge\u201d), a California limited liability corporation, representing 100% member owner of Alpharidge. As a result, Alpharidge become a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company\u2019s operating structure did not change as a result of the change of control, however, following the transaction on December 31, 2019, in which Goldstein Franklin, Inc. acquired control of the Company, Goldstein transferred one of its operating subsidiaries, Alpharidge Capital LLC into GMPW to become one of the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries.\nAlpharidge Capital LLC (\u201cAlpharidge\u201d) was formed under the laws of the State of California on August 30, 2019. Alpharidge has two distinct lines of businesses that comprise: (1) a specialty biopharmaceutical holding company focused on building portfolio of real estate investment properties and equity positions in select companies within select industries; and (2) an event-driven investment management operation that invests in equities, warrants, bonds and options of public and private companies in America and across the globe.\nPrior to the transaction, the Company sell software geared to end users and developers involved in the design, manufacture, and construction of engineered products located in Canada and the United States.\nOn September 16, 2020, as part of its sales of unregistered securities to Kid Castle Educational Corporation, company related to, and controlled by GMPW President and CEO, the Company, for $3 in cash and 1,000,000 shares of its preferred stock, acquired 100% interest in, and control of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC (\u201cCED Capital\u201d), a California Limited Liability Company, and 97% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (\u201cCBDX\u201d), a California corporation. This transaction was accounted for under the Consolidation Method using the variable interest entity (VIE) model wherein the Company consolidates all investees operating results if the Company expects to assume more than 50% of another entity\u2019s expected losses or gains. The 1,000,000 shares of our preferred stock sold to Kid Castle Educational Corporation gave to Kid Castle, approximately 87% voting control of Givemepower Corporation.\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company therefore include its wholly owned subsidiaries of Alpharidge Capital LLC. (\u201cAlpharidge\u201d), Community Economic Development Capital, LLC. (\u201cCED Capital\u201d), and Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (\u201cCBDX\u201d), and subsidiaries, in which GiveMePower has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d) provisions of ASC 810, \u201cConsolidation\u201d (\u201cASC 810\u201d), after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts.\nThe Company\u2019s principal executive office is located at 370 Amapola Ave., Suite 200A, Torrance, CA 90501.\nThe Company\u2019s main telephone number is (310) 895-1839.\nCurrent Business and Organization - Alpharidge\nThe Company, through its three wholly owned subsidiaries, Alpharidge Capital, LLC (\u201cAlpharidge\u201d), Malcom Wingate Cush Franklin LLC (\u201cMWCF\u201d), and Opportunity Zone Capital LLC (\u201cOZC\u201d), seeks to empower black persons in the United States through financial tools and resources as follows:\n\u00b7 Alpharidge and OZC Real estate operations - Real estate operations would consist primarily of rental real estate, affordable housing projects, opportunity zones, other property development and associated HOA activities. OZC development operations would be primarily through a real estate investment, management and development subsidiary that focuses primarily on the construction and sale of single-family and multi-family homes, lots in subdivisions and planned communities, and raw land for residential development; and\n\u00b7 MWCF financial empowerment - MWCF would utilize operate the tools of financial education/training, mergers and acquisitions, private equity and business lending to invest and empower young black entrepreneurs, seeding their viable business plans and ideas and creating jobs in their communities. MWCF is primarily focused on: (1) creating and empowering local black businesses in urban America; and (2) creating real estate in opportunity zones and other distressed neighborhood across America.\n\u00b7 Cash Management, Opportunistic and Event-Driven Investments: The Company keeps no more than 10% of its total assets in liquid cash or investments portfolio, which is actively managed by its directors and officers and invest primarily in equity investments on a long and short basis. The Company\u2019s cash management policy which requires that the Company actively invests its excess cash into stocks, bonds and other securities is intended to provide the company greater levels of liquidity and current income. The Company uses proprietary trading models to capitalize on real-time market anomalies and generate ongoing income in the forms similar to hedge funds. Where necessary, the Company uses seeded entities to pursue real-time market transactions in publicly traded securities including but not limited to stocks, bonds, options, futures, forex, warrants, and other instruments.\nCurrent Business and Organization - CED Capital\nCommunity Economic Development Capital, LLC. (\u201cCED Capital\u201d), a California limited liability company, is a specialty real estate holding company for specialized assets including, affordable housing, opportunity zones properties, industrial and commercial real estate, and other real estate related services. CED Capital principal business objective is to maximize returns through a combination of (1) generating good profit while making substantial social impact, (2) sustainable long-term growth in cash flows from increased rents, and (3) potential long-term appreciation in the value of its properties from capital gains upon future sale. The Company is engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, acquisition, development and redevelopment of predominantly multifamily housing and specialized industrial properties in the United States. Additionally, its specialized industrial property strategy is to acquire and own a portfolio of specialized industrial properties, including multifamily properties. This strategy includes the following components:\n\uf0b7\nOwning Specialized Real Estate Properties and Assets for Income. The Company intends to acquire multifamily housings, economic development real estates, and multifamily properties. The Company expects to hold acquired properties for investment and to generate stable and increasing rental income from leasing these properties to licensed growers.\n\uf0b7\nOwning Specialized Real Estate Properties and Assets for Appreciation. The Company intends to lease its acquired properties under long-term, triple-net leases. However, from time to time, the Company may elect to sell one or more properties if the Company believes it to be in the best interests of its stockholders. Accordingly, the Company will seek to acquire properties that it believes also have potential for long-term appreciation in value.\n\uf0b7\nAffordable Housing. Its motto is: \u201cacquiring distressed/troubled properties, securing generous government subsidies, empowering low-income families, and generating above-market returns to investors.\u201d\n\uf0b7\nPreserving Financial Flexibility on the Company\u2019s Balance Sheet. The Company intends to focus on maintaining a conservative capital structure, in order to provide us flexibility in financing its growth initiatives.\nCurrent Business and Organization - CBDX\nCannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (\u201cCBDZ\u201d), a California corporation was incorporated on May 6, 2014, to operate as a biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical holding company that engages in the discovery, development, and commercialization of cures and novel therapeutics from cannabinoid, cannabidiol, endocannabinoids, phytocannabinoids, and synthetic cannabinoids product platform suitable for specific treatments in a broad range of disease areas. CBDZ engages in biopharmaceutical research and development operation with aim of identifying viable drug candidates to go into clinical trials and if successful, be submitted to the FDA for approval.\nBlackBank, Blockchain-Powered Fintech, Ai and ML Enabled Lending, and CryptoCurrency Deals\nThe Company intends to actualize its banking and financial services operations goals through acquisition and management of (1) a one-to-four branch bank that is federally licensed in each jurisdiction; (2) a machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (Ai) enabled loan and insurance underwriting platform; (3) blockchain-powered transaction processing and payment systems; (4) cryptocurrency transaction processing platform; and (5) emerging cryptocurrency opportunities portfolio; a combination of three of which would connects consumers, banks, institutional investors, and ensure access to the unbanked and underserved residents of majorly black communities across the United State of America.\n(1) BlackBank - Proposed Federally licensed one-four branch bank\nJurisdictionally, GMPW intend to acquire and manage one-four branch bank in each of its relevant jurisdictional domain. Owning/controlling a bank or banks with branches across every urban/black neighborhood in the United States is not our goal. Rather we would be content to own a one-four branch bank in every relevant jurisdiction to allow us to initiate/conduct ML-Ai enabled and blockchain-powered digitized banking that is accessible to all black person and businesses across the United States. We intend to start our banking acquisition by finding targets that operates one-four branches. We intend to start with the acquisition of one-four branch bank, whose operation and back-office would be migrated unto a Blockchain-powered platform to digitize its entire banking operation to cover and serve all black persons in the United States. We believe that blockchain technology is one of the most suited platform to implement, run and manage a U.S. wide digitized banking services whose reach encompasses most black persons living in the United States.\n(2) Cloud-Based Machine-Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Enabled Lending and Insurance Underwriting Platform\nOnce it has raised sufficient capital (proposed $10 million offering), the Company intends to launch the Company\u2019s cloud-based machine learning and artificial intelligence lending platform. It is our believe that Machine-Learning (ML) and Artificial intelligence (AI), lending and insurance underwriting platform would enable a superior loan product with improved economics that can be shared between consumers and lenders. The proposed platform would aggregate consumer demand for high-quality loans and connects it to our soon-to-be-build network of ML-AI-enabled investors, lenders and bank partners. Consumers on the ML-AI platform would benefit from a highly automated, efficient, all-digital experience. Our prospective bank partners would benefit from access to new customers, lower fraud and loss rates, and increased automation throughout the lending process.\nCredit is a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, and access to affordable credit is central to unlocking upward mobility and opportunity. The FICO score was invented in 1989 and remains the standard for determining who is approved for credit and at what interest rate. (Rob Kaufman, myFico Blog: The History of the FICO Score, August 2018). While FICO is rarely the only input in a lending decision, most banks use simple, rules-based systems that consider only a limited number of variables. Unfortunately, because legacy credit systems fail to properly identify and quantify risk, millions of creditworthy individuals are left out of the system, and millions more pay too much to borrow money. (Patrice Ficklin and Paul Watkins, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Blog: An Update on Credit Access and the Bureau\u2019s First No-Action Letter, August 2019).\nThe first generation of online lenders focused on bringing credit online. Analogous to earlier internet pioneers, these companies made shopping for and accessing credit simpler and easier for consumers and businesses. It was no longer necessary to stand in line at a bank branch, to sit across the desk from a loan officer and to wait weeks or months for a decision. These lenders enabled the emergence of personal loan products that were previously unprofitable for banks to offer. While they brought the credit process online, they inherited the decision frameworks that banks had used for decades and did not address the more rewarding and challenging opportunity of reinventing the credit decision.\nGMPW intend to leverage the power of AI to more accurately quantify the true risk of a loan. The ML- AI models would be built to continuously self-upgrade, train and refine many critical components of lending risk analytics and decision-making on a real-time basis. We intend to build discrete ML- AI models that target fee optimization, income fraud, acquisition targeting, loan stacking, prepayment prediction, identity fraud and time-delimited default prediction. These models would be designed to incorporate multiple lending underwriting variables and utilize training dataset that accounts for varieties of repayment events. It is also anticipated that the network effects generated by constantly improving ML- AI models would provide a significant competitive advantage-and more training data would lead to higher approval rates and lower interest rates at the same loss rate\n(3) Blockchain-Powered Digital Currency Payment and Financial Transactions Processing platform (\u201cBlackchain\u201d)\nThe Company intends to acquire an existing, or build-from-the-scratch, a Blockchain-Powered Digital Currency Payment and Financial Transactions Processing platform (\u201cBlackchain\u201d), with home in the BlackBank alongside the ML-AI lending platform. Blockchain-powered Payment and Financial Transactions Processing platform would also provide efficient and inexpensive payment platform and merchant services to black businesses across the United States.\nThe company would establish an exchange network called Blackchain Exchange Network (\u201cBEN\u201d), a Payment and Financial Transactions Processing platform, would be a wholly-owned subsidiary, the BlackBank. We believe Blackchain would be a leading provider of innovative financial infrastructure solutions and services to participants in the nascent and expanding digital currency industry. Blackchain business strategy is floating a Blackchain Exchange Network, or BEN, a virtually instantaneous payment network for participants in the digital currency industry which would serve as a platform for the development of additional products and services. The BEN would have a network effect that would make it valuable as participants and utilization increase, leading to good growth in BEN transaction volumes. The BEN would enable the BlackBank to prioritize, build and significantly grow noninterest bearing deposit product for digital currency industry participants, which is expected to provide the majority of our bank funding in the next two years from finalizing acquisition. This unique source of funding would be a distinctive advantage over most traditional financial institutions and allows BlackBank to generate revenue from a conservative portfolio of investments in cash, short term securities and ML-Ai enabled loans that we believe generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition, use of the BEN would result in an increase in noninterest income that we believe will become a valuable source of additional future revenue as we develop and deploy blockchain-powered, fee-based solutions in connection with our digital currency initiative. We would also evaluate additional products or product enhancements specifically targeted at providing further financial infrastructure solutions to our customers and strengthening BEN network effects.\nBlackchain Business Overview\nOnce acquired, the Federally licensed one-four branch bank would be such that is already providing banking and financial services including commercial banking, business lending, commercial and residential real estate lending and mortgage warehouse lending, all funded primarily by interest bearing deposits and borrowings. To that up and running banking and financial services operation, we intend to insert a Blockchain-powered payment and transaction processing system and digital currency platform. We intend to pursue digital currency customers and bring them into the BlackBank to bank with us using digital currency. We believe we could effectively leverage the traditional commercial bank platform, the ML-Ai enabled lending platform and the attributes of the BEN to gain traction in the digital currency banking industry.\nWe intend to focus on the digital currency initiative as the core of our future strategy and direction. We intend to build a leadership position in the digital currency industry as a result of the BEN to enable us to establish a significant balance of noninterest bearing deposits from digital currency customer base. Over several post-acquisition years, BlackBank would have transitioned from a traditional asset based bank model focused on loan generation to a deposit and solutions based model focused on increasing noninterest bearing deposits and noninterest income. This emphasis on noninterest bearing deposits and noninterest income, is primarily associated with digital currency, will likely result in a significant shift in BlackBank\u2019s asset composition with a greater percentage consisting of liquid assets such as interest earning deposits in other banks and investment securities, and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of loans. Most of our actions would be focused on developing and delivering highly scalable and operationally efficient solutions for BlackBank\u2019s digital currency customers.\n(4) Emerging Cryptocurrency Opportunities Portfolio\nThe emerging cryptocurrency opportunities portfolio is the wildcard of our FINTEC business model. While the goals are clear, because it is a wildcard, there is no outline on what to expect or how it should be run. GMPW needs these flexibilities because many established companies are jumping into the crypocurrency opportunities on a minutes notice. For example, in 2020, Microstrategy decided to move their treasury into bitcoin as part of their cash management strategy. Marathon Patent Group moved into cryptocurrency mining as a business model. Overstock has been in cryptocurrency for a while. Square and Paypal just joined the bandwagon of American companies that try to find and exploit opportunities in the crypto currency industry without abandoning their actual businesses. GMPW\u2019s emerging cryptocurrency opportunities portfolio would not be different. The company would on an ongoing basis evaluate and consider investments into potentially viable cryptocurrency opportunities anywhere.\nManagement Capacity\nGiveMePower Corporation (\u201cGMPW\u201d) intends to fulfill its goal to become a financial technology company (FINTEC) that provides machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) enabled banking and financial services on blockchain-powered platforms, giving access to the unbanked, underserved, and residents of majorly black communities across the United State. We would be empowered to actualize our banking and financial services operations which comprises of: (1) a one-four branch bank, (2) a ML-Ai lending platform, and (3) a Blockchain-Powered Payment and Financial Transactions Processing, and Digital Currency platform. We plan to acquire a one-four branch Bank; acquire and integrate into the Bank, or build-from-the-scratch a Cloud-Based Machine-Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Lending platform; and acquire and integrate into the BlackBank, or build-from-the-scratch a Blockchain-Powered Payment and Financial Transactions Processing, and Digital Currency platform. All three would operate together as a modern digitized banking and financial services provider focusing to giving access to black entrepreneurs, black borrowers, consumers, banks, and institutional investors.\nOur Banking and FINTEC business model is a newly created business model created in the 3rd quarter of 2020, for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar Business acquisition with (1) a one-four branch bank, (2) a ML-Ai lending platform, and (3) a Blockchain-Powered Payment and Financial Transactions Processing, and Digital Currency platform. We have not selected any specific bank, Fintec or Digital Currency Business acquisition target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency Business acquisition target.\nOur management team is comprised of two business professionals that have a broad range of experience in executive leadership, strategy development and implementation, operations management, financial policy and corporate transactions. Our management team members have worked together in the past, at Goldstein Franklin, Inc. and other firms as executive leaders and senior managers spearheading turnarounds, rollups and industry-focused consolidation while generating shareholder value for many for investors and stakeholders.\nWe believe that our management team is well positioned to identify acquisition opportunities in the marketplace. Our management team's industry expertise, principal investing transaction experience and business acumen will make us an attractive partner and enhance our ability to complete a successful Business acquisition. Our management believes that its ability to identify and implement value creation initiatives has been an essential driver of past performance and will remain central to its differentiated acquisition strategy.\nAlthough our management team is well positioned and have experience to identify acquisition opportunities in the marketplace, past performance of our management team is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency business acquisition we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition. You should not rely on the historical performance record of our management team as indicative of our future performance. Additionally, in the course of their respective careers, members of our management team have been involved in businesses and deals that were unsuccessful. Our officers and directors have not had management experience with Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency companies in the past.\nGiveMePower Corporation, prior to September 15, 2020, used to be a specialty real estate holding company, focuses on the acquisition, ownership, and management of specialized industrial properties. The Company\u2019s real estate business objective is to maximize stockholder returns through a combination of (1) distributions to our stockholders, (2) sustainable long-term growth in cash flows from increased rents, which we hope to pass on to stockholders in the form of increased distributions, and (3) potential long-term appreciation in the value of our properties from capital gains upon future sale. As a real estate holding company, the Company is engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, acquisition, development and redevelopment of predominantly multifamily housing and specialized industrial properties in the United States.\nBusiness Strategy and Deal Origination\nWe have not finalized an acquisition target yet, but making progress in identifying several potential candidates from which we intend to pick those that meet our criteria for acquisition. Our acquisition and value creation strategy will be to identify, acquire (1) a one-four branch Bank, (2) a ML-Ai lending platform, and (3) a Blockchain-Powered Payment and Financial Transactions Processing, and Digital Currency platform; after bank acquisition, to integrate the ML-AI lending platform and the Blackchain into the Bank\u2019s operations. Our Business acquisition strategy will leverage our management team's network of potential transaction sources, where we believe a combination of our relationships, knowledge and experience could effect a positive transformation or augmentation of existing businesses to improve their overall value proposition.\nOur management team's objective is to generate attractive returns and create value for our shareholders by applying our disciplined strategy of underwriting intrinsic worth and implementing changes after making an acquisition to unlock value. While our approach is focused on the Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency industries where we have differentiated insights, we also have successfully driven change through a comprehensive value creation plan framework. We favor opportunities where we can accelerate the target's growth initiatives. As a management team we have successfully applied this approach over approximately 16 years and have deployed capital successfully in a range of market cycles.\nWe plan to utilize the network and Finance industry experience of our Chief Executive Officer and our management team in seeking an Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition and employing our Business acquisition strategy described below. Our CEO is a top financial professional with designations that include, CPA, CMA, and CFM. He\u2019s very knowledgeable in the fields of corporate law, real estate, lending, turnarounds and restructuring. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will serve as a useful source of Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition opportunities. This network has been developed through our management team's extensive experience:\n\u00b7 investing in and operating a wide range of businesses;\n\u00b7 growing brands through repositioning, increasing household penetration and geographic expansion; expanding into new distribution channels, such as e-Commerce, in an increasingly omni-channel world;\n\u00b7 identifying lessons learned and applying solutions across product portfolios and channels;\n\u00b7 sourcing, structuring, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, financing and selling businesses;\n\u00b7 developing relationships with sellers, financing providers, advisors and target management teams; and\n\u00b7 executing transformational transactions in a wide range of businesses under varying economic and financial market conditions.\n\u00b7 In addition, drawing on their extensive investing and operating experience, our management team anticipates tapping four major sources of deal flow:\n\u00b7 directly identifying potentially attractive undervalued situations through primary research into Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency industries and companies;\n\u00b7 receiving information from our management team's global contacts about a potentially attractive situation;\n\u00b7 leads from investment bankers and advisors regarding businesses seeking a combination or added value that matches our strengths; and\n\u00b7 inbound opportunities from a company or existing stakeholders seeking a combination, including corporate divestitures.\nWe expect this network will provide our management team with a robust flow of Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency Business candidates will be brought to our attention by various unaffiliated sources, which may include investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises. Upon completion of this offering, members of our management team will communicate with their network of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential Business acquisition and begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potential leads.\nAcquisition/Business acquisition Criteria\nConsistent with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities. While we intend to acquire Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency companies that we believe exhibit one or more of the following characteristics, we may decide to enter into our initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition with a target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency companies that source, design, develop, manufacture and distribute high-performance, affordable and fully Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency :\n\u00b7 have potential for significant growth, or can act as an attractive Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition platform, following our initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition;\n\u00b7 have demonstrated market segment, category and/or cost leadership and would benefit from our extensive network and insights;\n\u00b7 provide operational platform and/or infrastructure for variety of Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency models and/or services, with the potential for revenue, market share, footprint and/or distribution improvements;\n\u00b7 are at the forefront of Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency evolution around changing consumer trends;\n\u00b7 offer marketing, pricing and product mix optimization opportunities across distribution channels;\n\u00b7 are fundamentally sound companies that could be underperforming their potential and/or offer compelling value;\n\u00b7 offer the opportunity for our management team to partner with established target management teams or business owners to achieve long-term strategic and operational excellence, or, in some cases, where our access to accomplished executives and the skills of the management of identified targets warrants replacing or supplementing existing management;\n\u00b7 exhibit unrecognized value or other characteristics, desirable returns on capital and a need for capital to achieve the company's growth strategy, that we believe have been misevaluated by the marketplace based on our analysis and due diligence review; and\n\u00b7 will offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our shareholders.\nThese criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency Business acquisition may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency Business acquisition with a target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency Business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency Business does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency Business acquisition.\nAcquisition/Business acquisition Process\nIn evaluating a prospective target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information. We will also utilize our operational and capital allocation experience.\nIn order to execute our business strategy, we intend to:\nAssemble a team of Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency industry and financial experts: For each potential transaction, we intend to assemble a team of Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency industry and financial experts to supplement our management's efforts to identify and resolve key issues facing a target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency Business. We intend to construct an operating and financial plan that optimizes the potential to grow shareholder value. With extensive experience investing in both healthy and underperforming businesses, we expect that our management will be able to demonstrate to the target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency business and its stakeholders that we have the resources and expertise to lead the combined company through complex and potentially turbulent market conditions and provide the strategic and operational direction necessary to grow the business in order to maximize cash flows and improve the overall strategic prospects for the company.\nConduct rigorous research and analysis: Performing disciplined, fundamental research and analysis is core to our strategy, and we intend to conduct extensive due diligence to evaluate the impact that a transaction may have on a target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency Business.\nBusiness acquisition driven by trend analysis: We intend to understand the underlying purchase and industry behaviors that would enhance a potential transaction's attractiveness. We have extensive experience in identifying and analyzing evolving industry and consumer trends, and we expect to perform macro as well as bottoms-up analysis on consumer and industry trends.\nAcquire the target company at an attractive price relative to our view of intrinsic value: Combining rigorous analysis as well as input from industry and financial experts, our management team intends to develop its view of the intrinsic value of a potential Business acquisition. In doing so, our management team will evaluate future cash flow potential, relative industry valuation metrics and precedent transactions to inform its view of intrinsic value, with the intention of creating a Business acquisition at an attractive price relative to its view of intrinsic value.\nImplement operational and financial structuring opportunities: Our management team has the ability to structure and execute a Business acquisition that will establish a capital structure that will support the growth in shareholder value and give it the flexibility to grow organically and/or through strategic acquisitions. We intend to also develop and implement strategies and initiatives to improve the business' operational and financial performance and create a platform for growth.\nSeek strategic acquisitions and divestitures to further grow shareholder value: Our management team intends to analyze the strategic direction of the company, including evaluating potential non-core asset sales to create financial and/or operational flexibility for the company to engage in organic and/or inorganic growth. Our management team intends to evaluate strategic opportunities and chart a clear path to take the Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency business to the next level after the Business acquisition.\nAfter the initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition, our management team intends to apply a rigorous approach to enhancing shareholder value, including evaluating the experience and expertise of incumbent management and making changes where appropriate, examining opportunities for revenue enhancement, cost savings, operating efficiencies and strategic acquisitions and divestitures and developing and implementing corporate strategies and initiatives to improve profitability and long-term value. In doing so, our management team anticipates evaluating corporate governance, opportunistically accessing capital markets and other opportunities to enhance liquidity, identifying acquisition and divestiture opportunities and properly aligning management and board incentives with growing shareholder value. Our management team intends to pursue post-merger initiatives through participation on the board of directors, through direct involvement with company operations and/or calling upon a stable of former managers and advisors when necessary.\nStrategic Approach to Management. We intend to approach the management of a company as strategy consultants would. This means that we approach business with performance-based metrics based on strategic and operational goals, both at the overall company level and for specific divisions and functions.\nCorporate Governance and Oversight. Active participation as board members can include many activities ranging from conducting monthly or quarterly board meetings to chairing standing (compensation, audit or investment committees) or special committees, replacing or supplementing company management teams when necessary, adding outside directors with industry expertise which may or may not include members of our own board of directors, providing guidance on strategic and operational issues including revenue enhancement opportunities, cost savings, brand repositioning, operating efficiencies, reviewing and testing annual budgets, reviewing acquisitions and divestitures and assisting in the accessing of capital markets to further optimize financing costs and fund expansion.\nDirect Operational Involvement. Our management team members, through ongoing board service, intend to actively engage with company management. These activities may include: (i) establishing an agenda for management and instilling a sense of accountability and urgency; (ii) aligning the interest of management with growing shareholder value; (iii) providing strategic planning and management consulting assistance, particularly in regards to re-invested capital and growth capital in order to grow revenues, achieve more optimal operating scale or eliminate costs; (iv) establishing measurable key performance metrics; and (v) complementing product lines and brands while growing market share in attractive market categories. These skill sets will be integral to shareholder value creation.\nM&A Expertise and Add-On Acquisitions. Our management team has expertise in identifying, acquiring and integrating synergistic, margin-enhancing and transformational businesses. We intend to, wherever possible, utilize M&A as a strategic tool to strengthen the financial profile of a Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency business we acquire, as well as its competitive positioning. We would seek to enter into accretive Business acquisitions where our management team or an acquired company's management team can seamlessly transition to working together as one organization and team.\nAccess to Portfolio Company Managers and Advisors. Through their combined 32+ year history of investing in and controlling businesses, our management team members have developed strong professional relationships with former company managers and advisors. When appropriate, we intend to bring in outside directors, managers or consultants to assist in corporate governance and operational turnaround activities. The use of supplemental advisors should provide additional resources to management to address time intensive issues that may be delaying an organization from realizing its full potential shareholder returns.\nOur acquisition criteria, due diligence processes and value creation methods are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition with a target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency does not meet the above criteria in our shareholder communications related to our initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition, which, as discussed in this prospectus, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.\nSourcing of Potential Business acquisition Targets\nWe believe that the operational and transactional experience of our management team and their respective affiliates, and the relationships they have developed as a result of such experience, will provide us with a substantial number of potential Business acquisition targets. These individuals and entities have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships around the world. This network has grown through sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses and maintaining relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams. Our management team members have significant experience in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions. We believe that these networks of contacts and relationships and this experience will provide us with important sources of investment opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest noncore assets or divisions.\nOther Acquisition Considerations\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition with a company that is affiliated with our officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm that our initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition is fair to our company from a financial point of view.\nUnless we complete our initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition with an affiliated entity, or our Board of Directors cannot independently determine the fair market value of the target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency or businesses, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or from an independent accounting firm that the price we are paying for a target is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the business judgment of our Board of Directors, which will have significant discretion in choosing the standard used to establish the fair market value of the target or targets, and different methods of valuation may vary greatly in outcome from one another. Such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, related to our initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition.\nMembers of our management team may directly or indirectly own our ordinary shares and/or private placement warrants following this offering, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Business acquisition if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency acquisition.\nIn the future any of our directors and our officers may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present acquisition opportunities to such entity. Accordingly, subject to his or her fiduciary duties, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will need to honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our directors or officers would materially undermine our ability to complete our Business acquisition.\nCorporate Information\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to \u201cemerging growth company\u201d shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.\nCompetition\nBanking, Fintec, Digital Currency and real estate are highly competitive business sectors. Our business is therefore highly competitive. We are in direct competition with more established firms, private investors and management companies. Many management companies offer similar services for business rollups and consolidations. We may be at a substantial disadvantage to our competitors who have more capital than we do to carry out acquisition, operations of Banking, Fintec, Digital Currency and real estate businesses. These competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, larger capital-base, marketing, research and acquisition resources, access to larger customer bases and channel partners, a longer operating history and lower labor and development costs, which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging opportunities and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, acquisition and promotion. For example, we tried but failed twice to acquire businesses in cryptocurrency mining and services. We failed to acquire YCO Bitcoin a Los Angeles based bitcoin ATM operations, Bitcentro and BussMeHome, a Canadian based cryptocurrency mining operation, because our competition were faster at providing the capital required to complete acquisition.\nIncreased competition could result in us failing to attract significant capital or maintaining them. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, our business and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe hope to develop and maintain competitive advantage by keeping abreast of market dynamism that is face by our industry, and by utilizing the experience, knowledge, and expertise of our management team. Moreover, we believe that we distinguish ourselves in the ways our model envisaged transformation of businesses.\nGovernment Regulation\nUntil we acquire a federally licensed bank operation, our activities currently are subject to no particular regulation by governmental agencies other than that routinely imposed on corporate businesses. However, we may be subject to the rules governing acquisition and disposition of businesses, banks, real estates and personal properties in each of the state where we have our operations. We may also be subject to various state laws designed to protect buyers and sellers of businesses. We cannot predict the impact of future regulations on either us or our business model.\nIntellectual Property\nWe currently have no patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property. We do not consider the grant of patents, trademarks or other registered intellectual property essential to the success of our business.\nPlan of Operations\nWhile our major focus is to find, acquire and manage a Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency, our real estate portfolio is still alive and must figure in our plan of operation. As of December 31, 2020, we have one available-for-sale real estate property with a carrying amount of $664,111. We bought three single family residences (SFR) with a cost/carrying amount of $1,452,897, in Los Angeles in 2019. We bought a fourth property in June 2020. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we sold two of the four properties for a total amount of $1,205,000. We also exchanged one property (cost plus rehabilitation $367,121) with the lender for the total amount of debt ($367,121) used to acquire and rehabilitate the property. The exchange had zero impact on our profit and loss for the period. In the next twelve months, we plan on selling the remaining property and adding the proceeds obtained from the sales to other capital for acquisition of real estate, or to finance our Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency business plan.\nThe Company will continue to evaluate its projected expenditures relative to its available cash and to seek additional means of financing in order to satisfy the Company\u2019s working capital and other cash requirements.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to many substantial risks and uncertainties you should consider before deciding to invest in our common stock. These risks are discussed more fully in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Some of these risks include the following:\n\u00b7 We are a rapidly growing company with a relatively limited operating history, which may result in increased risks, uncertainties, expenses and difficulties, and makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects.\n\u00b7 Our revenue growth rate and financial performance in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance and such growth may slow over time.\n\u00b7 The COVID-19 pandemic has harmed and could continue to harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7 If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u00b7 We have incurred net losses in the past, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our profitability in the future.\n\u00b7 Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate and as a result may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\n\u00b7 Risks related to our digital currency initiative, including risks that that the digital currency industry may not gain widespread adoption, that legal and regulatory uncertainty regarding the regulation of digital currencies and digital currency activities may inhibit the growth of the digital currency industry, that our low-cost funding strategy may not be sustainable, that our deposits may be adversely affected by price volatility and that our further development and/or implementation of our solutions and services may not successful;\n\u00b7 risks related to cybersecurity and technology, including risks that our systems may fail or be breached, that we may not have sufficient resources to keep pace with rapid technological change in the financial services industry, that our technology may malfunction and that the third-party service providers we use may experience systems failures;\n\u00b7 risks related to our proposed traditional banking business, including risks that a sustained downturn of the economy in the United States or in California may adversely impact our business, that our competitors may lower their loan rates or underwriting standards, that our risk management practices or allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient and that fluctuations in interest rates and the monetary policies and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve, may negatively impact our business; and\n\u00b7 risks related to regulation, including risks that legislative and regulatory actions may increase our costs and negatively impact our business, that the capital requirements that the Bank and the Company are subject to may limit our activities and that our compliance with anti-money laundering laws may not be adequate to detect or prevent money laundering activities and could subject us to fines or regulatory actions.\n\u00b7 If we are unable to continue to develop and continuously improve our proposed ML-ML- AI models or if our ML-ML- AI models contain errors or are otherwise ineffective, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n\u00b7 If our anticipated bank partners would cease or limit operations with us or if we are unable to attract and onboard new bank partners, our ML-AI lending business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u00b7 The sales and onboarding process of new bank partners could take longer than expected, leading to fluctuations or variability in expected revenues and results of operations.\n\u00b7 Our business may be adversely affected by economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control.\n\u00b7 Our ML- AI models have not yet been tested in any form including during down-cycle economic conditions. If our ML- AI models do not accurately reflect a borrower\u2019s credit risk in such economic conditions, the performance of ML-AI-powered loans may be worse than anticipated.\n\u00b7 If we are unable to maintain a diverse and robust loan funding program, our growth prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u00b7 Our business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7 We rely on strategic relationships with loan aggregators to attract applicants to our platform, and if we cannot maintain effective relationships with loan aggregators or successfully replace their services, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u00b7 Substantially, our revenue would be derived from three main sources comprising, loan product, traditional banking services fees, and platform fees from Blackchain digital currency platform, and we are thus particularly susceptible to fluctuations in the digital currency and personal finance market\n\u00b7 There are other potential difficulties that we might face, including the following:\n\u00b7 Competitors may develop alternatives that render our products redundant or unnecessary;\n\u00b7 We may not obtain and maintain sufficient protection of our Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency models;\n\u00b7 Our Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency products may not become widely accepted by consumers and merchants; and\n\u00b7 We may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds to fully implement our business plan and grow our business.\n\u00b7 Some of the most significant challenges and risks include the following:\n\u00b7 Our limited operating history does not afford investors a sufficient history on which to base an investment decision.\n\u00b7 Our revenues will be dependent upon acceptance of our Bank, Fintec or Digital Currency brand/models and product line by consumers and distributors. The failure of such acceptance will cause us to curtail or cease operations.\n\u00b7 We cannot be certain that we will obtain patents for our product line or that such patents will protect us. Infringement or misappropriation claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from such claims) against us may be asserted or prosecuted, regardless of their merit, and any such assertions or prosecutions may adversely affect our business and/or our operating results.\n\u00b7 The availability of a large number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock may, upon their issuance, lead to dilution of existing stockholders.\n\u00b7 Our stock is thinly traded, sale of your holding may take a considerable amount of time.\nBefore you invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider all the information in this prospectus, including matters set forth under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nInsurance\nWe carry comprehensive general liability coverage on our communities, with limits of liability customary within the multi-family properties industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. We are also insured, with limits of liability customary within the real estate industry, against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period.\nOur primary lines of insurance coverage are property, general liability and workers\u2019 compensation. We believe that our insurance coverages adequately insure our multifamily properties against the risk of loss attributable to fire, earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, terrorism and other perils, and adequately insure us against other risk. Our coverage includes deductibles, retentions and limits that are customary in the industry. We have established loss prevention, loss mitigation, claims handling and litigation management procedures to manage our exposure.\nSeasonality\nOur business has not been, and we do not expect it to become subject to, material seasonal fluctuations.\nEmployees\nWe do not have a W-2 employee at the present. Frank Ikechukwu Igwealor, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is our only full-time staff as of December 31, 2020, pending when we could formalize an employment contract for him. In addition to Mr. Igwealor, we have three part-time unpaid staff who helps with bookkeeping and administrative chores. Most of our part-time staff, officers, and directors will devote their time as needed to our business and are expect to devote at least 15 hours per week to our business operations. We plan on formalizing employment contract for those staff currently helping us without pay. Furthermore, in the immediate future, we intend to use independent contractors and consultants to assist in many aspects of our business on an as needed basis pending financial resources being available. We may use independent contractors and consultants once we receive sufficient funding to hire additional employees. Even then, we will principally rely on independent contractors for substantially all of our technical and marketing needs.\nThe Company has no written employment contract or agreement with any person. Currently, we are not actively seeking additional employees or engaging any consultants through a formal written agreement or contract. Services are provided on an as-needed basis to date. This may change in the event that we are able to secure financing through equity or loans to the Company. As our company grows, we expect to hire more full-time employees.\nWhere You Can Find Us\nThe Company\u2019s principal executive office and mailing address is at 370 Amapola Ave., Suite 200-A, Torrance, California 90501.\nTelephone: 310-895-1839.\nWhere You Can Find More Information\nWe have restarted filing annual, quarterly, and special reports, proxy statements, and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). Our SEC filings are available to the public over the Internet from the SEC\u2019s website at http://www.sec.gov. You may also read and copy any document we file at the SEC\u2019s public reference room in Washington, D.C. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the public reference room. You can also access these reports and other filings electronically on the SEC\u2019s web site, www.sec.gov.\nOur Filing Status as a \u201cSmaller Reporting Company\u201d\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $75 million and annual revenues of less than $50 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings are less than it would be if we were not considered a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d Specifically, \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to conduct say-on-pay and frequency votes until annual meetings occurring on or after January 21, 2013; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, being permitted to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports rather than three years. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial prospects.\nImplications of Being an Emerging Growth Company\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:\n\u25cf\nA requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related MD&A;\n\u25cf\nExemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d);\n\u25cf\nReduced disclosure about the emerging growth company\u2019s executive compensation arrangements; and\n\u25cf\nNo non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.\nWe have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this Prospectus, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cAct\u201d) for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, which allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements contained in this Form S-1 may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. The existing scaled executive compensation disclosure requirements for smaller reporting companies will continue to apply to our filings for so long as our Company is an emerging growth company, regardless of whether the Company remains a smaller reporting company.\nWe could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\nFor more details regarding this exemption, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies.\u201d",

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources.\nYou should read the following description of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report beginning on page.\nThis section includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cproject\u201d and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.\nBusiness Overview\nGiveMePower Corporation operates and manages a portfolio of real estate and financial services assets and operations to empower black persons in the United States through financial tools and resources. Givemepower is primarily focused on: (1) creating and empowering local black businesses in urban America; and (2) creating real estate properties and businesses in opportunity zones and other distressed neighborhood across America. This Offering represents the commencement of the Banking and financial services division of our business. This Offering will enable GMPW to become a financial technology company (FINTEC) business that (1) one-to-four branch federally licensed bank in each jurisdiction, (2) a machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) enabled loan and insurance underwriting platform, (3) blockchain-powered transaction processing and payment systems, (4) cryptocurrency transaction processing platform, and (5) emerging cryptocurrency opportunities portfolio; giving access to the unbanked, underserved residents of majorly black communities across the United State. This is the fulfillment of mission of operating and managing a portfolio of real estate and financial services assets and operations to empower black persons in the United States through financial tools and resources, with a primary focused on: (1) creating and empowering local black businesses in urban America; and (2) creating real estate properties and businesses in opportunity zones and other distressed neighborhood across America. Our FINTEC operations would cover the basic areas of traditional banking-digitally enhance, MLand Ai enabled lending and insurance underwriting, areas of private equity, business lending and venture capital that invest in young black entrepreneurs, and seeding their viable business plans/ideas on block-chain-powered financial services delivery platform that connects, black entrepreneurs, black borrowers, consumers, banks, and institutional investors. Our real estate division invests in Opportunity Zones, Affordable Housing, and specialized real estate properties.\nCorporate History\nGiveMePower Corporation (the \u201cPubCo\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d), a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on June 7, 2001 to sell software geared to end users and developers involved in the design, manufacture, and construction of engineered products located in Canada and the United States. GiveMePower was originally incorporated in Alberta, Canada as GiveMePower.com Inc. on April 18, 2000, to sell software and web-based services geared to businesses involved in the design, manufacture, and construction of engineered products throughout North America. Effective September 15, 2000, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its corporate name to GiveMePower Inc. The founder of the Company began the implementation of this business plan under his 100%-owned private company, Sundance Marketing International Inc. (Sundance). Sundance has been in existence since 1991 and at one time was a market leader in the distribution of survey, mapping and infrastructure design software in the Canadian marketplace. On April 15, 1999, Mr. Walton entered into a license agreement with Felix Computer Aided Technologies GmbH (Felix) for the exclusive rights to distribute FCAD software in North America.\nOn December 20, 2000, the Company entered into a Plan and Agreement of Reorganization to undertake a reverse merger with a National Quotation Bureau public company called TelNet World Communications, Inc. (TelNet). TelNet was originally incorporated in the State of Utah on March 10, 1972 as Tropic Industries, Inc. (Tropic). Tropic became United Datacopy, Incorporated on February 24, 1987 which became Pen International, Inc. on March 21, 1994 and then TelNet World Communications, Inc. on March 4, 1998. TelNet had no operations nor any working capital when the Company entered into the reverse merger with it. GMP acquired the rights, title and interest to the domain name, givemepower.com from Sundance on February 16, 2001. In addition, Sundance agreed to assign its existing customer base to GMP and further agreed that it would terminate its license agreement with Felix immediately upon GMP securing its own agreement with Felix. GMP renegotiated the exclusive rights to co-develop, re-brand and distribute FCAD software in North America effective February 16, 2001. Effective July 5, 2001 the Company changed the name of TelNet to GiveMePower Corporation and changed the domicile from Utah to Nevada.\nThe PubCo has been dormant and non-operating since year 2009. PubCo is a public reporting company registered with the Securities Exchange Commissioner (\u201cSEC\u201d). In November 2009, the Company filed Form 15D, Suspension of Duty to Report, and as a result, the Company was not required to file any SEC forms since November 2009.\nOn December 31, 2019, PubCo sold one Special 2019 series A preferred share (\u201cSeries A Share\u201d) for $38,000 to Goldstein Franklin, Inc. (\u201cGoldstein\u201d), a California corporation. One Series A Share is convertible to 100,000,000 shares of common stocks at any time. The Series A Share also provided with 60% voting rights of the PubCo. On the same day, Goldstein sold one-member unit of Alpharidge Capital, LLC (\u201cAlpharidge\u201d), a California limited liability corporation, representing 100% member owner of Alpharidge. As a result, Alpharidge become a wholly owned subsidiary of PubCo as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Company\u2019s operating structure did not change as a result of the change of control, however, following the transaction on December 31, 2019, in which Goldstein Franklin, Inc. acquired control of the Company, Goldstein transferred one of its operating subsidiaries, Alpharidge Capital LLC into GMPW to become one of the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries. As the result of above transaction, Alpharidge Capital LLC became the Company\u2019s wholly owned operating subsidiary of the Company.\nAlpharidge Capital LLC (\u201cAlpharidge\u201d) was formed under the laws of the State of California on August 30, 2019. Alpharidge has two distinct lines of businesses that comprise: (1) a specialty biopharmaceutical holding company focused on building portfolio of real estate investment properties and equity positions in select companies within select industries; and (2) an event-driven investment management operation that invests in equities, warrants, bonds and options of public and private companies in America and across the globe.\nOn September 16, 2020, as part of its sales of unregistered securities to Kid Castle Educational Corporation, company related to, and controlled by GMPW President and CEO, the Company, for $3 in cash and 1,000,000 shares of its preferred stock, acquired 100% interest in, and control of Community Economic Development Capital, LLC (\u201cCED Capital\u201d), a California Limited Liability Company, and 97% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (\u201cCBDX\u201d), a California corporation. This transaction was accounted for under the Consolidation Method using the variable interest entity (VIE) model wherein the Company consolidates all investees operating results if the Company expects to assume more than 50% of another entity\u2019s expected losses or gains. The 1,000,000 shares of our preferred stock sold to Kid Castle Educational Corporation gave to Kid Castle, approximately 87% voting control of Givemepower Corporation.\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company therefore include its wholly owned subsidiaries of Alpharidge Capital LLC. (\u201cAlpharidge\u201d), Community Economic Development Capital, LLC. (\u201cCED Capital\u201d), and Cannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (\u201cCBDX\u201d), and subsidiaries, in which GiveMePower has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d) provisions of ASC 810, \u201cConsolidation\u201d (\u201cASC 810\u201d), after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts.\nCurrent Business and Organization - Alpharidge\nThe Company, through its three wholly owned subsidiaries, Alpharidge Capital, LLC (\u201cAlpharidge\u201d), Malcom Wingate Cush Franklin LLC (\u201cMWCF\u201d), and Opportunity Zone Capital LLC (\u201cOZC\u201d), seeks to empower black persons in the United States through financial tools and resources as follows:\n\u00b7 Alpharidge and OZC Real estate operations - Real estate operations would consist primarily of rental real estate, affordable housing projects, opportunity zones, other property development and associated HOA activities. OZC development operations would be primarily through a real estate investment, management and development subsidiary that focuses primarily on the construction and sale of single-family and multi-family homes, lots in subdivisions and planned communities, and raw land for residential development; and\n\u00b7 MWCF financial empowerment - MWCF would utilize operate the tools of financial education/training, mergers and acquisitions, private equity and business lending to invest and empower young black entrepreneurs, seeding their viable business plans and ideas and creating jobs in their communities. MWCF is primarily focused on: (1) creating and empowering local black businesses in urban America; and (2) creating real estate in opportunity zones and other distressed neighborhood across America.\n\u00b7 Cash Management, Opportunistic and Event-Driven Investments: The Company keeps no more than 10% of its total assets in liquid cash or investments portfolio, which is actively managed by its directors and officers and invest primarily in equity investments on a long and short basis. The Company\u2019s cash management policy which requires that the Company actively invests its excess cash into stocks, bonds and other securities is intended to provide the company greater levels of liquidity and current income. The Company uses proprietary trading models to capitalize on real-time market anomalies and generate ongoing income in the forms similar to hedge funds. Where necessary, the Company uses seeded entities to pursue real-time market transactions in publicly traded securities including but not limited to stocks, bonds, options, futures, forex, warrants, and other instruments.\nCurrent Business and Organization - CED Capital\nCommunity Economic Development Capital, LLC. (\u201cCED Capital\u201d), a California limited liability company, is a specialty real estate holding company for specialized assets including, affordable housing, opportunity zones properties, industrial and commercial real estate, and other real estate related services. CED Capital principal business objective is to maximize returns through a combination of (1) generating good profit while making substantial social impact, (2) sustainable long-term growth in cash flows from increased rents, and (3) potential long-term appreciation in the value of its properties from capital gains upon future sale. The Company is engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, acquisition, development and redevelopment of predominantly multifamily housing and specialized industrial properties in the United States. Additionally, its specialized industrial property strategy is to acquire and own a portfolio of specialized industrial properties, including multifamily properties. This strategy includes the following components:\n\uf0b7\nOwning Specialized Real Estate Properties and Assets for Income. The Company intends to acquire multifamily housings, economic development real estates and multifamily properties. The Company expects to hold acquired properties for investment and to generate stable and increasing rental income from leasing these properties to licensed growers.\n\uf0b7\nOwning Specialized Real Estate Properties and Assets for Appreciation. The Company intends to lease its acquired properties under long-term, triple-net leases. However, from time to time, the Company may elect to sell one or more properties if the Company believes it to be in the best interests of its stockholders. Accordingly, the Company will seek to acquire properties that it believes also have potential for long-term appreciation in value.\n\uf0b7\nAffordable Housing. Its motto is: \u201cacquiring distressed/troubled properties, securing generous government subsidies, empowering low-income families, and generating above-market returns to investors.\u201d\n\uf0b7\nPreserving Financial Flexibility on the Company\u2019s Balance Sheet. The Company intends to focus on maintaining a conservative capital structure, in order to provide us flexibility in financing its growth initiatives.\nCurrent Business and Organization - CBDX\nCannabinoid Biosciences, Inc. (\u201cCBDZ\u201d), a California corporation was incorporated on May 6, 2014, to operate as a biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical holding company that engages in the discovery, development, and commercialization of cures and novel therapeutics from cannabinoid, cannabidiol, endocannabinoids, phytocannabinoids, and synthetic cannabinoids product platform suitable for specific treatments in a broad range of disease areas. CBDZ engages in biopharmaceutical research and development operation with aim of identifying viable drug candidates to go into clinical trials and if successful, be submitted to the FDA for approval.\nBlackBank, Blockchain-Powered Fintech, Ai and ML Enabled Lending, and CryptoCurrency Deals\nThe Company intends to actualize its banking and financial services operations goals through acquisition and management of (1) a one-to-four branch bank that is federally licensed in each jurisdiction; (2) a machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (Ai) enabled loan and insurance underwriting platform; (3) blockchain-powered transaction processing and payment systems; (4) cryptocurrency transaction processing platform; and (5) emerging cryptocurrency opportunities portfolio; a combination of three of which would connects consumers, banks, institutional investors, and ensure access to the unbanked and underserved residents of majorly black communities across the United State of America.\n(1) BlackBank - Proposed Federally licensed one-four branch bank\nJurisdictionally, GMPW intend to acquire and manage one-four branch bank in each of its relevant jurisdictional domain. Owning/controlling a bank or banks with branches across every urban/black neighborhood in the United States is not our goal. Rather we would be content to own a one-four branch bank in every relevant jurisdiction to allow us to initiate/conduct ML-Ai enabled and blockchain-powered digitized banking that is accessible to all black person and businesses across the United States. We intend to start our banking acquisition by finding targets that operates one-four branches. We intend to start with the acquisition of one-four branch bank, whose operation and back-office would be migrated unto a Blockchain-powered platform to digitize its entire banking operation to cover and serve all black persons in the United States. We believe that blockchain technology is one of the most suited platform to implement, run and manage a U.S. wide digitized banking services whose reach encompasses most black persons living in the United States.\n(2) Machine-Learning and Ai (AI) Enabled Lending and Insurance Underwriting Platform\nOnce it has raised sufficient capital (proposed $10 million offering), the Company intends to launch the Company\u2019s cloud-based machine learning and artificial intelligence lending platform. It is our believe that Machine-Learning (ML) and Artificial intelligence (AI), lending and insurance underwriting platform would enable a superior loan product with improved economics that can be shared between consumers and lenders. The proposed platform would aggregate consumer demand for high-quality loans and connects it to our soon-to-be-build network of ML-AI-enabled investors, lenders and bank partners. Consumers on the ML-AI platform would benefit from a highly automated, efficient, all-digital experience. Our prospective bank partners would benefit from access to new customers, lower fraud and loss rates, and increased automation throughout the lending process.\nCredit is a cornerstone of the U.S. economy, and access to affordable credit is central to unlocking upward mobility and opportunity. The FICO score was invented in 1989 and remains the standard for determining who is approved for credit and at what interest rate. (Rob Kaufman, myFico Blog: The History of the FICO Score, August 2018). While FICO is rarely the only input in a lending decision, most banks use simple, rules-based systems that consider only a limited number of variables. Unfortunately, because legacy credit systems fail to properly identify and quantify risk, millions of creditworthy individuals are left out of the system, and millions more pay too much to borrow money. (Patrice Ficklin and Paul Watkins, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Blog: An Update on Credit Access and the Bureau\u2019s First No-Action Letter, August 2019).\nThe first generation of online lenders focused on bringing credit online. Analogous to earlier internet pioneers, these companies made shopping for and accessing credit simpler and easier for consumers and businesses. It was no longer necessary to stand in line at a bank branch, to sit across the desk from a loan officer and to wait weeks or months for a decision. These lenders enabled the emergence of personal loan products that were previously unprofitable for banks to offer. While they brought the credit process online, they inherited the decision frameworks that banks had used for decades and did not address the more rewarding and challenging opportunity of reinventing the credit decision.\nGMPW intend to leverage the power of AI to more accurately quantify the true risk of a loan. The ML- AI models would be built to continuously self-upgrade, train and refine many critical components of lending risk analytics and decision-making on a real-time basis. We intend to build discrete ML- AI models that target fee optimization, income fraud, acquisition targeting, loan stacking, prepayment prediction, identity fraud and time-delimited default prediction. These models would be designed to incorporate multiple lending underwriting variables and utilize training dataset that accounts for varieties of repayment events. It is also anticipated that the network effects generated by constantly improving ML- AI models would provide a significant competitive advantage-and more training data would lead to higher approval rates and lower interest rates at the same loss rate\n(3) Blockchain-Powered Digital Currency Payment and Financial Transactions Processing platform (\u201cBlackchain\u201d)\nThe Company intends to acquire an existing, or build-from-the-scratch, a Blockchain-Powered Digital Currency Payment and Financial Transactions Processing platform (\u201cBlackchain\u201d), with home in the BlackBank alongside the ML-AI lending platform. Blockchain-powered Payment and Financial Transactions Processing platform would also provide efficient and inexpensive payment platform and merchant services to black businesses across the United States.\nThe company would establish an exchange network called Blackchain Exchange Network (\u201cBEN\u201d), a Payment and Financial Transactions Processing platform, would be a wholly-owned subsidiary, the BlackBank. We believe Blackchain would be a leading provider of innovative financial infrastructure solutions and services to participants in the nascent and expanding digital currency industry. Blackchain business strategy is floating a Blackchain Exchange Network, or BEN, a virtually instantaneous payment network for participants in the digital currency industry which would serve as a platform for the development of additional products and services. The BEN would have a network effect that would make it valuable as participants and utilization increase, leading to good growth in BEN transaction volumes. The BEN would enable the BlackBank to prioritize, build and significantly grow noninterest bearing deposit product for digital currency industry participants, which is expected to provide the majority of our bank funding in the next two years from finalizing acquisition. This unique source of funding would be a distinctive advantage over most traditional financial institutions and allows BlackBank to generate revenue from a conservative portfolio of investments in cash, short term securities and ML-Ai enabled loans that we believe generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition, use of the BEN would result in an increase in noninterest income that we believe will become a valuable source of additional future revenue as we develop and deploy blockchain-powered, fee-based solutions in connection with our digital currency initiative. We would also evaluate additional products or product enhancements specifically targeted at providing further financial infrastructure solutions to our customers and strengthening BEN network effects.\nBlackchain Business Overview\nOnce acquired, the Federally licensed one-four branch bank would be such that is already providing banking and financial services including commercial banking, business lending, commercial and residential real estate lending and mortgage warehouse lending, all funded primarily by interest bearing deposits and borrowings. To that up and running banking and financial services operation, we intend to insert a Blockchain-powered payment and transaction processing system and digital currency platform. We intend to pursue digital currency customers and bring them into the BlackBank to bank with us using digital currency. We believe we could effectively leverage the traditional commercial bank platform, the ML-Ai enabled lending platform and the attributes of the BEN to gain traction in the digital currency banking industry.\nWe intend to focus on the digital currency initiative as the core of our future strategy and direction. We intend to build a leadership position in the digital currency industry as a result of the BEN to enable us to establish a significant balance of noninterest bearing deposits from digital currency customer base. Over several post-acquisition years, BlackBank would have transitioned from a traditional asset based bank model focused on loan generation to a deposit and solutions based model focused on increasing noninterest bearing deposits and noninterest income. This emphasis on noninterest bearing deposits and noninterest income, is primarily associated with digital currency, will likely result in a significant shift in BlackBank\u2019s asset composition with a greater percentage consisting of liquid assets such as interest earning deposits in other banks and investment securities, and a corresponding decrease in the percentage of loans. Most of our actions would be focused on developing and delivering highly scalable and operationally efficient solutions for BlackBank\u2019s digital currency customers.\n(4) Emerging Cryptocurrency Opportunities Portfolio\nThe emerging cryptocurrency opportunities portfolio is the wildcard of our FINTEC business model. While the goals are clear, because it is a wildcard, there is no outline on what to expect or how it should be run. GMPW needs these flexibilities because many established companies are jumping into the crypocurrency opportunities on a minutes notice. For example, in 2020, Microstrategy decided to move their treasury into bitcoin as part of their cash management strategy. Marathon Patent Group moved into cryptocurrency mining as a business model. Overstock has been in cryptocurrency for a while. Square and Paypal just joined the bandwagon of American companies that try to find and exploit opportunities in the crypto currency industry without abandoning their actual businesses. GMPW\u2019s emerging cryptocurrency opportunities portfolio would not be different. The company would on an ongoing basis evaluate and consider investments into potentially viable cryptocurrency opportunities anywhere.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019\nRevenue\nWe are generating substantially all our revenue from sales of real estate investment property and our proprietary trading operation. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue from real estate sales was $1,205,000 and revenue from proprietary trading was $423,136 for a total revenue of $1,628,136. Compared to proprietary trading revenue of $464 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenue is totally related to the cost of acquiring the real estate investment property and the trading securities sold. Cost related to our real estate investment property and the trading securities sold for the year December 31, 2020 were $1,179,827 and 374,691 respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expense for the year was $159,463. Operating expense consists of costs related to the establishment of corporate governances; and costs associated with our plans and preparations for a future potential capital raise. These expenses also include the costs of conducting market research, attending and/or participating in industry conferences and seminars, business development activities, and professional fees, other general business outside consulting activities. Operating expense also includes travel costs, for third-party consultants, legal and accounting fees and other professional and administrative costs.\nWe expect that our operating expenses will increase in the future as we add to our personnel and expand our infrastructure to support the requirements of being a public company.\nNet Loss\nNet Loss for the year was $82,980.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe following individuals and entities have been identified as related parties based on their affiliation with our CEO and director, Frank I Igwealor:\nFrank I Igwealor\nGoldstein Franklin, Inc.\nThe following amounts were owed to related parties, affiliated with the CEO and Chairman of the Board, at the dates indicated:\n31-Dec-20\n31-Dec-19\nLos Angeles Community Capital (controlled by Frank I Igwealor)\n$\n540,524\n$\n-\nGoldstein Franklin Inc (controlled by Frank I Igwealor)\n$\n63,632\n$\n41,200\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $500 cash on hand. We anticipate that our cash position is not sufficient to fund current operations. We have limited lending relationships with commercial banks and are dependent upon the completion of one or more financings or equity raises to fund our continuing operations. We anticipate that we will seek additional capital through debt or equity financings. While we are aggressively pursuing financing, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our capital raising efforts. Any additional equity financing may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nSince 2019, all of our operations have been financed through advances from a company controlled by our president and CEO. As of December 31, 2020, the company controlled by our president and CEO has loaned $604,156 to us, with no formal commitments or arrangements to advance or loan any additional funds to us in the future. We have not yet achieved significant profitability. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase and, as a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve significant profitability. We may never achieve significant profitability.\nThe revenues, if any, generated from our operations or acquisitions may not be sufficient to fund our operations or planned growth. We will require additional capital to continue to operate our business, and to further expand our business. Sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements with third parties may include equity or debt financing, bank loans or revolving credit facilities. We may not be successful in locating suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at all, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means.\nWe will now be obligated to file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d) and the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities of ours more time- consuming and costly. In order to meet the needs to comply with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, we will need investment of capital.\nManagement has determined that additional capital will be required in the form of equity or debt securities. There is no assurance that management will be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to the Company. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may have to cease filing the required reports and cease operations completely. If we obtain additional funds by selling any of our equity securities or by issuing common stock to pay current or future obligations, the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be reduced, shareholders may experience additional dilution, or the equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the common stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time-to-time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies, relating to the treatment and recording of certain accounting transactions. Unless otherwise discussed herein, management of the Company has determined that these recent accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management\u2019s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements which we have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\nCritical accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material.\nThese significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nManagement regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 of our annual financial statements included in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company utilizes ASC 820-10, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure, for valuing financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company\u2019s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. The guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nFinancial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.\nTransactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm\u2019s-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm\u2019s-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award. For employees and directors, the fair value of the award is measured on the grant date and for non-employees, the fair value of the award is generally re-measured on vesting dates and interim financial reporting dates until the service period is complete. The fair value amount is then recognized over the period during which services are required to be provided in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded by us in the same expense classifications in the consolidated statements of operations, as if such amounts were paid in cash.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Income Taxes Provision\nThe Company adopted the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under paragraph 740-10-25-13, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Paragraph 740-10-25-13 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of paragraph 740-10-25-13.\nThe estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.\nManagement makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In management\u2019s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.\nManagement assumes that the realization of the Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carry-forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses and presently has no revenue-producing business; (b) general economic conditions; and, (c) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering, among other factors.\nSeasonality\nAlthough our operating history is limited, we do not consider our business to be seasonal.\nCommercial Real Property\nAs at December 31, 2020, the Company has no commercial real estate.\nLine of Credit\nAs at December 31, 2020, we have on our book $63,632 classified as long-term debt. This debt is from an interest-free line of credit from a related party.",

BUSINESS\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nGeneral\ntheglobe.com, inc. (the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201ctheglobe,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated on May 1, 1995 and commenced operations on that date. Originally, we were an online community with registered members and users in the United States and abroad. On September 29, 2008, we consummated the sale of the business and substantially all of the assets of our subsidiary, Tralliance Corporation (\u201cTralliance\u201d), to Tralliance Registry Management Company, LLC (\u201cTralliance Registry Management\u201d), an entity controlled by Michael S. Egan, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result of and on the effective date of the sale of our Tralliance business, which was our last remaining operating business, we became a \u201cshell company,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, with no material operations or assets.\nOn December 20, 2017, Delfin Midstream LLC (\u201cDelfin\u201d) entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with certain of our stockholders for the purchase of a total of 312,825,952 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (\u201cCommon Stock\u201d), representing approximately 70.9% of our Common Stock.\nAs a shell company, our operating expenses have consisted primarily of, and we expect them to continue to consist primarily of, customary public company expenses, including personnel, accounting, financial reporting, legal, audit and other related public company costs.\nAs of December 31, 2020, as reflected in our accompanying Balance Sheet, our current liabilities exceed our total assets. We prefer to avoid filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. However, unless we are successful in raising additional funds through the offering of debt or equity securities, we may not be able to continue to operate as a going concern for any significant length of time in the future. Notwithstanding the above, we currently intend to continue operating as a public company and make all the requisite filings under the Exchange Act.\nEMPLOYEES\nAs of March 1, 2021, we had no employees. Our executive officer currently devotes very limited time to our business and receives no compensation from us. Our executive officer is an officer, director and/or stockholder of other companies which may have ongoing business relationships with the Company. See the section in this annual report entitled \u201c",
    "item_7": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nAs a shell company, we currently have no material operations or assets.\nBasis of Presentation of Financial Statements; Going Concern\nWe received a report from our independent registered public accountants, relating to our December 31, 2020 audited financial statements, containing an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. As a shell company, our management believes that we will not be able to generate operating cash flows sufficient to fund our operations and pay our existing current liabilities in the foreseeable future. Based upon our current limited cash resources and without the infusion of additional capital and/or the continued forbearance of our creditors, our management does not believe we can operate as a going concern beyond the next twelve months. See \u201cFuture and Critical Need for Capital\u201d section of this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further details.\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, our financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nAll Note references relate to accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNet Revenue\nCommensurate with the sale of our Tralliance business on September 29, 2008, we became a shell company, and have not had any material operations since then. As a result, net revenue was $0 for both of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include only those customary public company expenses, including outside legal and audit fees, insurance and other related public company costs. General and administrative expenses totaled approximately $118,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $178,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to less legal fees and no proxy mailing fees in the current year as compared to prior year.\nRelated Party Interest Expense\nRelated party interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $46,000 and $34,000, respectively, and consisted of interest due and payable to Delfin under the Bridge Note. The increase is due to an increase in the amount of money borrowed from Delfin.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately $164,000 as compared to a net loss of approximately $211,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFuture and Critical Need for Capital\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. However, for the reasons described below, our management does not believe that cash on hand and cash flow generated internally by us will be adequate to fund our limited overhead and other cash requirements beyond the next twelve months. These reasons raise significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, the COVID 19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our ability to continue operating. Please see Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nIn March 2018, the Company executed a Promissory Note with Delfin, which was amended and restated in May 2018 to $150,000, in November 2018 to $350,000, in June 2019 to $465,000, in November 2019 to $554,100, in August 2020 to $600,000, and then again in February 2021 to increase the principal amount to up to $637,500 to pay certain accrued expenses, accounts payable and to allow the Company to have working capital. Interest accrues on the unpaid principal balance at a rate of 8% per annum, calculated on a 365/66 day year, as applicable. The Promissory Note is due upon demand. It may be prepaid in whole or in any part at any time prior to demand. The Company expects continued funding from Delfin over the next twelve months.\nDelfin, the Company\u2019s majority stockholder, has continued to fund the Company through loans to the Company (see Note 3). At December 31, 2020, the Company had a net working capital deficit of approximately $707,000. This deficit included accrued expenses of approximately $24,000, accounts payable of approximately $2,000 and approximately $689,000 in principal and accrued interest owed under the Promissory Note with Delfin.\nCash Flow Items\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $7,624 in cash as compared to $86,961 as of December 31, 2019. The decrease is due to timing of funding. We receive funding, then use most of those funds prior to receiving more funding. Net cash flows used in operating activities totaled approximately $125,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to cash flows used in operating activities of approximately $173,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities totaled approximately $46,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $254,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due in part to timimg of funding, but also due to a significant decrease in legal costs, requiring less cash.\nContractual Obligations\nAs a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we have elected scaled disclosure reporting and therefore are not required to provide the table required by (a)(5) of this Item.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our current or future financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.\nEffects of Inflation\nManagement believes that inflation has not had a significant effect on our results of operations during 2020 and 2019.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These include valuations of accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nImpact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards\nManagement has determined that all recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on our financial statements or do not apply to our operations.",
    "item_10": "Item 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe following table sets forth the names, ages and current positions with the Company held by our Directors and Executive Officers.\nNAME\nAGE\nPOSITION OR OFFICE WITH THE COMPANY\nDIRECTOR SINCE\nFrederick Jones\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer, Chief\nFinancial Officer and Director\nJune 29, 2018\nWe are not aware of any arrangement or understanding between Mr. Jones and any other person pursuant to which he was elected or appointed to his current positions. Neither Mr. Jones nor any immediate family member of Mr. Jones has been a participant in any transaction or currently proposed transaction with the Company that is reportable under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.\nDue to his status as material stockholder of Delfin, which is our controlling stockholder, and his willingness to serve without compensation, we believe Mr. Jones is in the best position to serve as our director until such time that our controlling stockholder determines the direction of the Company.\nFrederick Jones, 73, has been involved in international commodity trading, energy infrastructure, real estate, and oil and gas businesses for approximately 47 years. Mr. Jones was one of the early investors in U.S. shale gas. For approximately the past seven (7) years, Mr. Jones has served, and continues to serve, as the Chief Executive Officer of Fairwood Peninsula Energy Corporation (\u201cFairwood\u201d), a midstream liquefied natural gas company. Fairwood is a material stockholder of our controlling stockholder, Delfin Midstream, Inc. (\u201cDelfin\u201d). Mr. Jones was a founder of Fairwood and is currently a material Delfin stockholder. In 2019, Mr. Jones became the CEO of Energy Global Services FZE and Asiatic Gas Energy Holdings Limited, two companies privately owned by Mr. Jones and that primarily handle Mr. Jones\u2019 private investments. He was also a founding stockholder in Marc Rich + Co A.G., Switzerland, now known as Glencore Plc.\nMr. Jones will serve as a director until the next annual meeting of stockholders of the Company and until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his earlier death, resignation or removal.\nCompliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file certain reports regarding ownership of, and transactions in, our securities with the SEC. Such officers, directors, and 10% stockholders are also required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file.\nBased solely on our review of copies of Forms 3 and 4 and any amendments furnished to us pursuant to Rule 16a-3(e) and any written representations referred to in Item 405(b)(2)(i) of Regulation S-K stating that no Forms 5 were required, we believe that, during the 2020 fiscal year, our officers, directors and all persons owning more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities have complied with all Section 16(a) applicable filing requirements.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our officers, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and any other persons performing similar functions. The Code of Ethics will be provided free of charge by the Company to interested parties upon request. Requests should be made in writing and directed to the Company at the following address: 14643 Dallas Parkway, Suite 650, Dallas, TX 75254, Attention: Frederick Jones.\nBoard Meetings\nIncluding unanimous written actions of the Board, the Board met 2 times in 2020\nCommittees\nOur Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. As a shell company, we believe that it is not necessary to have such committees at this time because the Board can adequately perform the functions of such committees.\nAudit. We believe that our Board can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. As a smaller reporting company with no material operations or assets, and due to the lack of financial resources available to us, we do not have a Board member that qualifies as an \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as \u201cindependent\u201d within the meaning of applicable Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards, including any heightened independence requirements specific to audit committee members. We believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given our lack of material operations or assets.\nCompensation. Because the Company currently has no material operations and none of its executive officers in 2020 received a salary, we do not believe it is necessary to have a compensation committee at this time. We believe that our Board can adequately perform the functions of a compensation committee. Due to his status as an officer of the Company, our sole director is not \u201cindependent\u201d within the meaning of applicable Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards, including any heightened independence requirements specific to compensation committee members.\nDirector Nominations. As noted above, the Board does not have a separate nominating committee. Rather, our Board considers and nominates directors for election. We do not believe the Company would derive any significant benefit from a separate nominating committee. Due to his status as an officer of the Company, our sole director is not \u201cindependent\u201d as defined in the applicable Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards.\nIn recommending director candidates in the future (including director candidates recommended by stockholders), the Board intends to take into consideration such factors as it deems appropriate based on the Company\u2019s current needs. These factors may include diversity, age, skills, decision-making ability, inter-personal skills, experience with businesses and other organizations of comparable size, community activities and relationships, and the interrelationship between the candidate\u2019s experience and business background, and other Board members\u2019 experience and business background, whether such candidate would be considered \u201cindependent,\u201d as such term is defined in the Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards, as well as the candidate\u2019s ability to devote the required time and effort to serve on the Board.\nThe Board will consider for nomination by the Board director candidates recommended by stockholders if the stockholders comply with the following requirements. Under our By-Laws, if a stockholder wishes to nominate a director at the annual meeting, we must receive the stockholder\u2019s written notice not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the date of the annual meeting, unless we give our stockholders less than 70 days\u2019 notice of the date of our annual meeting. If we provide less than 70 days\u2019 notice, then we must receive the stockholder\u2019s written notice by the close of business on the 10th day after we provide notice of the date of the annual meeting. The notice must contain the specific information required in our By-Laws. A copy of our By-Laws may be obtained by writing to the Company. If we receive a stockholder\u2019s proposal within the time periods required under our By-Laws, we may choose, but are not required, to include it in our proxy statement. If we do, we may tell the other stockholders what we think of the proposal, and how we intend to use our discretionary authority to vote on the proposal. All proposals should be made in writing and sent via registered, certified or express mail, to our executive offices, 14643 Dallas Parkway, Suite 650, Dallas, TX 75254 Attention: Frederick Jones.\nStockholder Communications with the Board of Directors. Any stockholder who wishes to send communications to the Board should mail them addressed to the intended recipient by name or position in care of: theglobe.com, inc., 14643 Dallas Parkway, Suite 650, Dallas, TX 75254 Attention: Frederick Jones. Upon receipt of any such communications, Mr. Jones will determine the identity of the intended recipient and whether the communication is an appropriate stockholder communication. Then Mr. Jones will send all appropriate stockholder communications to the intended recipient. An \u201cappropriate stockholder communication\u201d is a communication from a person claiming to be a stockholder in the communication, the subject of which relates solely to the sender\u2019s interest as a stockholder and not to any other personal or business interest.\nIn the case of communications addressed to the Board, the Company will send appropriate stockholder communications to the Board. In the case of communications addressed to any particular directors, the Company will send appropriate stockholder communications to such director.\nAttendance at Annual Meetings\nThe Board encourages, but does not require, its directors to attend the Company\u2019s annual meeting of stockholders. The Company did not hold an annual meeting last year."

    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nThe Company\nWe are an Internet security software and technology company with patented technology for various types of secure network communications, including 5G and 4G LTE network security. Our patented Secure Domain Name Registry and GABRIEL Connection Technology\u2122, are the foundation for our GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform\u2122 that protects communications using Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA). Our technology generates secure connections on a \u201czero-click\u201d or \u201csingle-click\u201d basis, significantly simplifying the deployment of secure real-time communication solutions by eliminating the need for end-users to enter any encryption information. Our portfolio of intellectual property is the foundation of our business model. We currently own approximately 194 total patents and pending applications, including 70 U.S. patents/patent applications and 124 foreign patents/validations/pending applications. Our patent portfolio is primarily focused on securing real-time communications over the Internet, and related services, and is used in all our technology and products, some of which were acquired by our principal operating subsidiary; VirnetX, Inc., from Leidos, Inc., or Leidos, (f/k/a Science Applications International Corporation, or SAIC) in 2006.\nOur product portfolio includes sophisticated technologies, products and services that are available for sale worldwide. Our GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform\u2122 includes a set of software libraries with application interfaces available for securing third-party applications seamlessly across multiple operating systems. It enables individuals and organizations to maintain complete ownership and control over their personal and confidential data, secured within their own private network, while enabling authorized secure encrypted access from anywhere at any time.\nOur GABRIEL Gateway product extends our Secure Communication Platform\u2122 by allowing existing networked devices and services to seamlessly join the \u201cGABRIEL SECURED\u201d network without requiring any modifications. All these devices or services, including on-premise or cloud-based services, can now be assigned a VirnetX Secure Domain Name and use fully authenticated, secure communication channels for its communications.\nOur GABRIEL Collaboration Suite\u2122 is a set of communication applications and tools that use our GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform\u2122. It enables seamless and secure cross-platform communications between devices that are enrolled in our \u201cGABRIEL SECURED\u201d network and have our software installed. Our GABRIEL Collaboration Suite\u2122 is available for download and free trial, for Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X platforms, at https://virnetx.com.\nWe continue to enhance our products and add new functionality. We will provide updates to new and existing customers as they are released to the public. Many small and medium businesses have installed our GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform\u2122 and GABRIEL Collaboration Suite\u2122 products in their corporate networks. We intend to continue to expand our customer base with targeted promotions and direct sales initiatives.\nWe have an ongoing GABRIEL Licensing Program under which we offer licenses to a portion of our patent portfolio, technology, and software, including our secure domain name registry service, to domain infrastructure providers, communication service providers as well as to system integrators. Our GABRIEL Connection Technology\u2122 License is offered to OEM customers who want to adopt the GABRIEL Connection Technology\u2122 as their solution for establishing secure connections using secure domain names within their products. We have developed GABRIEL Connection Technology\u2122 Software Development Kit (SDK) to assist with rapid integration of these techniques into existing software implementations. Customers who want to develop their own implementation of the VirnetX patented techniques for supporting secure domain names, or other techniques that are covered by our patent portfolio for establishing secure communication links, can purchase a patent license. The number of patents licensed, and therefore the cost of the patent license to the customer, will depend upon which of the patents are used in a particular product or service. These licenses will typically include an initial license fee, as well as an ongoing royalty.\nOur employees include the core development team behind our patent portfolio, technology, and software. Some members of this team have worked together for over twenty years and were on same team that invented and developed this technology while working at Leidos, Inc. (\u201cLeidos\u201d). The team has continued its research and development work and expanded the set of patents we acquired in 2006 from Leidos, into a larger patent portfolio. This portfolio now serves as the foundation of our products, services, and our licensing business. It is expected to generate most of our future revenue in license fees and royalties. We intend to continue our efforts to develop new products and technologies and further strengthen and expand our patent portfolio. We intend to continue using an outsourced and leveraged model to maintain efficiency and manage costs as we grow our licensing business by, for example, offering incentives to early licensing targets or asserting our rights for use of our patents.\nIndex\nIndustry Overview & Trends\nWe believe that the rapid growth in remote work has accelerated digital business transformation initiatives that would have taken years, into a matter of months. The demand to work remotely, explosive growth of video conferencing tools and rapid growth in the cloud has created an opportunity to secure communications regardless of a user\u2019s location, network, or BYOD (bring your own device).\nThe shift to remote work and expansion of the enterprise network perimeter has driven the growth of ZTNA solutions. The Zero Trust concept treats all networks like the Internet, where all users and devices are untrusted by default. Their location within the network is not a factor for deciding trust. Each user and device on the network require authentication and authorization, based on policy, prior to accessing any applications or resources on the network. ZTNA facilitates security around remote work, because Zero Trust policies enable granular access control, end-to-end encryption of network communications and remove application visibility from the public Internet reducing the attack surface. Based on our research and estimates, we believe that the Zero-Trust Security Market size is projected to grow from USD 15.6 billion in 2019 to USD 38.6 billion by 2024, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 19.9% from 2019 to 2024. We believe Zero Trust represents a growing market and an ideal fit for our technology and products.\nWith large portions of the global population now living under some form of lockdown, the global coronavirus pandemic has forced many organizations to shift their business processes - and their employees are having to embrace a work-from-home culture on a scale never attempted. Remote work has accelerated the adoption of video conferencing and meeting applications across all industries making it an essential tool to connect with remote customers, workforces, and employees to prevent direct contact. Based on our estimates, we believe that the worldwide Video Conferencing Market size is projected to grow from USD 14 billion in 2019 to USD 35 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 16.5% from 2020 to 2026. This rapid adoption, learning curve and demand to continue working remotely has created significant security concerns and breaches for enterprises. Our market research has focused on security conscious verticals such as healthcare, banking, legal and government where security breaches can significantly impact outcomes. In many cases, these enterprises adopted industry standard video conferencing tools and are now looking at more secure alternative solutions. Enterprises want video conferencing solutions that protect their information and allow them greater security control and visibility, while continuing to be reliable, easy to use and cost effective. Enterprises in these verticals are also looking for video conferencing solutions that integrate into their existing workflows and better align with specific use cases instead of forcing them to adapt to more one size fits all solutions on the market. We believe our GABRIEL Collaboration Suite\u2122 represents a starting point to offer secure video conferencing tools built on a zero-trust architecture.\nCloud computing growth has rapidly expanded as enterprises continue to move applications and services to the cloud. The cloud offers scalability, operations and development efficiency and remote access benefits for their workforce. Based on our estimates, we believe that the global cloud computing market size is expected to grow from approximately USD 293 billion in 2020 to over USD 810 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 18.5% during the forecast period. The cloud technology adoption is expected to increase quite significantly in industries where the Work-From-Home (WFH) initiative is helping to sustain enterprise business functions. However, shifting critical data to the cloud has resulted in security concerns and the need for enterprises to control access and gain visibility into how information is being used, who is accessing it and where it is going. We believe our scalable technology allows enterprises to secure applications and services regardless of whether hosting is on-premise or in the cloud.\nAs billions of connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices come online in support of enterprise operations, products, and industrial controls they will need to be secured and integrated into the enterprise. Facilitated by advancements in 4G/Advanced LTE and high-speed 5G networks, IoT devices will be able to operate from any network, transmit higher volumes of data including video streaming and sensor data collection and require real-time decisions based on that data. Without next generation security, these IoT devices represent a large attack surface that manages and control critical enterprise infrastructure. These IoT devices can operate from anywhere, will need to be secured with the same level of network security and ZTNA solutions enterprises are already deploying for their remote workforce. We believe that the market opportunity for our software and technology solutions is large and expanding as secure domain names are now an integral part of securing the next generation 5G and 4G/LTE Advanced wireless networks and IoT communications in areas including Smart City, Connected Car and Connected Home. Based on our estimates, we believe that the size of global Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) market is projected to grow from USD 83.6 billion in 2020 to approximately USD 254 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 20.35% during this forecasted period with a growing investment in securing the infrastructure around these devices.\nIndex\nOur Approach & Strategy\nOur portfolio of intellectual property is the foundation of our business model. We currently own approximately 194 total patents and pending applications, including 70 U.S. patents/patent applications and 124 foreign patents/validations/pending applications. This portfolio now serves as the foundation of our products, services, and our licensing business. It is expected to generate the majority of our future revenue in license fees and royalties.\nOur strategy is to become the market leader in securing real-time communications over the Internet and to establish our GABRIEL Connection Technology\u2122 as the industry standard security platform. Key elements of our strategy are to:\n\u2022 Actively recruit partners in various vertical markets, including healthcare, finance, legal, government to help us rapidly expand our enterprise customer base.\n\u2022 Continue to grow our technology licensing program to commercialize our intellectual property, including our GABRIEL Connection Technology\u2122.\n\u2022 Promote our Gabriel Secure Communication Platform\u2122 as a solution for delivering ZTNA.\n\u2022 Grow our GABRIEL Gateway product offering to secure enterprise applications, services, and infrastructure.\n\u2022 Grow registration of GABRIEL Secure Domains as the network segmentation component of our ZTNA solution. Establish VirnetX as the exclusive, universal registry of secure domain names and enable our customers to act as registrars for their users and broker secure communication between devices.\n\u2022 Promote Gabriel Collaboration Suite\u2122 products in the general market for sale to end-user enterprises, directly and with partners, with targeted promotions and other marketing programs. Expand GABRIEL Collaboration Suite\u2122 to include video conferencing to assist remote workers and offer an industry leading secure meeting solution.\nGABRIEL Secure Communication Platform\u2122 delivers ZTNA allowing enterprises to secure their information, control access and gain visibility into how information is being used, who is accessing it and where it is going. Our patented technology allows enterprises to license our technology for integration into their products and services, easily deploy our technology through our GABRIEL Gateway product for endpoint security or securing their communications with our GABRIEL Collaboration Suite\u2122 application.\nWe believe GABRIEL Gateway will support enterprises in securing their networks as their applications, services, virtualized resources, and data moves to the cloud. GABRIEL Gateway secures applications, services and infrastructure using ZTNA. Enterprises can quickly deploy GABRIEL Gateway to protect legacy applications, secure new cloud-based services and remove application visibility from the public Internet. Enterprises can move towards more granular network access control to protect their network at the edge and away from legacy VPN technologies. GABRIEL Gateway enables remote employees to securely communication with on-premise and cloud-based applications, regardless of their location. GABRIEL Gateway is included with the GABRIEL Collaboration Suite\u2122 and offered as a separate licensing program for enterprises that need a Gateway only solution. Enterprises can also use GABRIEL Gateway to secure open-source applications powering communications, data and analytics, infrastructure, and business services with a focus on making those applications easier to secure, access and manage.\nGABRIEL Secure Domains provide two fundamental capabilities for enterprises to manage device security and access control.\n\u2022 Unique, certificate-based device identities, tied to a user, that are used to authenticate and authorize device access (e.g., GABRIEL Connection Technology\u2122), based on a set of policies.\n\u2022 Flexible, software-based network segmentation that enterprises can deploy on-demand, without requiring additional hardware infrastructure.\nEnterprise customers understand the complexity of device certificate management at scale, the operational costs and security ramifications, if not done properly. GABRIEL Secure Domains enable certificate-based identities and when used within the GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform\u2122, provides a cloud-based service that automates the process of issuing, renewing, and revoking device certificates across the enterprise at scale. With GABRIEL Secure Domains, enterprises have a solution for managing device security and access control driven by the rapid growth of IoT and remote work.\nEach GABRIEL Secure Domain creates a network microsegment or secure enclave that includes a set of resources (e.g., applications, services, or data) and a set of users and devices an enterprise can assign to access those resources. Used within the GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform\u2122, enterprises can scale and adapt their network architecture, on-demand, based on business and workforce needs. Enterprises see the power of GABRIEL Secure Domains as a way to flexibility segment their networks, enforce access policies, audit compliance, isolate and limit lateral network movement, secure and limit access for remote workers and gain access control and visibility into their network.\nIndex\nWe believe GABRIEL Collaboration Suite\u2122 provides the foundation for real-time, secure communications and collaboration applications for the enterprise remote workforce. We bundle multiple applications together within the GABRIEL Collaboration Suite\u2122, including Secure Chat, Secure Share, Secure Video/Voice, Secure Mail, Secure Backup/Sync and GABRIEL Gateway. We are exploring unbundling the applications within GABRIEL Collaboration Suite\u2122 and offering \u00e0 la carte product options. This approach allows us to offer more flexible licensing options to solve specific customer use-cases, align with partner product offerings and create upsell opportunities.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe believe the following competitive strengths will enable our success in the marketplace:\n\u2022 Unique patented technology. We are focused on developing innovative technology for securing real-time communications over the Internet and establishing the exclusive secure domain name registry in the United States and other key markets around the world.

It may take years to determine whether and how existing laws governing intellectual property, privacy, data protection and libel apply to online communications and media. Such legislation may interfere with the growth in use of online secure communications and decrease the acceptance of online secure communications as a viable solution, which could adversely affect our business.\nDue to the Internet\u2019s popularity and increasing use, new laws regulating secure communications may be adopted. These laws and regulations may cover, among other things, issues relating to privacy, data protection, pricing, taxation, telecommunications over the Internet, content, copyrights, distribution and quality of products and services. We intend to comply with all new laws and regulations as they are adopted.\nThe U.S. government has controlled the authoritative domain name system, or DNS, root server since the inception of the Internet. On July 1, 1997, the President of the United States directed the U.S. Secretary of Commerce to privatize the management of the domain name system in a manner that increases competition and facilitates international participation in its management.\nIndex\nOn September 29, 2006, the U.S. Department of Commerce extended its delegation of authority by entering into a new agreement with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, a California non-profit corporation headquartered in Marina Del Rey, California. ICANN is responsible for managing the accreditation of registry providers and registrars that manage the assignment of top-level domain names associated with the authoritative DNS root directory. Although it is possible to create and manage other DNS root directories privately without accreditation from ICANN, the possibility of conflicting name and number assignments makes it less likely that users would widely adopt a top-level domain name associated with an alternative DNS root directory provided by a non-ICANN-accredited registry service.\nEmployees\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company had 21 full and part time employees, most of whom work remotely from our corporate offices. The Company has had an at-home work force since its inception. The emphasis of our employees is on our technology research and product development with 11 employees focused on this effort. The team has been working on enhancing our products and adding new functionality along with successfully filing several new patent applications in 2021. We also continue building our sales and marketing teams to expand our product-lines and customer base. In 2021 we added a Chief Operating Officer for our subsidiary in Japan who will be focused on growing our market and products in that region.\nIn addition to our regular employees, we also engage with important consultants on a regular basis. These consultants can be involved in our product development, customer relations, legal, and/or regulatory compliance and reporting. The Company has experienced low employee turnover rates over the years with both employees and some consultants participating in our incentive stock option/RSU plans.\nAvailable Information\nWe file or furnish various reports, such as registration statements, periodic and current reports, proxy statements and other materials with the SEC.

    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe Company\nWe are an Internet security software and technology company with patented technology for various types of secure network communications, including 5G and 4G LTE network security. Our patented Secure Domain Name Registry and GABRIEL Connection Technology\u2122, are the foundation for our GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform\u2122 that protects communications using Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA). Our technology generates secure connections on a \u201czero-click\u201d or \u201csingle-click\u201d basis, significantly simplifying the deployment of secure real-time communication solutions by eliminating the need for end-users to enter any encryption information. Our portfolio of intellectual property is the foundation of our business model. We currently own approximately 194 total patents and pending applications, including 70 U.S. patents/patent applications and 124 foreign patents/validations/pending applications. Our patent portfolio is primarily focused on securing real-time communications over the Internet, and related services, and is used in all our technology and products, some of which were acquired by our principal operating subsidiary; VirnetX, Inc., from Leidos, Inc., or Leidos, (f/k/a Science Applications International Corporation, or SAIC) in 2006.\nOur product portfolio includes sophisticated technologies, products and services that are available for sale worldwide. Our GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform\u2122 includes a set of software libraries with application interfaces available for securing third-party applications seamlessly across multiple operating systems. It enables individuals and organizations to maintain complete ownership and control over their personal and confidential data, secured within their own private network, while enabling authorized secure encrypted access from anywhere at any time.\nIndex\nOur GABRIEL Gateway product extends our Secure Communication Platform\u2122 by allowing existing networked devices and services to seamlessly join the \u201cGABRIEL SECURED\u201d network without requiring any modifications. All these devices or services, including on-premise or cloud-based services, can now be assigned a VirnetX Secure Domain Name and use fully authenticated, secure communication channels for its communications.\nOur GABRIEL Collaboration Suite\u2122 is a set of communication applications and tools that use our GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform\u2122. It enables seamless and secure cross-platform communications between devices that are enrolled in our \u201cGABRIEL SECURED\u201d network and have our software installed. Our GABRIEL Collaboration Suite\u2122 is available for download and free trial, for Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X platforms, at https://virnetx.com.\nWe continue to enhance our products and add new functionality. We will provide updates to new and existing customers as they are released to the public. Many small and medium businesses have installed our GABRIEL Secure Communication Platform\u2122 and GABRIEL Collaboration Suite\u2122 products in their corporate networks. We intend to continue to expand our customer base with targeted promotions and direct sales initiatives.\nWe have an ongoing GABRIEL Licensing Program under which we offer licenses to a portion of our patent portfolio, technology, and software, including our secure domain name registry service, to domain infrastructure providers, communication service providers as well as to system integrators. Our GABRIEL Connection Technology\u2122 License is offered to OEM customers who want to adopt the GABRIEL Connection Technology\u2122 as their solution for establishing secure connections using secure domain names within their products. We have developed GABRIEL Connection Technology\u2122 Software Development Kit (SDK) to assist with rapid integration of these techniques into existing software implementations. Customers who want to develop their own implementation of the VirnetX patented techniques for supporting secure domain names, or other techniques that are covered by our patent portfolio for establishing secure communication links, can purchase a patent license. The number of patents licensed, and therefore the cost of the patent license to the customer, will depend upon which of the patents are used in a particular product or service. These licenses will typically include an initial license fee, as well as an ongoing royalty.\nOur employees include the core development team behind our patent portfolio, technology, and software. Some members of this team have worked together for over twenty years and were on same team that invented and developed this technology while working at Leidos, Inc. (\u201cLeidos\u201d). The team has continued its research and development work and expanded the set of patents we acquired in 2006 from Leidos, into a larger patent portfolio. This portfolio now serves as the foundation of our products, services, and our licensing business. It is expected to generate most of our future revenue in license fees and royalties. We intend to continue our efforts to develop new products and technologies and further strengthen and expand our patent portfolio. We intend to continue using an outsourced and leveraged model to maintain efficiency and manage costs as we grow our licensing business by, for example, offering incentives to early licensing targets or asserting our rights for use of our patents.\nIndex\nLitigation (all dollar amounts in this section are expressed in thousands except for rates per device)\nWe have several intellectual property infringement lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division (\u201cUSDC\u201d), and United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\u201cUSCAFC\u201d) and the Supreme Court of the United States (\u201cSCOTUS\u201d).\nVirnetX Inc. v. Cisco Systems, Inc. et al. (Case 6:10-CV-00417-LED) (\u201cApple I\u201d)\nOn August 11, 2010, we filed a complaint against Aastra USA. Inc. (\u201cAastra\u201d), Apple Inc. (\u201cApple\u201d), Cisco Systems, Inc. (\u201cCisco\u201d), and NEC Corporation (\u201cNEC\u201d) the USDC in which we alleged that these parties infringe on certain of our patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,502,135, 7,418,504, 7,921,211 and 7,490,151). We sought damages and injunctive relief. The cases against each defendant were separated by the judge. Aastra and NEC agreed to sign license agreements with us, and we dropped all accusations of infringement against them. A jury in USDC decided that our patents were not invalid and rendered a verdict of non-infringement by Cisco on March 4, 2013. Our motion for a new Cisco trial was denied and the case against Cisco was closed.\nOn November 6, 2012, a jury in the USDC awarded us over $368,000 for Apple\u2019s infringement of four of our patents, plus daily interest up to the final judgment.\nApple filed an appeal of the judgment to the USCAFC. On September 16, 2014, USCAFC affirmed the USDC jury\u2019s finding that all four of our patents at issue are valid and confirmed the USDC jury\u2019s finding of infringement of VPN on Demand under many of the asserted claims of our \u2018135 and \u2018151 patents, and the USDC\u2019s decision to allow evidence about our license and royalty rates regarding the determination of damages. However, the USCAFC vacated the USDC jury\u2019s damages award and some of the USDC\u2019s claim construction with respect to parts of our \u2018504 and \u2018211 patents and remanded the damages award and determination of infringement with respect to FaceTime back to the USDC for further proceedings.\nOn September 30, 2016, pursuant to the 2014 remand from the USCAFC, a jury in the USDC awarded us $302,400 for Apple\u2019s infringement of four of our patents. On September 29, 2017, the USDC entered its final judgment, denied all of Apple\u2019s post-trial motions, granted all our post-trial motions, including our motion for willful infringement and enhanced the royalty rate during the willfulness period from $1.20 to $1.80 per device, and awarded us costs, certain attorneys\u2019 fees, and prejudgment interest. The total amount in the final judgment was $439,700, including $302,400 (jury verdict), $41,300 (enhanced damages) and $96,000 (costs, fees, and interest).\nOn October 27, 2017 Apple appealed the final judgment entered on September 29, 2017 to the USCAFC. Oral arguments in this case were held on January 8, 2019. On January 15, 2019, the Court issued a Rule 36 order affirming the district court\u2019s final judgment. Apple filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en-banc in this matter on February 21, 2019. On October 1, 2019, USCAFC issued an order denying Apple\u2019s petition. Apple filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the SCOTUS, which was denied on February 24, 2020. Prior to the SCOTUS decision denying Apple\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, on February 20, 2020, Apple filed a Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment with the USDC, seeking relief from the district court\u2019s September 29, 2017 final judgment. VirnetX filed a responsive brief in opposition on March 5, 2020.\nIndex\nOn March 13, 2020, the Company received payment of $454,034 from Apple, representing the previously announced final judgment with interest in this case. Apple sought payment relief by filing a motion under Rule 60(b). On September 1, 2020 USDC issued an order denying Apple\u2019s motion for relief of judgement. This case is now closed.\nVirnetX Inc. v. Apple, Inc. (Case 6:12-CV-00855-LED) (\u201cApple II\u201d)\nThis case began on November 6, 2012, when we had filed a complaint against Apple in USDC in which we alleged that Apple infringed on certain of our patents, (U.S. Patent Nos. 6,502,135, 7,418,504, 7,921,211 and 7,490,151). We sought damages and injunctive relief. The accused products include the iPhone 5, iPod Touch 5th Generation, iPad 4th Generation, iPad mini, and the latest Macintosh computers; these products were not included in the Apple I case because they were released after the Apple I case was initiated. Post-trial motions hearing was held on July 18, 2018. On August 31, 2018, the USDC entered a Final Judgment and issued its Memorandum Opinion and Order regarding post-trial motions, affirming the jury\u2019s verdict of $502,600 and granting VirnetX motions for supplemental damages, a sunset royalty, and the royalty rate of $1.20 per infringing iPhone, iPad and Mac products, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest and costs. Apple filed a notice of appeal with the USCAFC in the Apple II case.\nOn October 9, 2018, USCAFC docketed the appeal as Case No. 19-1050 - VirnetX Inc. v. Apple Inc . On January 24, 2019 Apple filed its opening brief. We filed our response brief on March 1, 2019. Apple filed its reply brief on April 5, 2019. The oral arguments were heard on October 4, 2019. On November 22, 2019, the USCAFC issued an opinion affirming the district court\u2019s findings that Apple is precluded from making certain invalidity arguments and that Apple infringed the \u2019135 and \u2019151 patents; reversing the USDC\u2019s finding that Apple infringed the \u2019504 and \u2019211 patents; and remanding the case for proceedings on damages. Apple sought panel and en banc rehearing, which the USCAFC denied on February 10, 2020.\nOn February 22, 2020, the USDC issued a scheduling order for the parties to brief the court about the need for a new trial for recalculating the damages. We filed our motion for entry of judgment on February 28, 2020. The arguments on this matter were heard on April 14, 2020. In its order, unsealed on May 1, 2020, the USDC denied VirnetX\u2019s motion for entry of a new judgment based on the prior jury verdict and ordered a new jury trial on damages. On August 10, 2020, the USDC granted Apple\u2019s motion for continuance and reset the date to October 26, 2020. On October 30, 2020, a jury returned a $502,800 verdict in favor of VirnetX based on Apple\u2019s infringement of two network security patents: VirnetX US Patents No. 6,502,135 and No. 7,490,151. The jury verdict called for damages of $0.84 per accused device since the 2013 launch of Apple\u2019s iOS 7 operating system and represents 598,629,580 infringing units from US sales only. On January 15, 2021, the district court denied Apple\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, and on February 4, 2021, Apple filed a notice of appeal to the USCAFC.\nVirnetX Inc. v. Mangrove Partners Master Fund, Ltd., Apple Inc. (USCAFC Case 20-2271) and VirnetX Inc. v. Mangrove Partners Master Fund, Ltd., Apple Inc., and Black Swamp, LLC (USAFC Case 20-2272)\nOn September 15, 2020, we filed with the USCAFC an appeal of the invalidity findings by the PTAB in inter-partes review proceedings IPR2015-01046 and IPR2016-00062 involving our U.S. Patent No. 6,502,135, and an appeal of the invalidity findings by the PTAB in inter partes review proceedings IPR2015-1047, IPR2016- 00063, and IPR2016-00167 involving our U.S. Patent No. 7,490,151. On September 25, 2020, the USCAFC issued an order consolidating the two appeals. On December 15, 2020, we filed a motion to vacate the PTAB decisions below and to remand these appeals to the PTAB, which remains pending. In view of our motion to remand, our deadline to file an initial brief is currently stayed.\nIancu v. Luoma (SCOTUS Case 20-74)\nOn July 23, 2020, the United States and the USPTO (collectively, \u201cthe United States\u201d) filed a petition for a writ of certiorari from several decisions by the USAFC, including decisions in VirnetX Inc. v. Cisco Systems, Inc., Nos. 2019-1671, and VirnetX Inc. v. Iancu, Nos. 2017-2593, -2594. In those cases, the USAFC granted VirnetX\u2019s motions to vacate the underlying decisions of the PTAB on the basis of Arthrex, Inc. v. Smith & Nephew, Inc., 941 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2019), and remanded for further proceedings. The United States requested that the SCOTUS hold its certiorari petition pending the disposition of the United States\u2019 separate petition in United States v. Arthrex, Inc., No. 19-1434 (filed June 25, 2020). On August 26, 2020, VirnetX filed a response, agreeing that the United States\u2019 certiorari petition should be held pending the disposition of the petition for a writ of certiorari in No. 19-1434 (and related petitions filed by private parties in Nos. 19-1452 and 19-1458), and any further SCOTUS proceedings.\nIndex\nOn October 13, 2020, SCOTUS granted the United States\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari in No. 19-1434 as to USAFC Case No. 2018-2140, and the petitions for writs of certiorari in Nos. 19-1452 and 19-1458, all limited to Questions 1 and 2 as set forth in the July 22, 2020 Memorandum for the United States filed in No. 19-1434. The consolidated petition is seeking review of decisions by the USCAFC holding that administrative patent judges (\u201cAPJ\u201d) of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office must be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate; and, whether the remedy imposed by USCAFC that federal laws that place restrictions on when officials can be removed from office cannot apply to APJ, was the appropriate one. SCOTUS heard oral argument in these consolidated cases on March 1, 2021.\nMcKool Smith P.C. v. VirnetX, Inc., AAA Case No. 01-20-0003-7975\nOn March 23, 2020, the law firm of McKool Smith, P.C. (\u201cMcKool\u201d) filed a Demand for Arbitration against VirnetX, Inc. with the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d). In its demand, McKool claims that a retention agreement it entered into in 2010 with VirnetX entitles it to a contingency fee arising from the recent 2020 payment made by Apple. McKool claims it is owed approximately $36,300 (or 8% of the Apple I payment). We have filed a general response with the AAA denying McKool\u2019s claim and are contesting the matter vigorously. An evidentiary hearing was held on the matter during the week of February 22, 2021 and the parties will be submitting additional briefing. A ruling is expected sometime thereafter.\nNeal Hurwitz v. Kendall Larsen et al. (Case 2020-0425-JRS)\nOn June 2, 2020, stockholder Neal Hurwitz filed a verified derivative complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Kendall Larsen, Robert D. Short Ill, Gary Feiner, Michael F. Angelo, and Thomas M. O\u2019Brien and naming the Company as nominal defendant. The lawsuit alleges breaches of fiduciary duty, corporate waste, and unjust enrichment arising out of a series of previously-disclosed transactions and compensation awards and seeks an award of monetary damages and equitable relief. On July 1, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint based on a failure to plead demand futility and a failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted and, on August 19, 2020, the defendants filed an opening brief in support of their motion to dismiss. On October 16, 2020, plaintiff amended his complaint rather than respond to the arguments in the defendants\u2019 opening brief. On October 23, 2020, the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint based on a failure to plead demand futility and a failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted. On January 12, 2021, Hurwitz voluntarily dismissed his suit without prejudice.\nOther Legal Matters\nOne or more potential intellectual property infringement claims may also be available to us against certain other companies who have the resources to defend against any such claims. Although we believe these potential claims are likely valid, commencing a lawsuit can be expensive and time-consuming, and there is no assurance that we could prevail on such potential claims if we made them. In addition, bringing a lawsuit may lead to potential counterclaims which may distract our management and our other resources, including capital resources, from efforts to successfully commercialize our products.\nCurrently, we are not a party to any other pending legal proceedings and are not aware of any proceeding threatened or contemplated against us.\nCommitments and Related Party Transactions\nWe lease our offices under an operating lease with a third party expiring in October 2021. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nWe entered into a service agreement for the use of an aircraft from K2 Investment Fund LLC (\u201cLLC\u201d) for business travel for employees of the Company. We incurred approximately $324, and $1,790 in rental fees and reimbursements to the LLC during the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We pay for the Company\u2019s business usage of the aircraft and have no right to purchase. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Administrative Officer are the managing partners of the LLC and control the equity interests of the LLC. We entered into a 12-month non-exclusive agreement with the LLC for use of the plane at a rate of $8 per flight hour, with no minimum usage requirement. The agreement contains other terms and conditions normal in such transactions and can be cancelled by either us or the LLC with 30 days\u2019 notice. The agreement renews on an annual basis unless terminated by either party. Neither party has exercised their termination rights.\nIndex\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. The critical accounting policies we employ in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are those which involve impairment of long-lived assets, income taxes, fair value of financial instruments and stock-based compensation.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VirnetX Holding Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In doing so, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in our accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, at the time they are made, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement, giving the Company a right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) asset, is a lease at inception. Operating lease ROU assets are included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. ROU assets represent the Company\u2019s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company\u2019s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the arrangement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Other assets at December 31, 2020, include a ROU asset related to a facility lease for corporate promotional and marketing purposes. The facility lease was paid in full at inception and the ROU is being amortized over the term of the lease. Other assets also include an ROU related to our office operating lease which expires in October 2021 (See Note 13 - Leases).\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives revenue from licensing and royalty fees from contracts with customers which often span several years. We account for this revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract\u2019s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Our revenue arrangements may consist of multiple-element arrangements, with revenue for each unit of accounting recognized as the product or service is delivered to the customer.\nWith the licensing of our patents, performance obligations are generally satisfied at a point in time as work is complete when our patent rights are transferred to our customers. We generally have no further obligation to our customers regarding our technology.\nCertain contracts may require our customers to enter into a hosting arrangement with us and for these arrangements, revenue is recognized over time, generally over the life of the servicing contract.\nThe Company actively monitors and enforces its intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) rights, including seeking appropriate compensation from third parties that utilize the Company\u2019s IP without a license. As a result, the Company may, from time to time, receive payments as part of a settlement or compensation for a patent infringement dispute. Proceeds received are allocated to each element identified in the settlement or compensation, based on the fair value of each element. Generally, settlements and compensation may include the following elements: the value of a license or royalty agreement, cost reimbursement, damages, and interest. Elements identified related to licensing and royalty are recognized as revenue. Elements identified as reimbursed costs are generally recorded as a reduction to the reported expenses. Elements identified as damages or interest are generally recorded in other income in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.\nIndex\nLicensing Costs\nLicensing costs are incurred pursuant to favorable court decisions relating to patent infringement cases and are included in operating expenses in the Company\u2019s consolidated statement of operations.\nContingent Gains\nASC Topic 450-30-25, Contingent Gains, prohibits recognition of contingent gains until realized. Accordingly, we do not record contingent gains ahead of such realization. Management generally considers any such gains as realized only upon the collection of cash.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued.\nConcentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties\nOur cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained at two major financial institutions in the United States. A portion of those balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had funds which were uninsured. We do not believe that we are subject to any unusual financial risk beyond the normal risk associated with commercial banking relationships with major financial institutions. We have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe identify and record impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable, but not less than annually. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the anticipated future net undiscounted cash flows to the related assets\u2019 carrying value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the asset.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method require the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities. We calculate current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from actual results reflected on the income tax returns filed during the following years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified in the subsequent years. The effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the tax rate change is enacted. In assessing our deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nA valuation allowance is provided for deferred income tax assets when, in our judgment, based upon currently available information and other factors, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the need for a valuation allowance is based on an on-going evaluation of current information including, among other things, historical operating results, estimates of future earnings in different taxing jurisdictions and the expected timing of the reversals of temporary differences. We believe the determination to record a valuation allowance to reduce a deferred income tax asset is a significant accounting estimate because it is based, among other things, on an estimate of future taxable income in the United States and certain other jurisdictions, which is susceptible to change and may or may not occur, and because the impact of adjusting a valuation allowance may be material. In determining when to release the valuation allowance established against our net deferred income tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative. Due to the 2020 income, we have released the valuation allowance against federal net deferred tax assets, and we maintain a partial valuation allowance against the state net operating loss and credit carryovers due to lack of income in California. We continually assess our ability to generate sufficient taxable income during future periods in which our deferred tax assets may be realized. If and when we believe it is more likely than not that we will recover our deferred tax assets, we will reverse the valuation allowance as an income tax benefit in our statements of operations.\nIndex\nWe account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The U.S. GAAP method of accounting for uncertain tax positions utilizes a two-step approach to evaluate tax positions. Step one, recognition, requires evaluation of the tax position to determine if based solely on technical merits it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. Step two, measurement, is addressed only if a position is more likely than not to be sustained. In step two, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative probability basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with tax authorities. If a position does not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition in step one, no benefit is recorded until the first subsequent period in which the more likely than not standard is met, the issue is resolved with the taxing authority, or the statute of limitations expires. Positions previously recognized are derecognized when we subsequently determine the position no longer is more likely than not to be sustained. Evaluation of tax positions, their technical merits, and measurements using cumulative probability are highly subjective management estimates. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation using the fair value recognition method. We recognize these compensation costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally based on the option vesting term of 4 years.\nIn addition, we record stock-based compensation expense for awards granted to non-employees at fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity investments issued generally as they vest over the performance period.\nFair Value\nWe apply fair value accounting to all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\u2019s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nOur financial instruments are stated at amounts that equal, or are intended to approximate, fair value. When we approximate fair value, we utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument, including assumptions about risk and inputs to the valuation technique. We use quoted valuation techniques, primarily the income and market approach that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs for recurring fair value measurements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2019-12 Income Taxes (Topic 740). The amendments in this ASU simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify U.S. GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIndex\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance within ASU 2019-04 and ASU 2019-05 (collectively, \u201cASU 2016-13\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2016-13 replace the incurred loss impairment methodology with the current expected credit loss model, which requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to estimate credit losses. The Company adopted this ASU effective January 1, 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nResults of Operations (all amounts in this section are expressed in thousands)\nRevenue\nRevenue\n$\n302,636\n$\nRevenue generated for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $302,636 compared to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $85. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company collected a lump sum payment of $454,034 from Apple, Inc. (see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d), as a result of a favorable court decision relating to a patent infringement case. The one-time payment includes past royalties, damages for willful infringement, interest, court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees. (See \u201cRevenue Recognition\u201d in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nWe recognized royalty revenue as part of license agreements entered into with customers during the patent infringement actions (see \u201cLitigation\u201d). These revenues relate to payment for use of our patented technology prior to the signing of a license agreement, and royalty payments after the execution of the license agreements.\nLicensing Costs\nIncluded in operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, were $90,101 in licensing costs we incurred in conjunction with the proceeds received from Apple Inc., pursuant to a favorable court decision relating to a patent infringement case.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and Development\n$\n8,830\n$\n3,845\nResearch and development costs include expenses paid to outside development consultants and compensation-related expenses for our engineering staff. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nOur research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $8,830 compared to December 31, 2019 of $3,845. The increase in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to increased compensation expense.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative\n$\n45,812\n$\n15,905\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include compensation expense for management and administrative personnel, as well as expenses for outside legal, accounting, and consulting services.\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $45,812 compared to December 31, 2019 of $15,905. The volatility within selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to legal fees related to cases involving the defense of our patents. Legal fees were $30,699 and $5,898 in 2020 and 2019, respectively and represent approximately 67% of selling, general and administrative expenses for 2020 compared to 37% for 2019.\nGain on Settlement\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain of $41,271 pursuant to a favorable court ruling in the case regarding Apple, Inc. discussed above. (See \u201cRevenue Recognition\u201d in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nInterest and Other Income, net\nInterest and Other Income\n$\n108,288\n$\nIndex\nInterest and other income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $108,288 compared to December 31, 2019 of $92. During 2020 we received interest of $108,221 pursuant to a favorable court ruling in the case with Apple, Inc. discussed above. (See \u201cRevenue Recognition\u201d in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nEffective Income Tax Rate\nA reconciliation of the United States federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2020\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2019\nUnited States federal statutory rate\n21.00\n%\n21.00\n%\nState taxes, net of federal benefit\n0.17\n%\n1.99\n%\nValuation allowance\n(12.22\n) %\n(21.96\n) %\nStock based compensation\n(0.01\n) %\n-\nR&D Credit\n(0.21\n) %\n1.34\n%\nOther\n0.06\n%\n(0.38\n) %\nEffective income tax rate\n8.79\n%\n1.99\n%\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for both 2020 and 2019 was lower than the statutory Federal income tax rate primarily due to the change in valuation allowance. In 2020 we had pre-tax income of $307,452 and in 2019 we had pre-tax losses of $19,573. At December 31, 2020, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of $107,989. All of the Federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards have been utilized to offset the taxable income in 2020. The state NOL carryforwards begin expiring in 2029.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $192,908 and our short-term investments totaled $28,348 compared to $3,135 and $2,394, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWe expect that our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2020, will be sufficient to fund our current level of selling, general and administration costs, including legal expenses and provide related working capital for the foreseeable future. Over the longer term, we expect to derive the majority of our future revenue from license fees and royalties associated with our patent portfolio, technology, software and secure domain name registry in the United States and other markets around the world.\nUniversal Shelf Registration and ATM Offering\nOn July 30, 2018 we filed a $100,000 universal shelf registration statement on SEC Form S-3 which was declared effective by the SEC on August 16, 2018. We also entered an at-the-market equity offering sales agreement (\u201cATM\u201d) with Cowen & Company, LLC on August 31, 2018, under which we can offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of up to $50,000.\nWe use the ATM proceeds for GABRIEL product development, marketing, and general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures, other corporate expenses and acquisitions of complementary products, technologies, or businesses. As of December 31, 2020, common stock with an aggregate value of up to $21,964 remained available for offer and sale under the ATM agreement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 1,049,382 shares under the ATM. The average sales price per common share was $4.41 and the aggregate proceeds from the sales totaled $4,627 during the period. Sales commissions, fees and other costs associated with the ATM totaled $139.",

    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nPareteum Corporation (OTC: TEUM) is a rapidly growing cloud software communications platform company with a mission - to Connect Every Person and Every(Thing) \u2122.\nMillions of people and devices are connected around the world using Pareteum\u2019s global cloud software communications platform, enhancing their mobile experience. Pareteum\u2019s goal is to unleash the power of applications and mobile services, which we believe will bring secure, ubiquitous, scalable, and seamlessly available voice, video, SMS/text messaging, and data services to our customers, making worldwide communications services easily and economically accessible to everyone. By harnessing the value of our cloud communications platform, Pareteum serves enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, Internet-of-Things (\u201cIoT\u201d), and telecommunications infrastructure providers.\nWith estimates of up to 30 billion devices to be managed and connected according to ABI Research, a market research firm that specializes in global connectivity and emerging technology, the total available market is vast. Service providers, brand marketing companies, and enterprise and IoT providers use Pareteum\u2019s cloud communication services and turnkey solutions featuring relevant content, applications, and connectivity worldwide. Pareteum integrates a variety of disparate communications methods and services and offers them to customers and application developers, allowing communications to become a value-added service. We believe that this is a major strategic goal for many industries, from legacy telecommunications providers to the disruptive technology and data enterprises of today and the future.\nThe vast majority of our platform is comprised of our internally-developed software and intellectual property, which provides our customers with flexibility in how they use our products and allows us to be market driven going forward. We have been granted more than 70 patents related to techniques and processes that support our cloud software and communications platform solutions. Our platform services partners (whose technologies are integrated into our cloud) include: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, AT&T, Amazon Web Services, Sonus, Veniam, Oracle, Microsoft, NetNumber, Affirmed Networks and other world-class technology providers.\nPareteum is a mission-focused company that seeks to empower \u201cEvery Person and Every(Thing)\u201d to be globally connected, hence our slogan - ANY DEVICE, ANY NETWORK, ANYWHERE\u2122. The Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, Enablers and Aggretators (\u201cMVNO\u201d, \u201cMVNE\u201d and \u201cMVNA\u201d), Smart Cities, and Application developer markets - each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity. These sectors need Communications-Platform-as-a-Service (\u201cCPaaS\u201d), which Pareteum delivers.\nCoronavirus Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) began spreading across the globe and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization; the President of the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) declared this a national emergency. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting social changes are not predictable. There are a number of uncertainties arising from COVID-19 that have impacted and could continue to impact our operating results: the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation measures, the duration of the pandemic, the pace and effectiveness of vaccination efforts, and the effect on global economic conditions. Likewise, business operational changes, work from home, school from home and shop from home all impact consumer confidence and the availability of supply chains to support these activities. We expect operating and financial results to continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 for the duration of the pandemic.\nWe have seen an increase in usage consumption, particularly for messaging and consumer mobile services during the pandemic. However, our products and services for customers in the travel and hospitality industries have been and continue to be negatively impacted. We expect volatility in customer demand and consumption habits as the pandemic continues, and we may experience constrained supply or curtailed customer demand that could adversely impact our operations. Specifically, we have seen slowing sales cycles, including customers and prospective customers delaying contracts or renewals. Customers in the pipeline are uncertain and may minimize commitments related to the products and services we offer.\nInnovative Use Cases\nMany sectors, from traditional network operators to disruptive technology and data-driven companies, have found many innovative use cases for our platforms. Beyond simply enabling communications between people and devices, the Company\u2019s platforms are designed to enable any of the following, among others:\n\u2022 Smart homes, including smart appliances, smart energy meters, wearables etc.\n\u2022 Connected cars\n\u2022 Smart cities\n\u2022 Smart logistics and supply chains\n\u2022 Smart healthcare applications\nIn addition to the foregoing, as a result of acquisitions completed in October 2018 and February 2019, the Company has acquired certain intellectual property portfolios (the \u201cAcquired IP Rights\u201d), which it now manages through various wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Company utilizes patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere to protect the Acquired IP Rights.\nBusiness Model\nAt Pareteum, our mission is to \u201cEmpower Consumer Service Providers (\u201cCSPs\u201d), Enterprises and Developers to simply create and control their own wireless communications products and experience through our powerful combination of software, services and global connectivity.\u201d We believe that open software and interfaces for communications services will create more innovation, economic freedom, and opportunity equality worldwide, just like the internet did for information. Our value proposition intersects with numerous applications and industries. It is our strong belief that no other company in the CPaaS market offers similarly broad value in such a comprehensive way.\nHowever, an easily accessible open mobility system for the world is challenging to scale because it requires a \u201cnetwork effect.\u201d The network effect is the principle that a service yields increased value as it grows. The essence of this point is that our business and our services will grow in value as we grow and scale. We aim to achieve that growth by providing the marketplace exchange on which these communications and transactions take place, and in doing so we attract new users and more customers.\nTo achieve our desired growth, we use our managed services solutions as a launching pad from which to grow our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform by offering Mobility, Engagement, Intelligence and Control products and services to our existing and prospective customers. This process is already well underway, including with our anchor customer Vodafone.\nGo-to-Market and Growth Strategy\nPareteum is in growth mode, which we expect to achieve through a combination of organic growth as well as targeted mergers and acquisitions, such as the recent Artilium, iPass and Devicescape acquisitions.\nPareteum seeks to continue winning new long-term contractual business. We expect this pace to increase throughout 2021 and beyond. Our focus is on selling and implementing new communications services and IoT opportunities as fast as reasonably possible, as the world of connected devices and people continues to rise on a daily basis.\nOur go-to-market strategy uses a four-phase approach:\nPhase 1: Continue to attract new subscribers across all verticals to all our platforms through direct sales, existing channel partnerships and new initiatives such as referral programs.\nPhase 2: Continue to on-board new communications services providers, multiplying our own growth, largely through business development and direct sales in each of our six defined sales regions (North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific).\nPhase 3: Drive adoption through a twin approach. First, we will be on-boarding more \u201cthings\u201d (whether Subscriber Identification Module (\u201cSIM\u201d) cards, handsets, devices, vehicles etc.) to our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform, as our initial user base. Second, we will be drawing in new and existing customers and end-users to add and consume more services into our existing Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. These will be people with the greatest pain point, who are underserved by the current mobility networks and applications out in the market (including in developing markets).\nPhase 4: At this stage, our strategic Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform customers will have their own go-to-market strategy, creating shared value, ranging from traditional consumer strategies to sophisticated B2B and B2B2C strategies, driving and expanding our ecosystem to new heights.\nThe phases described above are already being implemented, in parallel as far as possible, for the fastest, most sustainable growth, highlighting our strategy for accelerating the world\u2019s shift to an open mobility and application network. When we\u2019re successful, we believe it may accelerate the pace of innovation in the world, create more economic freedom, and provide better mobility services to billions of underserved people.\nWe also follow an organic growth plan focused on three core areas:\n\u2022 Exploring cross and up-sale opportunities among Pareteum\u2019s recent customer acquisitions - focused on offering new products and services that complement or supplement their existing or future needs so to accelerate their strategy;\n\u2022 Platform evolution - enhance and expand existing products and services; and\n\u2022 Geographic expansion-focusing on entering new markets such as South East Asia and Latin America.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had 218 full and part-time employees worldwide.\nResearch & Development\nPareteum\u2019s research and development function attempts to ensure that its communications platforms grow in line with customer needs and technological advancement, and remain resilient, reliable and secure. Product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $12.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively.\nIntellectual Property\nPareteum relies on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. The Company protects its brand and reputation through the exploitation of a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. Pareteum has two granted patents for inventions embedded in its communications platforms, and with the addition of Artilium and iPass has a patent portfolio of over 70 granted patents. The current patent portfolio includes, but is not limited to, a set of developments embracing areas such as advanced network characterization and migration, automated configuration for network appliances, method and system for changing security information in a computer network, method and system for verifying and updating the configuration of an access device during authentication, service quality monitoring process, system and method for enabling wireless social networking and systems and methods for network curation, all expiring throughout 2034, and subject to renewals.\nPareteum further protects its intellectual property rights by requiring all its employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property to assign those rights to the Company, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.\nSales & Marketing\nPareteum\u2019s sales and marketing teams work together to identify and establish relationships with prospective customers, acquire new ones and expand relationships with existing customers by encouraging their consumption of additional services and products existing in our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. Our marketing team generates leads through our website, online marketing campaigns, webinars, white papers, public relations and other outbound lead development efforts.\nWe engage with prospective and existing customers through an enterprise sales approach. Our sales executives directly engage C-Level executives and other senior business, product and technical decision makers responsible for the end-user experience and financial results at their companies. Our sales executives work to educate these decision makers and their teams about the benefits of using Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform to launch and scale robust communications experiences.\nCustomers\nOur customers are tier 1 communications service providers that provide telecommunications services to end-users, Fortune 1,000 companies, mobile virtual network enablers of all sizes, software developers, banks, financial and online payment services companies, global consulting companies, mobile marketing platforms, telecommunications applications, and many others.\nA customer advocate is assigned to each new contract, and a multi-step process of handoff from sales to service is handled by this distinct team that is made up of experienced staff around the globe and supported by back office professionals throughout the U.S., United Kingdom, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.\nPareteum provides multiple levels of customer support, including 24x7 support, to ensure service levels and network reliability to meet the expectations and requirements of Pareteum\u2019s customers. We believe that customers that use the Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform value our network reliability and availability, responsive customer support, competitive pricing, and collaborative approach.\nThe Company has a significant customer and the loss of this customer could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, this significant customer accounted for approximately 20% and 64% of our revenues.\nCompetition\nWe compete with telecommunications solution providers, cloud software and service providers, communications\u2019 platforms, and the in-house IT and network departments of communications companies as well as firms that provide IT services (including consulting, systems integration and managed services), software vendors that sell products for particular aspects of a total information system, software vendors that specialize in systems for particular communications services (such as Internet, land-line and mobile services, cable, satellite and service bureaus) and companies that offer software systems in combination with the sale of network equipment.\nWe believe that our ability to compete depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022 the development of software products by others that are competitive with our products and services;\n\u2022 the price at which others offer competitive software and services;\n\u2022 the ability to make use of the networks of mobile network operators;\n\u2022 the technological changes of telecommunication operators affecting our ability to run services over their networks;\n\u2022 the ability of competitors to deliver projects at a level of quality that rivals our own;\n\u2022 the responsiveness of our competitors to customer needs; and\n\u2022 the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate key personnel.\nA number of our competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, substantial financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and strong name recognition. Current and potential competitors have established, and may establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties.\nThe CPaaS market is moving quickly. We believe that the key competitive differentiators for Pareteum in the near-term will be:\n\u2022 Scale and international reach of connectivity\n\u2022 Comprehensiveness of platform offerings\n\u2022 Ease of deployment and implementation\n\u2022 Scalability and reliability of service\nPareteum considers itself well-placed to be judged on those criteria. The Company is confident that its network of global and international connectivity partners will enable it to access markets that currently are under-served and compete equally with larger competitors in mature markets. In addition, Pareteum is confident that few other players have the breadth of value-added services to complement the core connectivity platforms, resulting in competitive positioning for each of the areas where it competes:\n\u2022 Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (\u201cMVNE\u201d) services for CSPs: In a fragmented market without large competitors, Pareteum is well-known in the industry for a wide range of platform functionalities and high-flexibility to adapt to customer needs and accommodate complex requirements at a competitive price. As a result, Pareteum is serving leading CSPs in Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, Latin American and Africa, untapping solid growth potential in each of these markets.\n\u2022 Wi-Fi Connectivity aggregation for Enterprise customers: Pareteum has built an extensive Wi-Fi footprint with exclusive deals, covering more hotels, airports, business, leisure and outdoor areas. Pareteum offers a unified user experience with seamless access across Wi-Fi hotspots to blue chip customers, with a variety of successful business models.\n\u2022 Short Message Service Application-To-Person (\u201cSMS A2P\u201d) messaging for Enterprise customers: Leveraging global connectivity agreements enabling competitive price points and a strong competitive position in Europe, Pareteum offers fully programmable B2C messaging across a wide range of mobile and social channels with simple Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) integration.\n\u2022 IoT connectivity platform for IoT solution providers: Leveraging on the above capabilities, Pareteum is in an advantageous position to build a unique proposition for IoT solution providers that would benefit from the large growth potential in IoT. The foundations are in place and Pareteum has already received very positive commercial traction.\nNevertheless, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources, as well as greater brand and market awareness, and consequently may be able to react more quickly to competitive pressures. As we execute on our growth strategies, and enter new markets, or disrupt markets and replace incumbents, we expect competition to become more intense.\nOne key tenet in our competitive strategy, however, is to actually lower the competitive barriers to market for new customers to create new mobility and communications applications and businesses. We intend to disrupt existing markets and have the advantage of quick time-to-market for those newly enabled business models and opportunities. These include, for example:\n\u2022 Uniquely tailored data services such as unlimited social media, messaging apps or streaming music services.\n\u2022 Global roaming connectivity without local infrastructure: e.g., business executives using a multi-SIM worldwide phone.\n\u2022 Creation of personal, branded, mobile services.\n\u2022 One-stop shop for bundles of IoT and machine-to-machine (\u201cM2M\u201d) services: through plug-ins to multiple vertical applications and specialized platforms. One-stop shop for current and next-gen Global System for Mobile (\u201cGSM\u201d) communications and Wi-Fi connectivity, deployed seamlessly through our CPaaS solutions.\nRegulatory\nPareteum is subject to several U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, telecommunications, trade and export sanctions or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and may be tested or varied in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving markets in which we operate. Because applicable international laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we, our products or our platform may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.\nPrivacy and Data Protection\nThe regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and security issues worldwide is complex and rapidly evolving and as a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These data privacy laws and regulations are especially relevant and applicable to us as a technology company because we process vast amounts of personal and non-personal data on behalf of our customers and we also host significant and increasing amounts of data in our cloud solutions. The application of existing laws to cloud-based solutions is particularly uncertain and cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, the impact of which cannot be fully understood at this time. Moreover, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data processing and privacy practices. Complying with these various laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nBecause the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, other claims and penalties, significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our services and platform capabilities and/or implement additional organizational and technical measures, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny failure by us, our suppliers or other parties with whom we do business to comply with our contractual commitments, policies or with federal, state, local or international regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental, regulatory and supervisory authorities or others. In many jurisdictions (especially the European Union), enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. In the U.S., these include enforcement actions in response to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies, state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies. In addition, security advocates and industry groups have regularly proposed, and may propose in the future, self-regulatory standards with which we must legally comply or that contractually apply to us. If we fail to follow these security standards even if no personal information is compromised, we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs.\nInternationally, most jurisdictions in which we operate, have established or strengthened their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply, including but not limited to the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) and Switzerland. The EU\u2019s and UK\u2019s data protection landscape changed significantly in 2018, resulting in significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business. The EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect back in May 2018, and together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU, UK and Switzerland, ushered in a new and complex data protection regime including principles, rights and obligations with extraterritorial reach of EU, UK and Swiss data protection authorities. The European data protection and security laws, including GDPR, provide for extensive data subject rights, robust obligations on data controllers and processors and additional requirements on businesses to put in place data protection and security compliance programs, systems and processes. Continued evolvement of, and varied implementation and interpretation of such European data protection and security laws has increased, and continues to extend, our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet these requirements and our obligations under such laws. Among other requirements, the GDPR (and its UK equivalent commonly referred to as \u201cUK GDPR\u201d) regulates transfers of personal data (subject to such laws) from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) and the UK to the U.S. as well as other third countries outside EEA and the UK which are deemed not to provide adequate standards of data protection to the levels required by GDPR. The recent European Court of Justice judgement in July 2020 which nullified the EU-US Privacy Shield, its critical remarks about lack of data protection safeguards for non-US nationals, and subsequent and consequent measures taken by European data protection regulators in response to this judgement, has increased uncertainty in respect of data transfers from the EEA, UK and Switzerland to the US, creating serious challenges, uncertainties and increased costs for businesses such as ours. The GDPR and UK GDPR also impose numerous privacy-related obligations and requirements for companies operating in the EU and the UK including requiring data controllers not to transfer personal data to US-based processors unless they agree to certain legally binding processing obligations, greater control for data subjects (for example, the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d), increased data portability for EU and UK consumers, data breach notification requirements and exposure to substantial fines for non-compliance. Under the GDPR and UK GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual global revenue of the non-compliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR\u2019s and UK GDPR\u2019s requirements. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by customers and data subjects. The frequency and quantum of fines imposed by EU and UK data protection regulators under GDPR and UK GDPR has been increasing since 2019. The GDPR and UK GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and affiliates, including employee personal data.\nOn January 31, 2020, the UK ceased to be a member of the EU, an event generally referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. Following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, the UK left the EU Single Market and Customs Union, and is no longer subject to EU law or a party to the EU\u2019s trade agreements. Effective from 1 January 2021, the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between the UK and the EU, as it existed before 31 December 2020, ended and the EU and the UK now form two separate markets; two distinct regulatory and legal spaces. This will create barriers to trade in goods, services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges (including data) that did not exist prior to 31 December 2020.\nEven though the UK reached an agreement with the EU on the terms of their future cooperation, as reflected in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) and related documents, and the UK government has sought to reproduce the effects of the EU trading agreements and EU laws (including the implementation of GDPR into UK law (now commonly referred to as UK GDPR) that previously applied to it, material changes took effect from 1 January 2021. It is unclear how the TCA will actually be implemented, how it will affect the nature of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU and how it will impact our business. It is also unclear how the UK\u2019s new arrangements with other countries will actually be implemented and the coverage of those agreements. The effects of this uncertainty will continue to impact the political and economic environment in the UK and across other EU member states, and may impair our ability to transact business. This uncertainty could also continue to affect the UK, the EU and worldwide economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global financial markets, and the value of the pound sterling or other currencies, including the Euro.\nAdditionally, now that the UK and EU regulatory and legal spaces are distinct and separate, the regulatory frameworks of the UK and the EU may subsequently change and potentially divergent laws and regulations may develop, including those relating to data protection and security. This may have adverse practical and/or operational implications for our business which involves data processing and cross-border data transfers, including the potential disruption to data transfers, additional compliance and operational costs and necessary operational changes.\nAlthough the current arrangements between the EU and UK permit flow of data between these two regions for a period of up to 6 months from 1 January 2021, the European Commission has not yet made any determination as to whether UK is a safe country for personal data transfer. Even if such finding is made, with the UK not required to follow EU laws, there is an increased risk of divergence in data protection and security laws (and related guidance) between the UK and the EU, with the possibility of EU restricting data flows to the UK and vice versa. This has the potential to cause disruption to data transfers and our operations and result in additional compliance and operational costs.\nNon-compliance with relevant data privacy laws, directives and regulations, such as the GDPR and UK GDPR, could result in proceedings against us by governmental regulatory and supervisory authorities, customers, suppliers, data subjects and others. We may also experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new European or multi-national customers due to the legal requirements, concerns about US data protection safeguards for non-US nationals, compliance cost, potential risk exposure and uncertainty for these entities and businesses, and we may experience significantly increased liability with respect to these customers pursuant to the terms set forth in our engagements with them.\nU.S. federal and state laws in this area are also complex and developing rapidly. Many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. In addition, laws in all 50 states require businesses to provide notice to customers whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. The laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly. States are also constantly amending existing laws, requiring attention to frequently changing regulatory requirements. Further, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and imposes obligations on companies that process personal information of California residents. The CCPA was amended prior to going into effect, and it is possible that further amendments will be enacted, but even in its current form it remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. Among other things, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nBecause the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, other claims and penalties, significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our services and platform capabilities and/or implement additional organizational and technical measures, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, regulations, contractual obligations and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and have a material and adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, contractual obligations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our services. Privacy and data security concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our services, particularly in certain industries and foreign countries. If we are not able to adjust to changing laws, regulations and standards related to the Internet, our business may be harmed.\nTelecommunications Regulations\nCurrently, few existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the Internet, other than laws generally applicable to businesses. Many Internet-related laws and regulations, however, are pending and may be adopted in the U.S., in individual states and local jurisdictions and in other countries. These laws may relate to many areas that impact our business, including encryption, network and information security, and the convergence of traditional communication services, such as telephone services, with Internet communications, taxes and wireless networks. These types of regulations could differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions both inside and outside the U.S. Non-U.S. countries and political organizations may impose, or favor, more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the U.S., thus furthering the complexity of regulation. Certain countries have implemented, or may implement, legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the Internet, including the ability of Internet Service Providers to limit access to specific websites or content. In addition, state and local governments within the U.S. may impose regulations in addition to, inconsistent with, or stricter than federal regulations. The adoption of such laws or regulations, and uncertainties associated with their validity, interpretation, applicability and enforcement, may affect the available distribution channels for, and the costs associated with, our products and services. The adoption of such laws and regulations may harm our business.\nCorporate Information\nPareteum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was originally formed in 2001 as Elephant Talk Communications Corp. as a result of a merger between Staruni Corporation (USA, 1962) and Elephant Talk Limited (Hong Kong, 1994).\nIn December 2011, the Company moved its listing from the OTCBB to the NYSE MKT (now known as the NYSE American) and its stock began trading at that time under the ticker symbol \u201cETAK.\u201d\nFollowing approval at the Company\u2019s 2016 annual stockholders\u2019 meeting, the Company was rebranded and formally renamed to \u201cPareteum Corporation\u201d and on November 3, 2016, the Company\u2019s ticker symbol on the NYSE American was changed to \u201cTEUM.\u201d On October 23, 2018, the Company moved its listing to The Nasdaq Capital Market under its current ticker symbol \u201cTEUM.\u201d On November 10, 2020, Nasdaq notified the Company by letter that the Company\u2019s common stock would be delisted and, accordingly, trading of the Company\u2019s common stock on Nasdaq\u2019s Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on November 12, 2020 and prices for the Company\u2019s common stock have since been quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s Pink Open Market.

    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical consolidated financial statements, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report and \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in the forepart of this Annual Report.\nBusiness Overview\nPareteum Corporation (OTC: TEUM) is a growth-oriented cloud software communications platform company with a mission - to Connect Every Person and Every(Thing) \u2122. Pareteum\u2019s goal is to unleash the power of applications and mobile services, bringing secure, ubiquitous, scalable, and seamlessly available voice, video, SMS/text messaging, and data services to its customers, making worldwide communications services easily and economically accessible to everyone. By harnessing the value of our cloud communications platform, Pareteum serves enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, IoT and telecommunications infrastructure providers.\nPareteum integrates a variety of disparate communications methods and services and offers them to customers and application developers, allowing communications to become a value-added service. The vast majority of our platform is comprised of our internally-developed software and intellectual property, which provides our customers with flexibility in how they use our products and allows us to be market driven going forward. We have been granted over 70 patents related to techniques and processes which support our cloud software and communications platform solutions. Our platform services partners (whose technologies are integrated into our cloud) include Hewlett Packard, IBM, Sonus, Oracle, Microsoft, NetNumber, Affirmed and other world-class technology providers.\nThe Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, MVNO, Smart Cities, and Application developer markets - each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity. These sectors need Communications-Platform-as-a-Service (CPaaS), which Pareteum delivers. Our vision is to empower Communication Service Providers, Enterprises and Developers to simply create and control their own wireless communications products and experiences through our powerful combination of software, services and global connectivity.\nPareteum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was originally formed in 2001 as Elephant Talk Communications Corp. as a result of a merger between Staruni Corporation (USA, 1962) and Elephant Talk Limited (Hong Kong, 1994). Since 2016, our name has been Pareteum Corporation, and from November 12, 2019 until November 12, 2020, our common stock was traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol \u201cTEUM.\u201d Prices for our common stock are now quoted on the Pink Sheets under the same symbol.\nRestatement and Revision of Previously Issued Interim Financial Statements\nWe restated the unaudited quarterly financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019. The impact of the restatement is reflected in this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d), see the discussion below in \u201cConsolidated Quarterly Results\u201d. The Company has not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2019 with the SEC.\nDelisting of the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nOn November 5, 2020, the Company notified the Nasdaq Hearings Panel that it would not be able to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2019, its amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 or its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 by November 9, 2020, the date by which the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had required the Company to make such filings in order for the Company\u2019s common stock to remain listed on Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn response to the Company\u2019s notice to the Nasdaq Stock Market that it would not satisfy the conditions to the exception to the listing requirements granted by the Hearing Panel, the Nasdaq Stock Market notified the Company by letter dated November 10, 2020 that the Company\u2019s common stock would be delisted, and trading of the Company\u2019s common stock on Nasdaq\u2019s Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on November 12, 2020. Since the trading of the Company\u2019s common stock was suspended, prices for our common stock have been quoted on Pink Sheets.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Annual Results\nOur results of operations for the periods presented were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n($ in thousands) Increase/(Decrease)\nREVENUES $ 62,049 $ 20,258 $ 41,791\nCOST AND OPERATING EXPENSES\nCost of revenues (excluding depreciation and amortization) 47,134 10,054 37,080\nProduct development 12,956 3,083 9,873\nSales and marketing 10,345 3,197 7,148\nGeneral and administrative 34,583 17,330 17,253\nRestructuring and acquisition costs 3,457 7,260 (3,803 )\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets 160,989 - 160,989\nDepreciation and amortization 12,938 5,427 7,511\nTotal cost and operating expenses 282,402 46,351 236,051\nLOSS FROM OPERATIONS (220,353 ) (26,093 ) (194,260 )\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)\nInterest income\nInterest expense (2,120 ) (309 ) (1,811 )\nInterest expense related to debt discount and conversion feature (619 ) (184 ) (435 )\nChanges in derivative liabilities - 1,284 (1,284 )\nLoss on extinguishment of debt (8,873 ) - (8,873 )\nGain on equity investment - 6,371 (6,371 )\nAmortization of deferred financing costs (237 ) (29 ) (208 )\nOther income (expense), net (3,221 ) (3,799 )\nTotal other income (expense) (14,712 ) 7,895 (22,607 )\nLOSS BEFORE BENEFIT FOR INCOME TAXES (235,065 ) (18,198 ) (216,867 )\nIncome tax benefit (8,295 ) (174 ) (8,121 )\nNET LOSS (226,770 ) (18,024 ) (208,746 )\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nForeign currency translation loss (219 ) (200 ) (19 )\nCOMPREHENSIVE LOSS $ (226,989 ) $ (18,224 ) $ (208,765 )\nAlthough the majority of our business activity is carried out in Euros, we report our financial statements in U.S. dollars (\u201cUSD\u201d). The conversion of Euros and USD leads to period-to-period fluctuations in our reported USD results arising from changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the Euro. Generally, when the USD strengthens relative to the Euro, it has an unfavorable impact on our reported revenue and income and a favorable impact on our reported expenses. Conversely, when the USD weakens relative to the Euro, it produces a favorable impact on our reported revenue and income, and an unfavorable impact on our reported expenses. These fluctuations in the USD/Euro exchange rate therefore result in currency translation effects (not to be confused with real currency exchange effects), which impact our reported USD results and may make it difficult to determine actual increases and decreases in our revenue and expenses that are attributable to our actual operating activities. We carry out our business activities primarily in Euros, and we do not currently engage in hedging activities.\nThe following table shows the average USD equivalent of the major currencies used to translate our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nUSD\nEquivalent\nEuro $ 1.14460 $ 1.18102\nBritish Pound $ 1.27369 $ 1.33501\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nRevenue\nWe generate revenues primarily through providing CPaaS solutions to enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, IoT, and telecommunications infrastructure providers. Our solutions are hosted software solutions that generate hosting and subscription revenue. We also offer customer support and professional services related to implementing and supporting our suite of applications. We offer managed services and bundled services for our mobile solutions services. Managed service revenues are recognized monthly based on an average number of end-users managed and is calculated based on a pre-determined service fee per user. For bundled services, we provide both network administration as well as mobile airtime management services. Bundled service revenue is recognized monthly based on an average number of end-users of managed and mobile airtime usage, calculated based on a pre-determined service fee. We also earn revenue from telecommunications services we offer, which revenue is based on a pre-determined rate and number of user minutes and calls that we manage in a given month. We also earn revenue from professional services, including consulting services to support business process mapping, configuration, data migration, integration and training.\nOur total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $62.0 million, an increase of $41.8 million, or 206%, compared to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to the Company\u2019s inclusion of a full year of revenues of Artilium following the acquisition of Artilium in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the addition of iPass revenues following the iPass acquisition in the first quarter of 2019.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications service providers, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues, consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based compensation and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.\nCost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $47.1 million, an increase of $37.1 million, or 369%, compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Similar to the increase in revenues, the increase in cost of revenues in 2019 was primarily due to Company\u2019s acquisitions of Artilium and iPass.\nProduct Development\nProduct development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation expenses, of employees involved in the development of the Company\u2019s services, which are expensed as incurred. Costs such as database architecture, and Pareteum BOSS & IN platform development and testing are included in this function.\nCosts incurred during the application development stage of internal-use software projects, such as those used in the Company\u2019s operations, are capitalized in accordance with the accounting guidance for costs of computer software developed for internal use. Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis. When assigning useful lives to internal-use software, the Company considers the effects of obsolescence, competition, technology, and other economic factors. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company capitalized $6.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively, of internal-use software.\nProduct development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $13.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, an increase of $9.9 million, or 320%, primarily due to the incremental product developments costs of the iPass business acquired in 2019.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners and marketing programs. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building.\nSales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $10.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively, an increase of $7.1 million, or 224%. The increase was due to additions to the sales force as well as the inclusion of the Artilium and iPass sales and marketing expenses in 2019.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses are our largest cost, other than our impairment charge, and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based compensation, for non-employee directors, finance and accounting, legal and human resources personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $34.6 million and $17.3 million, respectively, an increase of $17.3 million, or 100%. An increase in non-cash compensation, staff-related costs and the addition of Artilium and iPass resulted in higher general administrative expenses of $5.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018. In 2019, the Company worked to decrease the compensatory costs from Artilium through identified synergies as a result of the acquisition.\nRestructuring and Acquisition Costs\nRestructuring and acquisition costs for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $3.5 million and $7.3 million, respectively, a decrease of $3.8 million or 52%. The acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $3.5 million related to our acquisition of iPass compared to $7.1 million related to our acquisition of Artilium in 2018.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test. Based on results of the goodwill impairment test, the Company determined that the estimated fair values of two of the Company\u2019s three operating segments, Artilium and iPass, were less than their carrying values. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $129.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to write down the carrying value of its goodwill from $139.2 million to $10.1 million. In determining the estimated fair value of its reporting unit, the Company used the income approach. Under the income approach, the fair value is based on the present value of discounted cash flows projected which includes assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital derived from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical from an operational and economic standpoint. The primary factor contributing to the reduction in the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting unit was a significant decline in projected long-term cash flow projections following the below expectations performance of Artilium and iPass during 2019, which the Company primarily attributes to disruptions caused by an uncertain economic environment.\nBased on the Company\u2019s review for impairment of intangible assets, the Company determined that the carrying values exceeded the fair values by $31.9 million. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $31.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to write down the carrying value of certain intangible assets to $15.5 million. The primary factor contributing to the impairment charge was the significant decline in projected long-term cash flow projections which the Company primarily attributes to disruptions caused by an uncertain economic environment.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $12.9 million and $5.4 million, an increase of $7.5 million, or 138%. The increase is primarily due to the amortization of the intangible assets acquired through the acquisitions of Artilium and iPass.\nInterest Income\nInterest income increased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $2.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, an increase of $1.8 million. The increase results primarily from borrowings under that certain credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Post Road Administrative Finance, LLC and its affiliate Post Road Special Opportunity Fund I LLP (the \u201cPost Road Loan\u201d) entered into February 2019, which was subsequently paid off in conjunction with a securities purchase agreement entered into in September 2019. (see Note 15, Stockholders\u2019 Equity - Securities Purchase Agreement).\nInterest Expense Related to Debt Discount and Conversion Feature\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, interest expenses related to debt discount and conversion features of certain of our exercisable and convertible securities was $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, an increase of $0.4 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of the Post Road Loan Facility in February 2019 that was subsequently paid off in conjunction with a securities purchase agreement entered into in September 2019. (see Note 15, Stockholders\u2019 Equity - Securities Purchase Agreement).\nChanges in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities\nIn 2018, we recognized a revaluation gain of $1.3 million on derivative liabilities associated with a promissory note that was settled in the third quarter of 2018. We did not have a similar transaction in 2019.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nIn 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8.9 million related to the extinguishment of Post Road Loan and Fortress Credit Agreement in September 2019 (see Note 12, Long-term Debt).\nGain on Equity Investment\nIn 2018, we recognized a gain on equity investment that represents the gain in our equity investment in Artilium at its carrying value of $3.2 million at the time of our acquisition of Artilium compared to its acquisition-date fair value of $9.6 million. There is no comparable transaction in 2019.\nAmortization of Deferred Financing Costs\nAmortization of deferred financing costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $0.2 million, compared to a de minimis amount in the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the issuance of the Post Road Loan in February 2019 that was subsequently paid off in September 2019.\nOther Income (expense), net\nOther income (expense) net, is generated from non-operating activities and includes foreign currency gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded other expense, net of $3.2 million compared to other income, net of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $3.8 million was primarily due to the recognition of a reserve on a note receivable and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates on our results in 2018 when compared to 2019.\nIncome Taxes Benefit\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $8.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. This change was primarily due to the full valuation of the deferred tax liability resulting from the Artilium acquisition. On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Artilium and as a result of the purchase price allocation, the Company recorded a net deferred tax liability of $8.6 million for the basis difference on acquired intangible assets and tax attributes from the business combination. The total tax-effected intangible impairment for Artilium in 2019 totaled $17.2 million.\nOther Comprehensive Loss\nWe record foreign currency translation gains and losses as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Foreign currency translation loss for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nConsolidated Quarterly Results Our unaudited quarterly financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, as restated, and the impact of the restatement adjustments are summarized in the following tables.

Our deployments with existing customers continue to grow, new implementations generated new revenues and new cloud-based revenues were all factors in our revenue growth. Additionally, revenues include $8.9 million in revenues from Artilium and iPass which were acquired in October 2018 and February 2019, respectively. Comparable revenues were not reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2018, because these subsidiaries were acquired in subsequent periods.\nComparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nRevenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $16.9 million and $29.9 million; a $13.0 million and $22.4 million, respectively, or 335% and 298%, respectively, increase compared to $3.9 million and $7.5 million, respectively, for the comparable three and six months in 2018. The increase was primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications service providers, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues, consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based compensation and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of service excludes depreciation and amortization.\nComparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.\nCost of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2019 was $8.0 million, an increase of $6.8 million or 571%, compared to $1.2 million for the comparable three-month period in 2018. For the three months ended March 31, 2019, this includes $5.0 million of cost of revenues for Artilium and iPass. Comparable costs were not reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2018, because these subsidiaries were acquired in subsequent periods.\nComparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nCost of revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 was $12.6 million and $20.7 million, respectively, an increase of $10.8 million and $17.7 million, respectively, or 589% and 581%, respectively, compared to $1.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively, for the comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and volume in revenue growth.\nProduct Development\nProduct development costs consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, of employees involved in the development of the Company\u2019s services, which are expensed as incurred. Costs such as database architecture, and Pareteum BOSS & IN platform development and testing are included in this function.\nComparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.\nProduct development costs for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were $2.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, an increase of $1.8 million or 251%. The increase is primarily due to the overall expansion of our lines of business year over year and the inclusion of product development costs of $0.8 million for Artilium and iPass for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Comparable costs were not reflected in the three months ended March 31, 2018, because these subsidiaries were acquired in subsequent periods.\nComparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nProduct development costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $3.6 million and $6.2 million, respectively, an increase of $2.8 million and $4.6 million, respectively, or 351% and 303%, respectively, compared to $0.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for the comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase was due to the overall expansion of our lines of business year over year. The increase in product development costs is primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and overall expansion of our lines of business year over year.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses, including share-based expenses, for our sales and marketing staff, including commissions, payments to partners and marketing programs. Marketing programs consist of advertising, events, corporate communications and brand building.\nComparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.\nSales and marketing expenses for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were $2.9 million and $0.7 million, respectively, an increase of $2.2 million or 317%. This increase is primarily a direct result of hiring new employees, the inclusion of the Artilium and iPass sales and marketing expenses of $0.9 million, and other incremental costs incurred as the Company expanded.\nComparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nSales and marketing expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $3.1 million and $6.0 million, respectively, an increase of $2.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively, or 283% and 299%, respectively, compared to $0.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively, for the comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and hiring new employees and allocating resources to growing our business.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses are typically our largest cost and consist primarily of overhead related salaries and expenses, including share-based compensation, for non-employee directors, finance and accounting, legal, internal audit and human resources personnel, legal costs, professional fees and other corporate expenses.\nComparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were $7.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, an increase of $6.1 million or 334%. These increases were primarily due to the inclusion of general and administrative expenses for Artilium and iPass of $3.6 million and increase in personnel costs including share-based compensation expense.\nComparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2019 were $8.4 million and $16.3 million, respectively, an increase of $6.1 million and $12.2 million, respectively, or 271% and 299%, respectively, compared to $2.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively, for the comparable three- and six-month periods in 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to acquisition of Artilium and iPass that occurred subsequent to the same period in 2018 and increase in personnel costs including share-based compensation expense.\nRestructuring and Acquisition Charges\nComparison of three months ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018.\nRestructuring and acquisition charges for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were $3.3 million and $0.1 million, an increase of $3.2 million. The costs incurred in 2019 were primarily the result of the iPass acquisition which was completed on February 12, 2019.\nComparison of three months and six months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.\nRestructuring and acquisition charges for the three months ended June 30, 2019 were $0.1 million. Restructuring and acquisition costs of $3.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 were comprised predominantly of acquisition costs related to the acquisition of iPass that was completed on February 12, 2019 and to a lesser extent, restructuring charges following the acquisitions of Artilium and iPass.\nRestructuring and acquisition charges for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2018 were not significant.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company reported net losses of $226.8 million and $18.0 million for the years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively, and had an accumulated deficit of $543.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and $317.1 million as of December 31, 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $129.1 million and intangible assets impairment of $31.9 million.\nThe cash balance, including restricted cash and cash, of the Company at December 31, 2019 was $5.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, our cash balance, including restricted cash, was $6.5 million.\nOn June 8, 2020, we issued a $17.5 million 8% Senior Secured Convertible Note (the \u201cHigh Trail Note\u201d) to High Trail Investments SA LLC (\u201cHigh Trail\u201d) due April 1, 2025 for an aggregate purchase price of $14 million, of which $7 million is currently maintained in one or more blocked accounts. The terms of the High Trail Note and related documents require the Company to meet certain specified conditions and covenants, some of which have not been satisfied by the dates required, including (i) the Company filing its restated financial statements with the SEC for (a) the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, (b) the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and (c) the quarter ended June 30, 2019, in each case on or prior to October 31, 2020, (ii) after October 31, 2020, the Company timely filing its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or its subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC in the manner and within the time periods required under the Exchange Act and (iii) the Company maintaining the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market. As a result, on December 1, 2020, we entered into a forbearance agreement (the \u201cForbearance Agreement\u201d) with High Trail under which: (i) we admitted that we were in default of several obligations under the High Trail Note and related agreements, (ii) High Trail acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note or the related securities purchase agreement, warrant or security documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the High Trail Note, until the earlier of December 31, 2020 (since extended to March 31, 2021), the date of any new event of default or initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in the Forbearance Agreement. As a result of the defaults, the interest rate paid on the principal outstanding under the High Trail Note increased to 18% per annum. As partial consideration for its agreement to not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail financing documents, we agreed with High Trail to make certain changes to the High Trail Note and related agreements. In this regard, we agreed to delete the \u201cFloor Price\u201d of $0.10 that had previously limited the number of shares of Company common stock into which (i) the outstanding indebtedness could be converted upon default and (ii) payments of interest could be made. We also agreed to increase the number of shares it was required to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the High Trail Note and to decrease the exercise price of the related warrant from $0.58 to $0.37.\nOn February 22, 2021, the Company closed the issuance of $2.4 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Second Lien Secured Convertible Notes due 2025 (the \u201cSecond Lien Notes\u201d). The Second Lien Notes were sold under the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 22, 2021, entered into by and between the Company and an institutional investor. The aggregate purchase price for the Second Lien Notes and related warrant to purchase common stock was $2.0 million. The Second Lien Notes are senior, secured obligations of the Company, but rank junior to the High Trail Note. Interest is payable monthly beginning April 1, 2021 at a rate of 8% per annum. The Second Lien Notes are secured by a second lien on substantially all assets of the Company and substantially all assets of its material U.S.-organized subsidiaries. Interest may be paid, at the election of the Company, in cash or in shares of common stock of the Company; provided, that, so long as the High Trail Note remains outstanding, such payments may only be made in shares. The number of shares issuable to pay interest in shares is determined by the application of a formula in which the amount of the interest due is divided by 85% of the lowest volume-weighted average price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the principal market for the Company\u2019s common stock over the 10 days preceding the date of such payment.\nSubject to an intercreditor agreement with the holder of the High Trail Note, upon notice by the Company, the Company may elect to redeem all or a portion of the then-outstanding principal amount outstanding under the Second Lien Note. The holder of the Second Lien Note or the Company may also elect for the Company to redeem the Second Lien Notes at a 20% premium if the Company undergoes a fundamental change. The Second Lien Notes will be convertible into shares of common stock, in part or in whole, from time to time, at the election of the holder of the Second Lien Notes. The initial conversion rate is 1666.6667 shares of Company common stock for each $1,000 of principal amount of Second Lien Notes. The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments in the event the Company issues stock dividends or effects a split or reverse split of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nBecause of the limited nature of the relief provided under the Forbearance Agreement, which does not lower the amounts payable in principal or interest, and the limited amount of additional capital we raised by selling the Second Lien Notes, we believe that we will not have sufficient resources to fund our operations and meet the obligations specified in the note for the next twelve months following the filing of this Annual Report. Our software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise.\nAs a result, we believe that additional capital will be required to fund our operations and provide growth capital to meet the obligations under the High Trail Note. Accordingly, we will have to raise additional capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed, this would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Furthermore, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted world financial markets, has negatively impacted U.S. market conditions and may reduce opportunities for us to seek out additional funding. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock, coupled with the stock\u2019s delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, could make it more difficult to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.\nOperating Activities\nWe reported net cash used in operating activities of $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $7.8 million in 2018, an increase in cash used of $9.9 million. Operating activities decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in net operating results after the add back of the $161.0 million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and $8.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt as well as the amortization of deferred financing costs, share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and change in fair value of warrant liability.\n($ in thousands)\nNet loss $ (226,770 ) $ (18,024 )\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities: 192,617 5,511\n(34,153 ) (12,513 )\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities: 16,392 4,693\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (17,761 ) $ (7,820 )\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2019, was $11.1 million, a decrease of $0.4 million or 3%, compared to $11.5 million net cash used in investing activities in 2018. This decrease is a result of an all common stock acquisition of iPass in the year ended December 31, 2019 partially offset by an increase in capitalized software, notes receivable issued to a third party, and assets purchased from Devicescape Holdings, Inc.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $28.3 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Financing activities increased as a result of the Company\u2019s issuance of common equity and redeemable preferred stock offset by repayment of loans issued during the current year and the repayment of debt held by iPass as of the date of the acquisition.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into certain off-balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (\u201cunconditional purchase obligations\u201d). We entered into the Strategic Connectivity Agreement (the \u201cConnectivity Agreement\u201d) with Hutchison 3G UK Limited (\u201c3UK\u201d) on July 23, 2019. Under the Connectivity Agreement, we are obligated to pay 3UK $0.6 million for the implementation of a MVNO (the \u201c3UK MVNO\u201d), and for monthly services provided, based on usage, after the 3UK MVNO is launched, which we anticipate to be in the third quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2019, $0.1 million was invoiced by 3UK and is recorded in Accrued expenses and other payables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019. Of the remaining unconditional purchase obligation to 3UK outstanding as of December 31, 2019, we expect to incur $0.1 million in 2020 and the remainder in 2021.\nConcurrent with the execution of the Connectivity Agreement, we entered into the Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of Credit Voucher (the \u201cCredit Voucher Agreement\u201d) with PCCW Global Limited (\u201cPCCW\u201d) under which we are obligated to purchase a credit voucher for $28.0 million. The credit voucher will be used to offset certain monthly service charges incurred under the Connectivity Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, $0.6 million of the purchase price has been recorded in Accrued expenses and other payables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining $27.5 million unconditional purchase obligation is due and payable following the launch date of the 3UK MVNO, with minimum aggregate payments due as of June 30th, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025.\nSee Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies for additional details about these off-balance sheet arrangements.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nRevenue Recognition and Net billings in Excess of Revenues\nRevenue represents amounts earned for (non-software) arrangements consisting of hosting subscriptions for our CPaaS solutions. We also offer customer support and professional services related to implementing and supporting our suite of applications. Revenues generally are recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nMonthly Service Revenues:\nThe Company\u2019s performance obligations in monthly Software as a Service (SaaS) and service offerings are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer and therefore, are recognized over time. For recognition purposes, we do not unbundle such services into separate performance obligations. The Company typically bills its customer at the end of each month, with payment to be received shortly thereafter. The fees charged may include a combination of fixed and variable charges with the variable charges tied to the number of subscribers or some other measure of volume. Although the consideration may be variable, the volumes are estimable at the time of billing, with \u201ctrue-up\u201d adjustments occurring in the subsequent month. Such amounts have not been historically significant.\nInstallation and Software Development Revenues:\nThe Company\u2019s other revenues consist generally of installation and software development projects.\nInstallation represents the activities necessary for a customer to obtain access and connectivity to the Company\u2019s monthly SaaS and service offerings. While installation may require separate phases, it represents one promise within the context of the contract.\nSoftware development consists of programming and other services which adds new functionality to a customer\u2019s existing or new service offerings. Each development project defines its milestones and will have its own performance obligation.\nRevenue is recognized over time if the installation and software development activities create an asset that has no alternative use for which the Company is entitled to receive payment for performance completed to date. If not, then revenue is not recognized until the applicable performance obligation is satisfied.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations:\nThe Company\u2019s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nContract assets and liabilities:\nGiven the nature of the Company\u2019s services and contracts, it has no contract assets. The Company records net billings in excess of revenues when payments are made in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable.\nPayment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before control is transferred or services are delivered to the customer.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes origination, termination, network and billing charges from telecommunications operators, costs of telecommunications service providers, materials and supplies, network costs, data center costs, facility cost of hosting network and equipment and cost in providing resale arrangements with long distance service providers, cost of leasing transmission facilities, international gateway switches for voice, data transmission services, and the cost of professional services of staff directly related to the generation of revenues, consisting primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, including share-based expenses and the cost of subcontractors. Cost of revenues excludes depreciation and amortization.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe record an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts in an amount approximating anticipated losses. Accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers. An allowance is recorded on the basis of loss experience, known and inherent risk in the account balance and current economic conditions. Individual uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance when collection of the individual accounts appears doubtful.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our income taxes separately for each tax jurisdiction in which we conduct operations. The provision for federal, state, foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In determining the net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, we are required to make judgments and estimates in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. If we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes.\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 718 Compensation-Stock Compensation (\u201cASC 718\u201d). Under ASC 718, share-based awards are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized as expense with an adjustment for forfeiture over the employee\u2019s requisite service period (the vesting period, generally three years), which the Company amortizes on a straight-line basis.\nFor both contractors and advisory board members, we recognize the guidance for share-based compensation awards to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50 Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees (\u201cASC 505-50\u201d). Under ASC 505-50, we determine the fair value of the options or share-based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received, or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable.\nShare-based compensation (cash and non-cash) related to equity plans for employees and non-employee directors are included within our cost of revenues and operating expenses.\nWarrant and Conversion feature derivative liabilities\nWarrants and convertible notes that are accounted for as derivative liabilities are remeasured at fair value each reporting period in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d). The Company utilizes the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the value of the outstanding warrants and the conversion feature in the convertible notes. Since the Monte Carlo valuation model requires special software and expertise to model the assumptions to be used, the Company uses a third-party valuation expert to fair value the derivative liabilities.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition, under the purchase method of accounting. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair value of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially decrease our operating income and net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment, or one level below the operating segment. We operate in one reportable segment.\nWe test for an indication of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or sooner, when indicators of impairment exist, by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If there is an indication of impairment, we perform a \u201cstep two\u201d test to measure the impairment. Impairments, if any, are recorded to the statement of operations in the period the impairment is recognized.\nA significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators include a sustained and significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate and unanticipated competition.\nIn accordance with ASC 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\u201cASC 350\u201d), intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets, between three and ten years. Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, on an annual basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Measurement of any impairment loss for long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use, is based on the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nContingent Losses\nFrom time to time, during the normal course of operations, we are party to litigation and regulatory matters, claims and other contingent matters. Litigation and regulatory reviews can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex proceedings and reviews are difficult to predict and our view of these matters may change in the future as events related thereto unfold. We expense legal fees as incurred. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount or range of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal or regulatory matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements.",

In 2019, the Business and Strategy Committee did not engage any such compensation consultants or advisers.\nDirector and Officer Qualifications\nWe have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met by each of our officers or directors or specific qualities or skills that are necessary for one or more of our officers or members of the Board of Directors to possess. However, our Nominating Committee generally evaluates and recommends candidates with a focus on the following qualities: educational background, ethnic and gender diversity, breadth of professional experience, knowledge of our industry and business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom and ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders and other stakeholders.\nOur Board of Directors and officers are composed of a diverse group of leaders. In their prior positions they have gained experience in core management skills, such as strategic and financial planning, public company financial reporting, compliance, risk management, and leadership development. Most of our officers and directors also have experience serving on boards of directors and board committees of other public companies or private companies, and have an understanding of corporate governance practices and trends, which provides an understanding of different business processes, challenges and strategies. We are also dedicated to maintaining and enhancing the knowledge and skills of our directors.\nThe following matrix summarizes our director nominees\u2019 individual experiences, skills and characteristics. This summary is not an exhaustive list of each nominee\u2019s contributions to the Board. However, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee utilized this matrix in determining the individuals selected for nomination.\nGender Public\nCompany\nReporting\nExperience M&A\nExperience Technology\nBusiness &\nIndustry\nExperience Legal\nExpertise Strategic\nExperience Cybersecurity\nExpertise\nMary Beth Vitale F \u221a \u221a \u221a\n\u221a \u221a\nLuis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on M \u221a \u221a \u221a\n\u221a\nRobert L. Lippert M \u221a \u221a\n\u221a\nRobert H. Turner M \u221a \u221a \u221a\nIndependence Standards for Directors\nThere are no arrangements between our directors and any other person pursuant to which our directors were nominated or elected for their positions.\nThree of our current directors, Luis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Robert L. Lippert and Mary Beth Vitale are \u201cindependent\u201d under Nasdaq rules. All of the individuals nominated for election at the Meeting are \u201cindependent\u201d under Nasdaq rules. Each of Messrs. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on and Lippert and Ms. Vitale serve on the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating Committee and the Strategy and Business Committee. Our Interim Non-Executive Chairman, Ms. Vitale, is independent.\nIn addition, Mr. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Mr. Lippert and Ms. Vitale qualify as \u201cindependent\u201d under the standards established by the SEC for members of audit committees. The Board of Directors has determined that Robert L. Lippert and Mary Beth Vitale is each an \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Stockholders should understand that this designation is a disclosure requirement of the SEC related to these individuals\u2019 experience and understanding with respect to certain accounting and auditing matters. The designation does not impose upon Mr. Lippert or Ms. Vitale any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than those generally imposed on them as a member of the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, and their designation as audit committee financial experts pursuant to this SEC requirement does not affect the duties, obligations, or liability of any other member of the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors also determined that Mr. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Mr. Lippert and Ms. Vitale have sufficient knowledge in reading and understanding financial statements to serve on the Audit Committee.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Executive Sessions\nThe positions of Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are currently held by different persons, although the Board does not have a policy on whether or not the roles of Chief Executive Officer and chairperson of the Board should be separate and, if they are to be separate, whether the chairperson should be selected from the non-employee directors or be an employee of the Company. Accordingly, our Board reserves the right to vest the responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer and Chair in the same person or in two different individuals depending on what it believes is in our best interest. At this time, our Board has determined that separation of these roles most appropriately suits us. The Board will, however, appoint a lead director if the Chair and Chief Executive Officer roles are in the future combined, to conduct executive sessions, and Chair the Board if the Chief Executive Officer is unavailable and for such other purposes as the board finds useful.\nThe Board\u2019s policy is to periodically hold executive sessions without the presence of management, including the Chief Executive Officer or other non-independent directors. In general, time is reserved during each regularly scheduled Board meeting should the outside directors wish to meet in private executive session. When the outside directors meet without a non-independent chairperson of the Board, the lead director shall chair the meeting. The outside directors may also meet at such other times as determined by the presiding director.\nRisk Oversight\nOur Business and Strategy Committee and our Audit Committee share responsibility for oversight of risk management, with members of management also playing a key role. Our Business and Strategy Committee is responsible for the oversight of the Company\u2019s overall enterprise risk management, risk profile and risk assessment, although it coordinates with other committees of the Board, and the full Board, as it from time to time deems appropriate. The Business and Strategy Committee also oversees risk in the areas of corporate strategy and corporate growth and development. Our Audit Committee also assists the full Board in overseeing, approving and monitoring the company-wide enterprise risks identified by various levels of management and the Board. These risks generally cover, but are not limited to: compliance, environmental, financial, operational, reputational, as well as digital risks (fraud, cybersecurity and network). Management is responsible for developing a plan to monitor, assign ownership and respond to early threats and for communicating the methods and processes to manage and leverage opportunities associated with each risk on a regular cadence with the Board. With respect to high-risk areas, we have directed management to present detailed mitigation activities to the Board on an annual basis.\nThe Audit Committee has also directed management to develop a risk management policy, which plan must be submitted and approved on an annual basis by such committee. The risk management plan is required to consider the maturity of the risk management of the Company, to be tailored to the specific circumstances of the Company, include the Company\u2019s risk management structure, the standards and methodology adopted, risk management guidelines, reference to integration and details of the assurance and review of the risk management process.\nEmployee, Officer and Director Hedging\nThe Company\u2019s Insider Trading Policy and our Corporate Governance Guidelines contain restrictions on the ability of directors, officers, and employees to engage in certain transactions that hedge or modify the effect of any transaction in Company securities. Specifically, our Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit such persons from (i) selling the Company\u2019s securities short, (ii) buying or selling put or call options, or other derivative securities, with respect to the Company\u2019s securities, (iii) engaging in transactions that hedge or offset or that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of shares of the Company\u2019s stock (or the stock of any of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries) granted to such persons as compensation or otherwise held by such persons either directly or indirectly, including through the purchase of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds and (iv) holding any Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as collateral for any loan.\nAttendance at Board, Committee and Stockholder Meetings\nOur Board of Directors met in person and telephonically 5 times during 2019 and acted by unanimous written consent14 times during 2019. Each of the then-members of our Board of Directors was present at 75% or more of the Board of Directors meetings held in 2019.\nWe have encouraged, but do not require, that all of our directors be in attendance at our annual shareholder meeting either in person or by remote communication. In 2019, Mr. van Sante, via teleconference, attended the annual stockholder meeting.\nStockholder Communications to the Board\nGenerally, stockholders who have questions, concerns, or wish to address questions regarding our business directly to the Board, or any individual director, should direct his or her questions in writing to Pareteum Corporation, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10036, attention: Secretary. The office of the Secretary will receive the correspondence and forward it to the director or directors to whom the communication is addressed. From time to time, the Board may change the process or means by which stockholders may communicate with the Board or its members. Please refer to our website, www.pareteum.com, for any changes in this process.\nItems that are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board may be excluded, such as:\n\u2022 junk mail and mass mailings;\n\u2022 resumes and other forms of job inquiries;\n\u2022 surveys; and\n\u2022 solicitations or advertisements.\nIn addition, any material that is unduly hostile, threatening, or illegal in nature may be excluded, provided that any communication that is filtered out will be made available to any independent director upon request.\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock (referred to herein as the \u201creporting persons\u201d) file with the SEC various reports disclosing their ownership of, and any transactions relating to, our common stock. Such reporting persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports filed on their behalf. Based solely upon a review of copies of Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed with the SEC on behalf of reporting persons and representations received by us from reporting persons, and without conducting any additional independent investigation of our own, we have determined that the following holdings and transactions of reporting persons were, due to administrative error, not timely reported:\nIn 2019, Form 4s reporting the following transactions were not timely filed: the acquisition by Robert Lippert of restricted stock granted on January 1, 2019, which was subsequently reported in a Form 4 filed January 22, 2020; the acquisition by each of Denis McCarthy, Mr. Lippert, Yves van Sante, Vic Bozzo and Edward O\u2019Donnell of stock options granted January 2, 2019, each grant was subsequently reported in a Form 4 filed May 17, 2019; the acquisition by each Mr. Lippert, Luis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on and Mr. van Sante of Company common stock as compensation for board service in lieu of cash on January 2, 2019, each acquisition was subsequently reported in a Form 4 filed May 17, 2019; the acquisition by Mr. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on of restricted stock granted on January 2, 2019, which was subsequently reported in a Form 4 filed May 17, 2019; the acquisition by Mr. van Sante of stock options granted January 3, 2019, which was subsequently reported in a Form 4 filed January 22, 2020; and the acquisition by Laura Thomas of common stock on April 25, 2019 and stock options that were granted August 21, 2019 and subsequently revoked by mutual agreement between Ms. Thomas and the Company, each acquisition was subsequently reported in a Form 4 filed June 12, 2020.

    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nPareteum Corporation (OTC: TEUM) is a cloud software communications platform company with a mission - to Connect Every Person and Every(Thing)\u2122.\nMillions of people and devices are connected around the world using Pareteum\u2019s global cloud software communications platform, enhancing their mobile experience. Pareteum\u2019s goal is to unleash the power of applications and mobile services, which we believe will bring secure, ubiquitous, scalable, and seamlessly available voice, video, SMS/text messaging, and data services to our customers, making worldwide communications services easily and economically accessible to everyone. By harnessing the value of our cloud communications platform, Pareteum serves enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, Internet-of-Things (\u201cIoT\u201d), and telecommunications infrastructure providers.\nWith estimates of up to 30 billion devices to be managed and connected according to ABI Research, a market research firm that specializes in global connectivity and emerging technology, the total available market is vast. Service providers, brand marketing companies, and enterprise and IoT providers use Pareteum\u2019s cloud communication services and turnkey solutions featuring relevant content, applications, and connectivity worldwide. Pareteum integrates a variety of disparate communications methods and services and offers them to customers and application developers, allowing communications to become a value-added service. We believe that this is a major strategic goal for many industries, from legacy telecommunications providers to the disruptive technology and data enterprises of today and the future.\nThe vast majority of our platform is comprised of our internally-developed software and intellectual property, which provides our customers with flexibility in how they use our products and allows us to be market-driven going forward. We have been granted more than 70 patents related to techniques and processes that support our cloud software and communications platform solutions. Our platform services partners (whose technologies are integrated into our cloud) include: Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, AT&T, Amazon Web Services, Sonus, Veniam, Oracle, Microsoft, NetNumber, Affirmed Networks and other world-class technology providers.\nPareteum is a mission-focused company that seeks to empower \u201cEvery Person and Every(Thing)\u201d to be globally connected, hence our slogan - ANY DEVICE, ANY NETWORK, ANYWHERE\u2122. The Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, Enablers and Aggregators (\u201cMVNO,\u201d \u201cMVNE\u201d and \u201cMVNA\u201d), Smart Cities, and application developer markets, each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity. These sectors need Communications Platform-as-a-Service (\u201cCPaaS\u201d), which Pareteum delivers.\nCoronavirus Pandemic\nIn March 2020, COVID-19 began spreading across the globe and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization; the President of the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) declared this a national emergency. The economic effects of the pandemic and resulting social changes are not predictable. There are a number of uncertainties arising from COVID-19 that have impacted and could continue to impact our operating results: the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation measures, the duration of the pandemic, the pace and effectiveness of vaccination efforts, and the effect on global economic conditions. Likewise, business operational changes, work from home, school from home and shop from home all impact consumer confidence and the availability of supply chains to support these activities. We expect our operating and financial results to continue to be impacted by COVID-19 for the duration of the pandemic.\nWe have seen an increase in usage consumption, particularly for messaging and consumer mobile services during the pandemic. However, our products and services for customers in the travel and hospitality industries have been and continue to be negatively impacted. We expect volatility in customer demand and consumption habits as the pandemic continues, and we may experience constrained supply or curtailed customer demand that could adversely impact our operations. Specifically, we have seen slowing sales cycles, including customers and prospective customers delaying contracts or renewals. Customers in the pipeline are uncertain and may minimize commitments related to the products and services we offer.\nInnovative Use Cases\nMany sectors, from traditional network operators to disruptive technology and data-driven companies, have found many innovative use cases for our platforms. Beyond simply enabling communications between people and devices, the Company\u2019s platforms are designed to enable any of the following, among others:\n\u2022Smart homes, including smart appliances, smart energy meters, wearables etc.\n\u2022Connected cars\n\u2022Smart cities\n\u2022Smart logistics and supply chains\n\u2022Smart healthcare applications\nIn addition to the foregoing, as a result of acquisitions completed in October 2018 and February 2019, the Company has acquired certain intellectual property portfolios (the \u201cAcquired IP Rights\u201d), which it now manages through various wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Company utilizes patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere to protect the Acquired IP Rights.\nBusiness Model\nAt Pareteum, our mission is to \u201cEmpower Communications Service Providers (\u201cCSPs\u201d), Enterprises and Developers to simply create and control their own wireless communications products and experience through our powerful combination of software, services and global connectivity.\u201d We believe that open software and interfaces for communications services will create more innovation, economic freedom, and opportunity equality worldwide, just like the internet did for information. Our value proposition intersects with numerous applications and industries. It is our strong belief that no other company in the CPaaS market offers similarly broad value in such a comprehensive way.\nHowever, an easily accessible open mobility system for the world is challenging to scale because it requires a \u201cnetwork effect.\u201d The network effect is the principle that a service yields increased value as it grows. The essence of this point is that our business and our services will grow in value as we grow and scale. We aim to achieve that growth by providing the marketplace exchange on which these communications and transactions take place, and in doing so we attract new users and more customers.\nTo achieve our desired growth, we use our managed services solutions as a launching pad from which to grow our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform by offering mobility, engagement, intelligence and control products and services to our existing and prospective customers. This process is already well underway, including with our anchor customer Vodafone.\nGo-to-Market and Growth Strategy\nPareteum is in growth mode, which we expect to achieve through a combination of organic growth as well as targeted mergers and acquisitions, such as the 2018 and 2019 Artilium, iPass and Devicescape acquisitions.\nPareteum seeks to continue winning new long-term contractual business. We expect this pace to increase throughout 2021 and beyond. Our focus is on selling and implementing new communications services and IoT opportunities as fast as reasonably possible, as the world of connected devices and people continues to rise on a daily basis.\nOur go-to-market strategy uses a four-phase approach:\nPhase 1: Continue to attract new subscribers across all verticals to all our platforms through direct sales, existing channel partnerships and new initiatives such as referral programs.\nPhase 2: Continue to on-board new communications services providers, multiplying our own growth, largely through business development and direct sales in each of our six defined sales regions (North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific).\nPhase 3: Drive adoption through a twin approach. First, we will be on-boarding more \u201cthings\u201d (whether Subscriber Identification Module (\u201cSIM\u201d) cards, handsets, devices, vehicles etc.) to our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform, as our initial user base. Second, we will be drawing in new and existing customers and end-users to add and consume more services into our existing Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. These will be people with the greatest pain point, who are underserved by the current mobility networks and applications out in the market (including in developing markets).\nPhase 4: At this stage, our strategic Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform customers will have their own go-to-market strategy, creating shared value, ranging from traditional consumer strategies to sophisticated B2B and B2B2C strategies, driving and expanding our ecosystem to new heights.\nThe phases described above are already being implemented, in parallel as far as possible, for the fastest, most sustainable growth, highlighting our strategy for accelerating the world\u2019s shift to an open mobility and application network. When we\u2019re successful, we believe it may accelerate the pace of innovation in the world, create more economic freedom, and provide better mobility services to billions of underserved people.\nWe also follow an organic growth plan focused on three core areas:\n\u2022Exploring cross-sale and up-sale opportunities among Pareteum\u2019s recent customer acquisitions - focused on offering new products and services that complement or supplement their existing or future needs so to accelerate their strategy;\n\u2022Platform evolution - enhance and expand existing products and services; and\n\u2022Geographic expansion-focusing on entering new markets, such as South East Asia and Latin America.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had 200 total employees worldwide, of which 199 were full-time employees.\nResearch & Development\nPareteum\u2019s research and development function attempts to ensure that its communications platforms grow in line with customer needs and technological advancement, and remain resilient, reliable and secure. Product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $10.3 million and $13.0 million, respectively.\nIntellectual Property\nPareteum relies on a combination of patents, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. The Company protects its brand and reputation through the exploitation of a number of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks. Pareteum has a patent portfolio of over 70 granted patents. The current patent portfolio includes, but is not limited to, a set of developments embracing areas such as advanced network characterization and migration, automated configuration for network appliances, method and system for changing security information in a computer network, method and system for verifying and updating the configuration of an access device during authentication, service quality monitoring process, system and method for enabling wireless social networking, and system and method for network curation, all expiring through 2034, and subject to renewals.\nPareteum further protects its intellectual property rights by requiring all its employees and independent contractors involved in the development of intellectual property to assign those rights to the Company, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.\nSales and Marketing\nPareteum\u2019s sales and marketing teams work together to identify and establish relationships with prospective customers, acquire new ones and expand relationships with existing customers by encouraging their consumption of additional services and products existing in our Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform. Our marketing team generates leads through our website, online marketing campaigns, webinars, white papers, public relations and other outbound lead development efforts.\nWe engage with prospective and existing customers through an enterprise sales approach. Our sales executives directly engage C-Level executives and other senior business, product, and technical decision makers responsible for the end-user experience and financial results at their companies. Our sales executives work to educate these decision makers and their teams about the benefits of using the Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform to launch and scale robust communications experiences.\nCustomers\nOur customers are tier 1 communications service providers that provide telecommunications services to end-users, Fortune 1,000 companies, mobile virtual network enablers of all sizes, software developers, banks, financial and online payment services companies, global consulting companies, mobile marketing platforms, telecommunications applications, and many others.\nA customer advocate is assigned to each new contract, and a multi-step process of hand-off from sales to service is handled by this distinct team that is made up of experienced staff around the globe and supported by back office professionals throughout the U.S., United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.\nPareteum provides multiple levels of customer support, including 24/7 support, to ensure service levels and network reliability to meet the expectations and requirements of Pareteum\u2019s customers. We believe that customers that use the Pareteum Experience Cloud Platform value our network reliability and availability, responsive customer support, competitive pricing, and collaborative approach.\nThe Company has significant customers and the loss of these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2020, two significant customers each individually accounted for 21% and 20% of our revenue and for the year ended December 31, 2019, one customer accounted for 20% of our revenue.\nCompetition\nWe compete with telecommunications solution providers, cloud software and service providers, communications\u2019 platforms, and the in-house IT and network departments of communications companies as well as firms that provide IT services (including consulting, systems integration and managed services), software vendors that sell products for particular aspects of a total information system, software vendors that specialize in systems for particular communications services (such as Internet, land-line and mobile services, cable, satellite and service bureaus) and companies that offer software systems in combination with the sale of network equipment.\nWe believe that our ability to compete depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022the development of software products by others that are competitive with our products and services;\n\u2022the price at which others offer competitive software and services;\n\u2022the ability to make use of the networks of mobile network operators;\n\u2022the technological changes of telecommunication operators affecting our ability to run services over their networks;\n\u2022the ability of competitors to deliver projects at a level of quality that rivals our own;\n\u2022the responsiveness of our competitors to customer needs; and\n\u2022the ability of our competitors to hire, retain and motivate key personnel.\nA number of our competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, substantial financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources, and strong name recognition. Current and potential competitors have established, and may establish in the future, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties.\nThe CPaaS market is moving quickly. We believe that the key competitive differentiators for Pareteum in the near-term will be:\n\u2022Scale and international reach of connectivity;\n\u2022Comprehensiveness of platform offerings;\n\u2022Ease of deployment and implementation; and\n\u2022Scalability and reliability of service.\nPareteum considers itself well-placed to be judged on those criteria. The Company is confident that its network of global and international connectivity partners will enable it to access markets that currently are under-served and compete equally with larger competitors in mature markets. In addition, Pareteum is confident that few other players have the breadth of value-added services to complement the core connectivity platforms, resulting in competitive positioning for each of the areas where it competes:\n\u2022MVNE services for CSPs: In a fragmented market without large competitors, Pareteum is well-known in the industry for a wide range of platform functionalities and high-flexibility to adapt to customer needs and accommodate complex requirements at a competitive price. As a result, Pareteum is serving leading CSPs in Europe, Asia Pacific, North America, Latin American and Africa, untapping solid growth potential in each of these markets.\n\u2022Wi-Fi connectivity aggregation for enterprise customers: Pareteum has built an extensive Wi-Fi footprint with exclusive deals, covering more hotels, airports, business, leisure and outdoor areas. Pareteum offers a unified user experience with seamless access across Wi-Fi hotspots to blue chip customers, with a variety of successful business models.\n\u2022Short Message Service Application-To-Person (\u201cSMS A2P\u201d) messaging for Enterprise customers: Leveraging global connectivity agreements enabling competitive price points and a strong competitive position in Europe, Pareteum offers fully programmable business-to-consumer messaging across a wide range of mobile and social channels with simple Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) integration.\n\u2022IoT connectivity platform for IoT solution providers: Leveraging on the above capabilities, Pareteum is in an advantageous position to build a unique proposition for IoT solution providers that would benefit from the large growth potential in IoT. The foundations are in place and Pareteum has already received very positive commercial traction.\nNevertheless, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources, as well as greater brand and market awareness, and consequently may be able to react more quickly to competitive pressures. As we execute on our growth strategies, and enter new markets, or disrupt markets and replace incumbents, we expect competition to become more intense.\nOne key tenet in our competitive strategy, however, is to actually lower the competitive barriers to market for new customers to create new mobility and communications applications and businesses. We intend to disrupt existing markets and have the advantage of quick time-to-market for those newly enabled business models and opportunities. These include, for example:\n\u2022Uniquely tailored data services such as unlimited social media, messaging apps or streaming music services.\n\u2022Global roaming connectivity without local infrastructure: e.g., business executives using a multi-SIM worldwide phone.\n\u2022Creation of personal, branded, mobile services.\n\u2022One-stop shop for bundles of IoT and machine-to-machine (\u201cM2M\u201d) services: through plug-ins to multiple vertical applications and specialized platforms. One-stop shop for current and next-gen Global System for Mobile (\u201cGSM\u201d) communications and Wi-Fi connectivity, deployed seamlessly through our CPaaS solutions.\nRegulatory\nPareteum is subject to several U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, telecommunications, trade and export sanctions or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and may be tested or varied in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving markets in which we operate. Because applicable international laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we, our products or our platform may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation.\nPrivacy and Data Protection\nThe regulatory framework for privacy, data protection and security issues worldwide is complex and rapidly evolving and as a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. These data privacy laws and regulations are especially relevant and applicable to us as a technology company because we process vast amounts of personal and non-personal data on behalf of our customers and we also host significant and increasing amounts of data in our cloud solutions. The application of existing laws to cloud-based solutions is particularly uncertain and cloud-based solutions may be subject to further regulation, the impact of which cannot be fully understood at this time. Moreover, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data processing and privacy practices. Complying with these various laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nBecause the interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws along with contractually imposed industry standards are uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, other claims and penalties, significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our services and platform capabilities and/or implement additional organizational and technical measures, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAny failure by us, our suppliers or other parties with whom we do business to comply with our contractual commitments or policies or with federal, state, local or international regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental, regulatory and supervisory authorities or others. In many jurisdictions (especially the European Union (\"EU\")), enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. In the U.S., these include enforcement actions in response to rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies, state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies. In addition, security advocates and industry groups have regularly proposed, and may propose in the future, self-regulatory standards with which we must legally comply or that contractually apply to us. If we fail to follow these security standards even if no personal information is compromised, we may incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in costs.\nInternationally, most jurisdictions in which we operate have established or strengthened their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we and our customers must comply, including but not limited to the EU, the U.K. and Switzerland. The EU and U.K. data protection landscape changed significantly in 2018, resulting in significant operational costs for internal compliance and risk to our business. The EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which went into effect in May 2018, and together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU, U.K. and Switzerland, ushered in a new and complex data protection regime including principles, rights and obligations with extraterritorial reach of the EU, U.K. and Swiss data protection authorities. The European data protection and security laws, including GDPR, provide for extensive data subject rights, robust obligations on data controllers and processors and additional requirements on businesses to put in place data protection and security compliance programs, systems and processes. Continued evolvement of, and varied implementation and interpretation of such European data protection and security laws has increased, and continues to extend, our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet these requirements and our obligations under such laws. Among other requirements, the GDPR (and its U.K. equivalent commonly referred to as the \u201cU.K. GDPR\u201d) regulates transfers of personal data (subject to such laws) from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) and the U.K. to the U.S. as well as other countries outside the EEA and the U.K. which are deemed not to provide adequate standards of data protection to the levels required by GDPR. The recent European Court of Justice judgement in July 2020 which nullified the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, its critical remarks about lack of data protection safeguards for non-US nationals, and subsequent and consequent measures taken by European data protection regulators in response to this judgement, has increased uncertainty in respect of data transfers from the EEA, U.K. and Switzerland to the U.S., creating serious challenges, uncertainties and increased costs for businesses such as ours. The GDPR and U.K. GDPR also impose numerous privacy-related obligations and requirements for companies operating in the EU and the U.K. including requiring data controllers not to transfer personal data to U.S.-based processors unless they agree to certain legally binding processing obligations, greater control for data subjects (for example, the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d), increased data portability for EU and U.K. consumers, data breach notification requirements and exposure to substantial fines for non-compliance. Under the GDPR and U.K. GDPR, fines of up to 20 million euros or 4% of the annual global revenue of the non-compliant company, whichever is greater, could be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR\u2019s and U.K. GDPR\u2019s requirements. Such penalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by customers and data subjects. The frequency and quantum of fines imposed by EU and U.K. data protection regulators under GDPR and U.K. GDPR has been increasing since 2019. The GDPR and U.K. GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries and affiliates, including employee personal data.\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. ceased to be a member of the EU, an event generally referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d. Following the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020, the U.K. left the EU Single Market and Customs Union, and is no longer subject to EU law or a party to the EU\u2019s trade agreements. Effective from January 1, 2021, the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between the U.K. and the EU, as it existed before December 31, 2020, ended and the EU and the U.K. now form two separate markets; two distinct regulatory and legal spaces. This will create barriers to trade in goods, services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges (including data) that did not exist prior to December 31, 2020.\nEven though the U.K. reached an agreement with the EU on the terms of their future cooperation, as reflected in the EU-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement (\"TCA\") and related documents, and the U.K. government has sought to reproduce the effects of the EU trading agreements and EU laws (including the implementation of U.K. GDPR) that previously applied to it, material changes took effect from January 1, 2021. It is unclear how the TCA will actually be implemented, how it will affect the nature of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the EU and how it will impact our business. It is also unclear how the U.K.\u2019s new arrangements with other countries will actually be implemented and the coverage of those agreements. The effects of this uncertainty will continue to impact the political and economic environment in the U.K. and across other EU member states, and may impair our ability to transact business. This uncertainty could also continue to affect the U.K., the EU and worldwide economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global financial markets, and the value of the pound sterling or other currencies, including the Euro.\nAdditionally, now that the U.K. and EU regulatory and legal spaces are distinct and separate, the regulatory frameworks of the U.K. and the EU may subsequently change and potentially divergent laws and regulations may develop, including those relating to data protection and security. This may have adverse practical and/or operational implications for our business that involves data processing and cross-border data transfers, including the potential disruption to data transfers, additional compliance and operational costs and necessary operational changes.\nAlthough the current arrangements between the EU and U.K. permit flow of data between these two regions for a period of up to 6 months from January 1, 2021, the European Commission has not yet made any determination as to whether U.K. is a safe country for personal data transfer. Even if such finding is made, with the U.K. not required to follow EU laws, there is an increased risk of divergence in data protection and security laws (and related guidance) between the U.K. and the EU, with the possibility of EU restricting data flows to the U.K. and vice versa. This has the potential to cause disruption to data transfers and our operations and result in additional compliance and operational costs.\nNon-compliance with relevant data privacy laws, directives and regulations, such as the GDPR and U.K. GDPR, could result in proceedings against us by governmental regulatory and supervisory authorities, customers, suppliers, data subjects and others. We may also experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new European or multi-national customers due to the legal requirements, concerns about U.S. data protection safeguards for non-U.S. nationals, compliance cost, potential risk exposure and uncertainty for these entities and businesses, and we may experience significantly increased liability with respect to these customers pursuant to the terms set forth in our engagements with them.\nU.S. federal and state laws in this area are also complex and developing rapidly. Many state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security. In addition, laws in all 50 states require businesses to provide notice to customers whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. The laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly. States are also constantly amending existing laws, requiring attention to frequently changing regulatory requirements. Further, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and imposes obligations on companies that process personal information of California residents. The CCPA was amended prior to going into effect, and it is possible that further amendments will be enacted, but even in its current form it remains unclear how various provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted and enforced. Among other things, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nTelecommunications Regulations\nCurrently, few existing laws or regulations specifically apply to the Internet, other than laws generally applicable to businesses. Many Internet-related laws and regulations, however, are pending and may be adopted in the U.S., in individual states and local jurisdictions and in other countries. These laws may relate to many areas that impact our business, including encryption, network and information security, and the convergence of traditional communication services, such as telephone services, with Internet communications, taxes and wireless networks. These types of regulations could differ between countries and other political and geographic divisions both inside and outside the U.S. Non-U.S. countries and political organizations may impose, or favor, more and different regulation than that which has been proposed in the U.S., thus furthering the complexity of regulation. Certain countries have implemented, or may implement, legislative and technological actions that either do or can effectively regulate access to the Internet, including the ability of Internet Service Providers to limit access to specific websites or content. In addition, state and local governments within the U.S. may impose regulations in addition to, inconsistent with, or stricter than federal regulations. The adoption of such laws or regulations, and uncertainties associated with their validity, interpretation, applicability and enforcement, may affect the available distribution channels for, and the costs associated with, our products and services. The adoption of such laws and regulations may harm our business.\nCorporate Information\nPareteum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was originally formed in 2001 as Elephant Talk Communications Corp. as a result of a merger between Staruni Corporation (USA, 1962) and Elephant Talk Limited (Hong Kong, 1994).\nFollowing approval at the Company\u2019s 2016 annual stockholders\u2019 meeting, the Company was rebranded and formally renamed \u201cPareteum Corporation.\u201d Since November 12, 2020, prices for the Company\u2019s common stock have been quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc.\u2019s Pink Open Market under the symbol \"TEUM.\"\nPareteum currently has offices in the U.S., Spain, Indonesia, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and India and maintains a minor presence in other locations.\nPareteum\u00ae, the Pareteum logo, the strapline to \u201cConnect Every Person and Every(Thing)\u2122\u201d and other trademarks or service marks of Pareteum, as well as those trademarks or service marks of the Artilium and iPass group companies, which appear in this Annual Report are the property of Pareteum Corporation or its subsidiaries.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical consolidated financial statements, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed or implied by the forward-looking statements. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report and \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in the forepart of this Annual Report.\nBusiness Overview\nPareteum Corporation (OTC: TEUM) is a growth-oriented cloud software communications platform company with a mission - to Connect Every Person and Every(Thing)\u2122. Pareteum\u2019s goal is to unleash the power of applications and mobile services, bringing secure, ubiquitous, scalable, and seamlessly available voice, video, SMS/text messaging, and data services to its customers, making worldwide communications services easily and economically accessible to everyone.

The vast majority of our platform is comprised of our internally-developed software and intellectual property, which provides our customers with flexibility in how they use our products and allows us to be market driven going forward. We have been granted over 70 patents related to techniques and processes which support our cloud software and communications platform solutions. Our platform services partners (whose technologies are integrated into our cloud) include Hewlett Packard, IBM, Sonus, Oracle, Microsoft, NetNumber, Affirmed and other world-class technology providers.\nThe Pareteum cloud communications platform targets large and growing sectors from IoT, MVNO, Smart Cities, and application developer markets - each in need of mobile platforms, management and connectivity.

Our vision is to empower Communication Service Providers, Enterprises and Developers to simply create and control their own wireless communications products and experiences through our powerful combination of software, services and global connectivity.\nPareteum Corporation, a Delaware corporation, was originally formed in 2001 as Elephant Talk Communications Corp. as a result of a merger between Staruni Corporation (USA, 1962) and Elephant Talk Limited (Hong Kong, 1994). Since 2016, our name has been Pareteum Corporation, and from November 12, 2019 until November 12, 2020, our common stock was traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol \u201cTEUM.\u201d Prices for our common stock are now quoted on the Pink Sheets under the same symbol.\nRecent Developments\nAsset Disposition\nIn August 2020, the Company entered into an asset transfer agreement and a software license agreement with a data communications provider (the \"Purchaser\"), pursuant to which Purchaser agreed to purchase certain property and equipment and software licenses related to an MVNE solution for total cash consideration of $12.3 million. The Purchaser paid $4.7 million in August 2020 and the remainder in December 2020 upon the completion of the transfer to the Purchaser. The Company recorded a gain on sale of assets of $10.8 million for the difference between the consideration received and the book value of the property and equipment and the software license (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Disposition - Asset Disposition).\nDelisting of the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nOn November 5, 2020, the Company notified the Nasdaq Hearings Panel that it would not be able to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2019, its amended Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2018, its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 or its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 by November 9, 2020, the date by which the Nasdaq Hearings Panel had required the Company to make such filings in order for the Company\u2019s common stock to remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn response to the Company\u2019s notice to the Nasdaq Stock Market that it would not satisfy the conditions to the exception to the listing requirements granted by the Hearing Panel, the Nasdaq Stock Market notified the Company by letter dated November 10, 2020 that the Company\u2019s common stock would be delisted, and trading of the Company\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market was suspended effective at the open of business on November 12, 2020. Since the trading of the Company\u2019s common stock was suspended, prices for our common stock have been quoted on Pink Sheets. The formal delisting of the Company\u2019s common stock from the Nasdaq became effective on February 12, 2021.\nSenior Secured Convertible Note\nOn June 8, 2020, the Company issued an $17.5 million in principal amount of an 8% Senior Secured Convertible Note due April 1, 2025 (the \u201cHigh Trail Note\u201d) to High Trail Investments SA LLC for $14.0 million. On June 8, 2020, the Company received $4.0 million. The remaining $10.0 million balance was deposited into a blocked bank account that will be released to the Company upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The Company is currently default under the High Trail Note, and High Trail has caused $6.0 million of the purchase price maintained in such blocked account to be transferred to High Trail in partial satisfaction of the amounts outstanding under the High Trail Note. (see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Senior Secured Convertible Note)\nSeries C Redeemable Preferred Stock\nOn various dates from February 21, 2020 through August 18, 2020, the Company issued shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock and on various dates from July 17, 2020 through October 1, 2020, the Company entered into agreements with those holders that allow either the Company or the holders to exchange outstanding shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Such exchanges are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including approval of the Company\u2019s stockholders of the issuance of such common stock and the Company\u2019s ability to issue shares of common stock not subject to restrictions on resale. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon exchange of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock under the Series C Exchange Agreements will determined by the application of a formula in which (i) the stated value of the shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock being converted plus the value of any accrued and unpaid dividends plus, with respect to certain agreed upon shares of the Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock, a premium of 12.5% on the stated value is divided by (ii) the conversion price. The conversion price for certain holders of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock in the aggregate is $0.70, while the conversion price for certain other holders of shares of Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock is the lower of (i) $0.60 and (ii) the greater of (x) the average daily volume-weighted average price per share of Common Stock during the five trading days before the closing of the exchange and (y) $0.40. (see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock).\nSenior Secured Second Lien Notes\nAs previously disclosed and discussed below under the heading \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d during the first quarter of 2021, the Company issued Senior Second Lien Secured Convertible Notes due 2025 in the aggregate principal amount of $1.79 million.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily through providing CPaaS solutions to enterprises, communications service providers, early-stage innovators, developers, IoT, and telecommunications infrastructure providers.

Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis to depreciation and amortization. When assigning useful lives to internal-use software, the Company considers the effects of obsolescence, competition, technology, and other economic factors.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net is comprised of interest expense accrued or paid on our indebtedness and the amortization of debt discount and deferred financing costs, net of interest income earned on cash balances.\nGain on sale of assets\nGain on sale of assets consists of the gain recorded for the sale of certain assets, the transfer of which was completed in December 2020, measured as the difference between the consideration received and the book value of the property and equipment and the software licenses (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Disposition - Asset Disposition).\nChange in fair value of derivative and warrant liabilities\nChange in fair value of embedded derivatives and warrant liabilities consist of the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and warrant liabilities related to the Company's Senior Secured Convertible Note issued in June 2020 (see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Senior Secured Convertible Note - Derivative liability / Warrant liability).\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt during 2020 consists of the loss recognized as a result of the modification of certain provisions of the Series C redeemable preferred stock that was accounted for as an extinguishment (see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Series C redeemable preferred stock).

The conversion of Euros and USD leads to period-to-period fluctuations in our reported USD results arising from changes in the exchange rate between the USD and the Euro. Generally, when the USD strengthens relative to the Euro, it has an unfavorable impact on our reported revenue and income and a favorable impact on our reported expenses. Conversely, when the USD weakens relative to the Euro, it produces a favorable impact on our reported revenue and income, and an unfavorable impact on our reported expenses. These fluctuations in the USD/Euro exchange rate therefore result in currency translation effects (not to be confused with real currency exchange effects), which impact our reported USD results and may make it difficult to determine actual increases and decreases in our revenue and expenses that are attributable to our actual operating activities. We carry out our business activities primarily in Euros, and we do not currently engage in hedging activities.\nThe following table shows the average USD equivalent of the major currencies used to translate our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nUSD\nEquivalent\nEuro $ 1.13958 $ 1.14460\nBritish Pound $ 1.28235 $ 1.27369\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $69.6 million, an increase of $7.6 million, or 12.2%, compared to $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to strong demand for services in our mobility business, partially offset by a decrease in connectivity services, which includes travel-related communications. We attribute the net increase in demand to the overall impact that the COVID-related restrictions have had on demand for our various services, especially for messaging and consumer mobile services.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $49.0 million, an increase of $1.8 million, or 3.9%, compared to $47.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue and, to a lesser extent, an unfavorable service mix.\nProduct Development\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company capitalized $6.5 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of internal-use software.\nProduct development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $10.3 million and $13.0 million, respectively, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 20.2%. This decrease was mainly due to a decline in personnel and related costs in 2020 in part due to restraints on the Company's access to capital.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $6.1 million and $10.3 million, respectively, a decrease of $4.2 million, or 40.6%. Sales and marketing expenses declined mainly due to a decrease in personnel and related costs and a reduction in sales costs due to COVID-related restrictions.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $29.8 million and $34.6 million, respectively, a decrease of $4.8 million, or 13.8%. This decrease is primarily due to an absence in 2020 of iPass acquisition-related costs and reduction in 2020 of personnel costs, partially offset by an increase in costs associated with the restatement of the Company's historical financial statements.\nAcquisition Costs\nThere were no acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2020. The acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $3.5 million related to our acquisition of iPass.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets\nThere was no impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $156.8 million, consisting of a $125.9 million impairment of goodwill and a $30.8 million impairment of intangible assets (see Note 4, Goodwill and Intangible Assets)\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $10.8 million and $12.7 million, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 15.3%. The decrease is primarily due to the impairment of finite-lived intangible assets in 2019.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $9.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively, an increase of $6.5 million due to increases in borrowings and the Company's effective borrowing rate, including borrowings under the High Trail Note and the Senior Second Lien Note.\nGain on sale of assets\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a $10.8 million gain on the sale of certain assets, the transfer of which was completed in December 2020 (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Disposition - Asset Disposition).\nChange in fair value of derivative and warrant liabilities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized, in aggregate, a favorable $7.0 million change in fair value based on the fair value changes of embedded derivatives and warrant liability related to the Company's Senior Secured Convertible Note issued in June 2020 and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock (see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Senior Secured Convertible Note - Derivative liability / Warrant liability and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Derivative liability / Warrant liability).\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $17.0 million related to the modification of certain provisions of the Series C redeemable preferred stock that was accounted for as an extinguishment (see Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Series C redeemable preferred stock). For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8.9 million related to the extinguishment of debt previously outstanding under that certain Fortress Credit Agreement, under which we had borrowed funds from Fortress Credit Corp., and under that certain credit agreement with Post Road Special Opportunity Fund I LLP in February 2019 and September 2019 (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Disposition - iPass, Inc. Acquisition and Note 5, Debt and Series C Redeemable Preferred Stock - Former Post Road Group Debt Facility).\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense) net, is generated from non-operating activities and includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded other income, net of $0.1 million compared to other expense, net of $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The favorable change of $3.3 million was primarily due to a reserve recorded in 2019 on a note receivable and the favorable impact in 2020 for the forgiveness of a Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\") loan in the amount of $0.6 million on our results in 2020 as compared to 2019.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nIncome tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0.1 million and $8.3 million, respectively. This change was primarily due to the full valuation of the deferred tax liability from the Artilium acquisition, which was a discrete item in 2019.\nAccretion and dividends of series C redeemable preferred stock\nAccretion and dividends of series C redeemable preferred stock for the years ended December 31, 2020 was $0.8 million. There were no amounts recorded to accretion and dividends of series C redeemable preferred stock in 2019 since the modification and classification to temporary equity of the series C redeemable preferred stock occurred during 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had accumulated deficits of $584.6 million and $539.5 million and reported net losses of $44.7 million and $222.3 million as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $156.8 million, consisting of a $125.9 million impairment of goodwill and a $30.8 million intangible assets impairment.\nThe Company's cash balance, including restricted cash, was $14.8 million and $5.9 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOn June 8, 2020, we issued the High Trail Note with a principal amount of $17.5 million to High Trail Investments SA LLC (\u201cHigh Trail\u201d) due April 1, 2025 for an aggregate purchase price of $14.0 million, of which $6.0 million was previously maintained in one or more blocked accounts. The terms of the High Trail Note require the Company to meet certain specified conditions and covenants, some of which have not been satisfied by the dates required, including (i) the Company filing its restated financial statements with the SEC for (a) the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, (b) the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and (c) the quarter ended June 30, 2019, in each case on or prior to October 31, 2020, (ii) after October 31, 2020, the Company timely filing its subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and its subsequent annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC in the manner and within the time periods required under the Exchange Act, and (iii) the Company maintaining the listing of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result, we have been in default under the terms of the High Trail Note since October 31, 2020 and at High Trail\u2019s option, High Trail can demand payment for the outstanding principal amount. In addition, the interest rate increased to 18% per annum. On April 8, 2021, High Trail provided notice to the Company that it was causing $6.0 million of the purchase price maintained in such blocked account to be transferred to High Trail in partial satisfaction of the amounts outstanding under the High Trail Note.\nOn November 30, 2020, we entered into a Forbearance Agreement (the \u201cForbearance Agreement\u201d) with High Trail. Under the terms of the Forbearance Agreement, High Trail agreed to forebear from exercising certain rights and remedies. High Trail agreed that it would not, directly or indirectly, exercise any right or remedy under any transaction document or take any other enforcement action in respect of the occurrence and continuance of any existing events of default, or encourage any other person to take or initiate any such enforcement action or other action through the forbearance termination date as defined as: (a) December 31, 2020 (or any later date agreed to in writing by High Trail; (b) the occurrence of any event of default (other than an existing event of default); and (c) the initiation of any action by the Company or any other person to invalidate or limit the enforceability of any of the acknowledgments set forth in the Forbearance Agreement. Subsequently, High Trail agreed to extend the forbearance termination date to March 31, 2021. The forbearance period under the Forbearance Agreement has not been subsequently extended.\nOn May 24, 2020, the Company entered into a new forbearance agreement (the \u201cNew Forbearance Agreement\u201d) with High Trail under which (i) the Company again admitted it was in default under several obligations under the High Trail Note and related agreements, (ii) High Trail acknowledged such defaults and agreed not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note or the related securities purchase agreement, warrant or security documents, including its right to accelerate the aggregate amount outstanding under the High Trail Note, until the earlier of May 31, 2020 or any later date to which such date may be extended (the \u201cOutside Date\u201d), and the date of any new event of default or initiation of any action by the Company to invalidate any of the representations and warranties made in the New Forbearance Agreement. The Outside Date automatically extends for successive two-week periods unless on or before the then-applicable Outside Date the lender provides notice that the Outside Date is not being extended.\nAs partial consideration for its agreement not to exercise any right or remedy under the High Trail Note and related documents, High Trail and the Company agreed to make certain changes to the documents. In this regard, the parties agreed to amend the \u201cEvent of Default Acceleration Amount\u201d definition in the High Trail Note so that the amount due and payable by the Company on account of an event of default would be an amount in cash equal to 125% of the then-outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the High Trail Note. This represents an increase from 120% of the then-outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest, and removes the market-price-based alternative for such acceleration amount.\nAdditionally, the parties also agreed that the principal amount outstanding under the High Trail Note would be increased by certain paid-in-kind amounts in full satisfaction of the Company\u2019s obligation to make payments of interest to High Trail on each of April 1, 2021 and May 1, 2021, which amounts were not paid by the Company in cash or Common Stock. In consideration of High Trail\u2019s agreement to enter into the New Forbearance Agreement and agree to the amendments to the High Trail Note, the Company agreed to pay High Trail a fee in the amount of $1.5 million. Accordingly, following these increases in the principal amount payable, but applying against the outstanding principal and such fee the $6.0 million previously\nmaintained in a certain blocked account against that was foreclosed upon by High Trail, the total amount of principal outstanding under the High Trail Note as of the date of the New Forbearance Agreement was approximately $13.5 million.\nOn February 22, 2021, we issued a $2.4 million 8% Senior Second Lien Secured Convertible Note due 2025 (the \u201cSenior Second Lien Note\u201d) to an institutional investor and received $2.0 million. The aggregate purchase price for the Senior Second Lien Note was $2.0 million. The Senior Second Lien Notes are senior, secured obligations of the Company, but rank junior to the High Trail Note. Interest is payable monthly beginning April 1, 2021 The Senior Second Lien Note is secured by a second lien on substantially all assets of the Company and substantially all assets of its material U.S.-organized subsidiaries.\nOn April 29, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with two initial investors and other investors as may become party thereto from time to time (collectively, the \u201cSecond Lien Note Purchasers\u201d) providing for the issuance and sale by the Company of up to $6.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Second Lien Secured Convertible Notes due 2025 (the \u201cNotes\u201d) and warrants to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock (the \u201cApril 2021 Warrants\u201d) to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of our common stock. The Senior Second Lien Notes and accompanying April 2021 Warrants may be sold from time to time to one or more Second Lien Note Purchasers under the terms of the purchase agreement. On April 29, 2021, we closed on the sale of Senior Second Lien Notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.79 million and April 2021 Warrants to purchase 1,490,000 shares of common stock under the purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of $1.49 million.\nBecause of the limited nature of the relief provided under the Forbearance Agreement, which does not lower the amounts payable in principal or interest, the limited amount of additional capital we have raised and can raise by selling the Senior Second Lien Notes and the foreclosure by High Trail on $6.0 million of the High Trail Note purchase price, we believe that we will not have sufficient resources to fund our operations and meet the obligations specified in the Senior Second Lien Note and any obligations under the High Trail Note for the next twelve months following the filing of this Annual Report. Our software platforms require ongoing funding to continue the current development and operational plans and we have a history of net losses. We will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future in connection with the continued development of our software platforms. These expenditures include costs associated with research and development activity, corporate administration, business development, and marketing and selling of our services. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise.\nAs a result, we believe that additional capital will be required to fund our operations and provide growth capital to meet the obligations under the High Trail Note and the Senior Second Lien Notes. Accordingly, we will have to raise additional capital in one or more debt and/or equity offerings and continue to work with High Trail to enter into a new forbearance arrangement or agree to restructure the indebtedness owed to High Trail. Accordingly, our management has been actively exploring these and other options for addressing our liquidity issues. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising the necessary capital or that any such offering will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that High Trail will agree to forbear or restructure our indebtedness. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed, this would have a material adverse effect on the Company. In particular, a decline in the market price of our common stock, coupled with the stock\u2019s delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market, could make it more difficult to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued.\nOperating Activities\nWe reported net cash used in operating activities of $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $17.8 million in 2019, an increase in cash used of $0.7 million. Net cash used in operating activities increased primarily as a result of the timing of payments to fund operations.\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019\nNet loss $ (44,661) $ (222,347)\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities: 22,534 188,194\n(22,127) (34,153)\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities: 3,686 16,392\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (18,441) $ (17,761)\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $4.3 million, an increase of $15.4 million or 139%, compared to $11.1 million net cash used in investing activities in 2019. This increase in cash provided during 2020 as compared to 2019 was primarily the result of proceeds received during 2020 for the sale of assets.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $23.3 million, compared to $28.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased as a result of a reduction in net cash proceeds during 2020 from the issuance of loans and redeemable preferred stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPurchase Commitment\nDuring 2019, the Company entered into certain off-balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (\u201cunconditional purchase obligations\u201d) (see Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies).\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nRevenue Recognition and Net billings in Excess of Revenue\nRevenue represents amounts earned for (non-software) arrangements consisting of hosting subscriptions for our CPaaS solutions. We also offer customer support and professional services related to implementing and supporting our suite of applications. Revenue is generally recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nMonthly Service Revenue:\nThe Company\u2019s performance obligations in monthly Software as a Service (SaaS) and service offerings are simultaneously received and consumed by the customer and therefore are recognized over time. For recognition purposes, we do not unbundle such services into separate performance obligations. The Company typically bills its customer at the end of each month, with payment to be received shortly thereafter. The fees charged may include a combination of fixed and variable charges with the variable charges tied to the number of subscribers or some other measure of volume. Although the consideration may be variable, the volumes are estimable at the time of billing, with \u201ctrue-up\u201d adjustments occurring in the subsequent month. Such amounts have not been historically significant.\nInstallation and Software Development Revenue:\nThe Company\u2019s other revenue consist generally of installation and software development projects.\nInstallation represents the activities necessary for a customer to obtain access and connectivity to the Company\u2019s monthly SaaS and service offerings. While installation may require separate phases, it represents one promise within the context of the contract.\nSoftware development consists of programming and other services which adds new functionality to a customer\u2019s existing or new service offerings. Each development project defines its milestones and will have its own performance obligation.\nRevenue is recognized over time if the installation and software development activities create an asset that has no alternative use for which the Company is entitled to receive payment for performance completed to date. If not, then revenue is not recognized until the applicable performance obligation is satisfied.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations:\nThe Company\u2019s contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The Company generally determines standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nContract assets and liabilities:\nGiven the nature of the Company\u2019s services and contracts, it has no contract assets. The Company records net billings in excess of revenue when payments are made in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable.\nPayment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, payment is required before control is transferred or services are delivered to the customer.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe record an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts in an amount approximating anticipated losses. Accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers. An allowance is recorded on the basis of loss experience, known and inherent risk in the account balance and current economic conditions. Individual uncollectible accounts are written off against the allowance when collection of the individual accounts appears doubtful.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate our income taxes separately for each tax jurisdiction in which we conduct operations. The provision for federal, state, foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In determining the net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances, we are required to make judgments and estimates in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. If we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes.\nShare-based Compensation\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, (\u201cASC 718\u201d). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, directors and non-employees to be recognized in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss by measuring the fair value of the award on the date of grant and recognizing this fair value as expense using a straight-line method over the requisite service period, generally the vesting period. The Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and, if necessary, revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nThe Company estimates the grant date fair value of stock-based payments that vest over time using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates that impact the valuation of stock-based payments.\nWarrant and Embedded Derivative Liabilities\nWarrant and embedded derivative liabilities are remeasured at fair value each reporting period in accordance with the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. The Company utilizes the Monte Carlo valuation model to determine the value of the outstanding warrants and the conversion feature in the convertible notes. Since the Monte Carlo valuation model requires special software and expertise to model the assumptions to be used, the Company uses a third-party valuation expert to fair value these liabilities.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition, under the acquisition method of accounting. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, liabilities related to uncertain tax positions, and contingencies. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one-year measurement period to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair value of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could materially change our operating income and net income and result in different asset values on our balance sheet.\nSignificant estimates and assumptions that we must make in estimating the fair value of acquired technology, customer lists, and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment. We operate in one reportable segment.\nWe test for an indication of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, or sooner, when indicators of impairment exist, by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If there is an indication of impairment, we perform a \u201cstep two\u201d test to measure the impairment. Impairments, if any, are recorded to the statement of operations in the period the impairment is recognized.\nA significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators include a sustained and significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate and unanticipated competition.\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (\u201cASC 360\u201d), finite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, between three and ten years. Finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the amount of the carrying value that exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nContingent Losses\nFrom time to time, during the normal course of operations, we are party to litigation and regulatory matters, claims and other contingent matters. Litigation and regulatory reviews can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex proceedings and reviews are difficult to predict and our view of these matters may change in the future as events related thereto unfold. We expense legal fees as incurred. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount or range of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal or regulatory matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\nImpact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements.",

There are no family relationships between or among any director, executive officer or person nominated or chosen by the Company to become a director or executive officer.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nBoard Committees\nOur Board has established four standing committees: (1) Audit and Finance, (2) Nominating and Corporate Governance, (3) Compensation and (4) Business and Strategy. All of the standing committees operate under a charter that has been approved by the Board of Directors and that is, other than the charter of the Business and Strategy Committee, available on our website, www.Pareteum.com. These charters were all each revised and updated during 2020 to reflect what the Board believes are current best practices for a Company of our size and market capitalization.\nAudit and Finance Committee\nThe Audit Committee is composed of Mr. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on (member since March 1, 2017), Mr. Lippert (Chairman since November 16, 2018) and Ms. Vitale (member since November 1, 2019).

Each of the then-members of the Audit Committee was present at 75% or more of the meetings of the Audit Committee held in 2020.\nThe Audit Committee oversees our corporate accounting, financial reporting practices and the audits of financial statements. For this purpose, the Audit and Committee has a charter (which is reviewed annually) and performs several functions. The Audit Committee:\n\u2022evaluates the independence and performance of, and assesses the qualifications of, our independent auditor, and engages such independent auditor;\n\u2022approves the plan and fees for the annual audit, quarterly reviews, tax and other audit-related services, and approves in advance any non-audit service to be provided by the independent auditor;\n\u2022reviews and approves related-party transactions;\n\u2022monitors the independence of the independent auditor and the rotation of partners of the independent auditor on our engagement team as required by law;\n\u2022reviews the financial statements to be included in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and reviews with management and the independent auditors the results of the annual audit and reviews of our quarterly financial statements;\n\u2022oversees all aspects our systems of internal accounting control and corporate governance functions on behalf of the Board of Directors; and\n\u2022provides oversight assistance in connection with legal, ethical and risk management compliance programs established by management and the Board of Directors, including Sarbanes-Oxley implementation, and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding corporate governance issues and policy decisions.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nOur Board of Directors has a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the \u201cNominating Committee\u201d), which in 2020 was composed of Mr. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on (member since March 1, 2017), Mr. Lippert (member since November 16, 2018) and Mr. Yves van Sante (Chairman and Member since December 16, 2015). The Nominating Committee met two (2) times in 2020. Ms. Vitale became a member of the Nominating Committee on November 1, 2019, and she became Chair of the Nominating Committee on January 1, 2020 following the resignation of Mr. van Sante from the Nominating Committee on December 31, 2019.\nThe Nominating Committee is charged with the responsibility of reviewing our corporate governance policies and with presenting new potential director-nominees to the Board of Directors for consideration. The Nominating Committee has a charter which is reviewed annually. All members of the Nominating Committee are independent directors as defined by the rules of the Nasdaq. The Nominating Committee will consider director nominees recommended by stockholders. To recommend a nominee, please write to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, c/o the Company Secretary, Pareteum Corporation, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10036. The Nominating Committee will assess all director nominees using the same criteria it applies generally, described below under the heading \u201c - Director and Officer Qualifications.\u201d\nCompensation Committee\nOur Board of Directors also has a Compensation Committee (the \u201cCompensation Committee\u201d) composed of Mr. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on (Chairman; member since July 25, 2017), Mr. Lippert (member since November 16, 2018) and Ms. Vitale (member since November 1, 2019).

The Compensation Committee met five (5) times in 2020 and acted by unanimous written consent two (2) times in 2020.\nThe Compensation Committee has the authority to directly engage, at the Company\u2019s expense, any compensation consultants or other advisers as it deems necessary to carry out its responsibilities in determining the amount and form of employee, executive and director compensation. In 2020, the Compensation Committee did not engage any such compensation consultants or advisers.\nA stockholder may send communications regarding executive and director compensation to the Compensation Committee, c/o the Company Secretary, Pareteum Corporation, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10036.\nBusiness and Strategy Committee\nOur Board created the Business and Strategy Committee in November 2019 and elected Messrs. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on (Chairman), Mr. Lippert and Ms. Vitale to serve on the committee. The Business and Strategy Committee is responsible for overseeing, researching, and recommending strategic options relating to the Company\u2019s business, market positioning, corporate financing and mergers & acquisitions opportunities, market and commercial positioning, and other areas as determined by the Board. The Business and Strategy Committee met two (2) times in 2020. Our Board has engaged a third-party advisor regarding market opportunity and strategy.\nDirector and Officer Qualifications\nWe have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met by each of our officers or directors or specific qualities or skills that are necessary for one or more of our officers or members of the Board of Directors to possess. However, our Nominating Committee generally evaluates and recommends candidates with a focus on the following qualities: educational background, ethnic and gender diversity, breadth of professional experience, knowledge of our industry and business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom and ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders and other stakeholders.\nOur Board of Directors and officers are composed of a diverse group of leaders. In their prior positions they have gained experience in core management skills, such as strategic and financial planning, public company financial reporting, compliance, risk management, and leadership development. Most of our officers and directors also have experience serving on boards of directors and board committees of other public companies or private companies, and have an understanding of\ncorporate governance practices and trends, which provides an understanding of different business processes, challenges and strategies. We are also dedicated to maintaining and enhancing the knowledge and skills of our directors.\nThe following matrix summarizes our director nominees\u2019 individual experiences, skills and characteristics. This summary is not an exhaustive list of each nominee\u2019s contributions to the Board. However, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee utilized this matrix in determining the individuals selected for nomination.\nGender Public\nCompany\nReporting\nExperience M&A\nExperience Technology\nBusiness &\nIndustry\nExperience Legal\nExpertise Strategic\nExperience Cybersecurity\nExpertise\nMary Beth Vitale F \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\nLuis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on M \u221a \u221a \u221a \u221a\nRobert L. Lippert M \u221a \u221a \u221a\nRobert H. Turner M \u221a \u221a \u221a\nIndependence Standards for Directors\nThere are no arrangements between our directors and any other person pursuant to which our directors were nominated or elected for their positions.\nThree of our current directors, Luis Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Robert L. Lippert and Mary Beth Vitale are \u201cindependent\u201d under Nasdaq rules. All of the individuals nominated for election at the Meeting are \u201cindependent\u201d under Nasdaq rules. Each of Messrs. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on and Lippert and Ms. Vitale serve on the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating Committee and the Strategy and Business Committee. Our Interim Non-Executive Chair, Ms. Vitale, is independent.\nIn addition, Mr. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Mr. Lippert and Ms. Vitale qualify as \u201cindependent\u201d under the standards established by the SEC for members of audit committees. The Board of Directors has determined that Robert L. Lippert and Mary Beth Vitale is each an \u201caudit committee financial expert\u201d as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. Stockholders should understand that this designation is a disclosure requirement of the SEC related to these individuals\u2019 experience and understanding with respect to certain accounting and auditing matters. The designation does not impose upon Mr. Lippert or Ms. Vitale any duties, obligations or liability that are greater than those generally imposed on them as a member of the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors, and their designation as audit committee financial experts pursuant to this SEC requirement does not affect the duties, obligations, or liability of any other member of the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors also determined that Mr. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on, Mr. Lippert and Ms. Vitale have sufficient knowledge in reading and understanding financial statements to serve on the Audit Committee.\nBoard Leadership Structure and Executive Sessions\nThe positions of Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are currently held by different persons, although the Board does not have a policy on whether or not the roles of Chief Executive Officer and chairperson of the Board should be separate and, if they are to be separate, whether the chairperson should be selected from the non-employee directors or be an employee of the Company. Accordingly, our Board reserves the right to vest the responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer and Chair in the same person or in two different individuals depending on what it believes is in our best interest. At this time, our Board has determined that separation of these roles most appropriately suits us. The Board will, however, appoint a lead director if the Chair and Chief Executive Officer roles are in the future combined, to conduct executive sessions, and Chair the Board if the Chief Executive Officer is unavailable and for such other purposes as the board finds useful.\nThe Board\u2019s policy is to periodically hold executive sessions without the presence of management, including the Chief Executive Officer or other non-independent directors. In general, time is reserved during each regularly scheduled Board meeting should the outside directors wish to meet in private executive session. When the outside directors meet without a non-independent chairperson of the Board, the lead director shall chair the meeting. The outside directors may also meet at such other times as determined by the presiding director.\nRisk Oversight\nOur Business and Strategy Committee and our Audit Committee share responsibility for oversight of risk management, with members of management also playing a key role. Our Business and Strategy Committee is responsible for the oversight of the Company\u2019s overall enterprise risk management, risk profile and risk assessment, although it coordinates with other committees of the Board, and the full Board, as it from time to time deems appropriate. The Business and Strategy Committee also oversees risk in the areas of corporate strategy and corporate growth and development. Our Audit Committee also assists the full Board in overseeing, approving and monitoring the company-wide enterprise risks identified by various levels of management and the Board. These risks generally cover, but are not limited to: compliance, environmental, financial, operational, reputational, as well as digital risks (fraud, cybersecurity and network). Management is responsible for developing a plan to monitor, assign ownership and respond to early threats and for communicating the methods and processes to manage and leverage opportunities associated with each risk on a regular cadence with the Board. With respect to high-risk areas, we have directed management to present detailed mitigation activities to the Board on an annual basis.\nThe Audit Committee has also directed management to develop a risk management policy, which plan must be submitted and approved on an annual basis by such committee. The risk management plan is required to consider the maturity of the risk management of the Company, to be tailored to the specific circumstances of the Company, include the Company\u2019s risk management structure, the standards and methodology adopted, risk management guidelines, reference to integration and details of the assurance and review of the risk management process.\nEmployee, Officer and Director Hedging\nThe Company\u2019s Insider Trading Policy and our Corporate Governance Guidelines contain restrictions on the ability of directors, officers, and employees to engage in certain transactions that hedge or modify the effect of any transaction in Company securities. Specifically, our Corporate Governance Guidelines prohibit such persons from (i) selling the Company\u2019s securities short, (ii) buying or selling put or call options, or other derivative securities, with respect to the Company\u2019s securities, (iii) engaging in transactions that hedge or offset or that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of shares of the Company\u2019s stock (or the stock of any of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries) granted to such persons as compensation or otherwise held by such persons either directly or indirectly, including through the purchase of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds and (iv) holding any Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as collateral for any loan.\nAttendance at Board, Committee and Stockholder Meetings\nOur Board of Directors met in person and telephonically two (2) times during 2020 and acted by unanimous written consent two (2) times during 2020. Each of the then-members of our Board of Directors was present at 75% or more of the Board of Directors meetings held in 2020. In addition, there were two (2) additional formal meetings of the Independent Directors. The Independent Directors also met informally between themselves and/or with management at least once each week in 2020.\nWe have encouraged, but do not require, that all of our directors be in attendance at our annual shareholder meeting either in person or by remote communication. In 2020, the Company did not hold an annual stockholder meeting.\nStockholder Communications to the Board\nGenerally, stockholders who have questions, concerns, or wish to address questions regarding our business directly to the Board, or any individual director, should direct his or her questions in writing to Pareteum Corporation, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, 2nd Floor, New York, NY, 10036, attention: Secretary. The office of the Secretary will receive the correspondence and forward it to the director or directors to whom the communication is addressed. From time to time, the Board may change the process or means by which stockholders may communicate with the Board or its members. Please refer to our website, www.pareteum.com, for any changes in this process.\nItems that are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board may be excluded, such as:\n\u2022junk mail and mass mailings;\n\u2022resumes and other forms of job inquiries;\n\u2022surveys; and\n\u2022solicitations or advertisements.\nIn addition, any material that is unduly hostile, threatening, or illegal in nature may be excluded, provided that any communication that is filtered out will be made available to any independent director upon request.\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock (referred to herein as the \u201creporting persons\u201d) file with the SEC various reports disclosing their ownership of, and any transactions relating to, our common stock. Such reporting persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports filed on their behalf. Based solely upon a review of copies of Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed with the SEC on behalf of reporting persons and representations received by us from reporting persons, and without conducting any additional independent investigation of our own, we have determined that the following holdings and transactions of reporting persons were, due to administrative error, not timely reported:\nIn 2020, Form 4s reporting the following transactions were not timely filed: the cancellation on January 1, 2020 of stock options previously issued to Mr. Lippert; which was subsequently reported in a form 4 filed on December 31, 2020; the acquisition by Mr. Lippert of restricted stock granted on January 1, 2020, which was subsequently reported in a Form 4 filed on January 22, 2020; the acquisition by Mr. van Sante of stock options granted on January 3, 2020, which was subsequently reported in a Form 4 filed on January 22, 2020; the acquisition by Mr. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on of common stock on January 3, 2020, which was subsequently reported in a From 4 filed on June 12, 2020; the acquisition by each of Ms. Vitale and Mr. van Sante of stock options grant on January 3, 2020, each acquisition was subsequently reported in a From 4 filed on June 12, 2020; the acquisition by each of Ms. Thomas and Mr. Lippert of common stock on February 3, 2020, each acquisition was subsequently reported in a Form 4 filed on June 12, 2020; the acquisition by each of Mr. Weijermars, Ms. Thomas, Ms. Vitale and Mr. van Sante of stock options granted on June 5, 2020, each acquisition was subsequently reported in a From 4 filed on June 12, 2020; and the acquisition by each of Mr. Lippert and Mr. Jimenez-Tu\u00f1on of common stock on June 5, 2020, each acquisition was subsequently reported in a From 4 filed on June 12, 2020.\nCode of Conduct\nWe have adopted a code of conduct that outlines the principles, policies and laws that govern our activities and establishes guidelines for conduct in the workplace. The code of conduct applies to our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer, all other employees, affiliates, and each member of our Board of Directors. All employees are required to read the code of conduct and affirm in writing their acceptance of the code. Our code of conduct is posted on our website, www.Pareteum.com.

The following is a summary of our principal risks, as set forth in the section entitled \u201c",
    "item_7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The following discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOverview\nPurpose built for the cloud, Cyren was an early pioneer and leading innovator of cloud delivered Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) cybersecurity solutions that protect businesses, their employees, and customers against threats from email, files, and the web.\nCyren\u2019s cloud-based approach to cybersecurity sets us apart from other vendors in the market. Our security solutions are architected around the fundamental belief that cybersecurity is a race against time - and the cloud best enables the speed, sophistication and advanced automation needed to detect and block threats as they emerge on the internet around the globe. As more and more businesses move their data and applications to the cloud, they need a security provider that is able to keep pace.\nSecurity threats are more prevalent and stealthier than ever. As cybercrime has become more sophisticated, every malware, phishing and ransomware variant is unique, making it more difficult to detect attacks. While organizations have traditionally protected their users with gateway security appliances at their network perimeter, more frequent and evasive attacks combined with a more distributed workforce are reducing the effectiveness of this approach. Traditional appliances lack the real-time threat intelligence and processing power to detect emerging threats, and the growth of mobile devices and an increasingly distributed workforce mean that more and more business is conducted outside of the traditional network perimeter. As a result, when new attacks appear in a matter of seconds, legacy cybersecurity products can leave companies vulnerable for hours, days or even weeks.\nCyren\u2019s cloud security products and services fall into three categories:\n\u25cf Cyren Threat Detection Services - these services detect a variety of threats in email and from the web, and are embedded into products from the world\u2019s leading technology and security vendors. Cyren Threat Detection Services include our Email Security Detection Engine, Malware Detection Engine, Web Security Engine, and Threat Analysis Service.\n\u25cf Cyren Threat Intelligence Data - Cyren\u2019s Threat Intelligence Data provide valuable threat intelligence data that can be used by enterprise or OEM customers to support threat detection, threat hunting and incident response. Cyren\u2019s Threat Intelligence Data offerings include IP Reputation Intelligence, Phishing Intelligence, Malware Intelligence and Zombie Intelligence.\n\u25cf Cyren Enterprise Email Security Products - these include cloud-based solutions designed for enterprise customers, and are sold either directly or through channel partners. Cyren Enterprise Email Security products include Cyren Email Security, a cloud-based secure email gateway and Cyren Inbox Security, an anti-phishing product for Office 365.\nKey Opportunities and Challenges\nThreat Landscape\nThe last several years have possibly experienced the greatest amount of dramatic global incidents directly related to malware and cyber threats since the advent of the internet. From election hacks to global ransomware attacks, malware threats are at an all-time high. Phishing attacks have become increasingly common, and no company, large or small seems immune to these threats. Hackers have become more successful at monetizing these attacks, and as long as these activities prove lucrative, we expect these incidents to continue.\nCloud and Mobility\nBusinesses are going through a massive change in their IT strategies as they look to drive more business value, agility, and better customer experiences, while cloud and mobility are becoming increasingly important, as evidenced by the following trends:\n\u25cf Business internet traffic continues to increase every year;\n\u25cf Data and applications are increasingly moving to the cloud;\n\u25cf More and more users are working remotely;\n\u25cf Buyers continue to move away from traditional on-premise solutions;\n\u25cf Mature and legacy on premise deployments are reaching end of life and are increasingly being replaced by cloud and SaaS alternatives;\n\u25cf IT security staffing shortages;\n\u25cf Increasingly fast, sophisticated, expensive, and high-profile attacks target organizations of all sizes;\n\u25cf Compliance and regulatory mandates;\n\u25cf Heightened cybercrime activity among commercial enterprises and nation states;\n\u25cf Automation is increasingly considered critical to accelerating detection and protection;\n\u25cf The need to simplify operations through vendor consolidation.\nThese are some of the reasons why we believe Cyren\u2019s vision for 100% cloud security is compelling to IT security teams looking to protect their businesses in today\u2019s cloud-centric mobile-first world.\nInvestments in Operations, Research and Development and Sales and Marketing\nOur cost of revenues, research and development expenses, and sales and marketing expenses are all significant contributing factors to our operating losses. Over time, we expect that our utilization of our cloud infrastructure will increase and provide the opportunity for improved gross margins. Our investments in research and development are required in order to enhance and improve our solutions. In the future, we expect to lower the rate of R&D investment as a percentage of revenue. The return on our sales and marketing investment is tied to attracting new customers and enhancing our business with existing customers, thereby lowering the overall sales and marketing costs as a percent of revenues. During 2020 we reduced our overall headcount in order to reduce expenses, and we believe managing future headcount and expense growth will be key in improving our gross and operating margins over time.\nGrowing Our Enterprise Business\nAlthough all of our services are subscription services, our Enterprise offerings are typically invoiced up front for an annual contract amount, or the full multi-year contract amount, at the start of the term. As a result, this business is expected to provide a larger immediate contribution to cash flow and better return on investment. As this enterprise business grows as a portion of our overall revenues, we expect to increase deferred revenue and our operating results and cash flow to improve, which will make us less reliant on other sources of capital in the future.\nComponents of our Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe derive revenues from the sale of real-time cloud-based services for each of Cyren\u2019s email security, web security, antimalware, and advanced threat protection offerings.\nWe sell all of our solutions as subscription services, either to OEMs and service providers or directly or indirectly to enterprises.\nCost of Revenue\nPersonnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation for employees that operate our network and provide support services to our customers, as well as data center costs, are the most significant components of our cost of revenues. Other costs include third party contractors, royalties for use of third-party technologies, amortization of intangibles and depreciation of data center equipment. We expect these costs may increase in absolute dollars as we continue to optimize our cloud infrastructure and our support services, but should reduce as a percentage of overall revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, are the most significant component of our operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, IT, and depreciation. We expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to grow.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consists primarily of personnel costs, outsourced engineering, and threat analysis services. We believe these investments are crucial for our ability to continue to enhance the functionality of our services, as well as to develop and introduce new services to the market. We expect research and development expenses may increase in 2021 as we support newly released products in 2020. Development costs related to internal use technology that supports our security services are capitalized on the balance sheet, while other development costs are expensed as they are incurred.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses primarily include personnel costs, sales commissions, marketing activities, and travel associated with sales and marketing. We market and sell our services worldwide through our sales organization and distribution channels. We capitalize sales commissions paid to internal sales personnel and amortize these expenses over an estimated period of benefit that reflects the expected future revenue streams. We reduced sales and marketing expense in 2020 but anticipate that we may need to increase investment in these areas related to new products launched in 2020 and enhance our sales and marketing efforts to support our further growth. Our sales personnel are typically not immediately productive, and therefore the increase in expenses we incur when adding personnel is not immediately accompanied by increased revenue and in some cases may not result in increased revenue if these new sales personnel are unsuccessful in becoming productive.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, audit fees, legal expenses, recruiting expenses and other general operating costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars as we continue our operational growth.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists generally of capital gain or loss from the sale of assets. However, in the first quarter of 2019, we reached a financial settlement with the former shareholders of eleven related to the legal dispute regarding the amount and timing of the earn-out payments related to the acquisition of eleven (the \u201celeven settlement\u201d). Since the financial settlement was less than the accrued interest and the unpaid earn-out consideration on the Company\u2019s balance sheet, the difference was reflected as other income during the period.\nFinancial Expenses, net\nFinancial expenses, net consist mainly of foreign exchange gains and losses, interest expense on our outstanding debt and interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. In 2019 and 2020, these expenses also included income related to the accounting for a multi-year arrangement where a customer paid upfront the full contract value. This has been deemed a significant financing component under ASC 606.\nTax Benefit\nOur tax benefit is derived primarily from income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves determining income tax expense together with calculating the deferred income tax expense related to temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included net as applicable within our balance sheets. For most of our recent years, we have incurred operating losses in Israel and the U.S., where we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth financial data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\nRevenues $ 36,388 $ 38,391\nCost of revenues 14,786 15,557\nGross profit 21,602 22,834\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development, net 16,083 15,801\nSales and marketing 11,678 13,825\nGeneral and administrative 9,583 10,877\nTotal operating expenses 37,344 40,503\nOperating loss (15,742 ) (17,669 )\nOther income, net\nFinancial expenses, net ($590 and $567 attributable to related parties, respectively) (1,647 ) (727 )\nLoss before taxes on income (17,384 ) (18,130 )\nTax benefit\nNet loss $ (17,263 ) $ (18,018 )\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenues. 2020 revenues of $36.4 million decreased by $2.0 million from $38.4 million in 2019, which represents a 5% year-over-year decrease. Revenues for the fourth quarter included a one-time reduction of $0.7 million as a result of a multi-year customer contract that was restructured. Additionally, the decrease was driven by renewals of customer contracts at lower values, expiration of a small number of customer contracts in the Threat Intelligence business, and the end of life of several legacy Enterprise products during 2020. In the second half of 2020, the Company released the newest Enterprise products, Cyren Inbox Security (launched in April 2020) and Threat InDepth (launched in June 2020). Since the product launch, the Company has signed several new customer contracts representing over $0.8 million of revenue, but due to the timing and ratable nature of the contracts, there was not a material amount recognized in 2020.\nCost of Revenues. Cost of revenues for 2020 totaling $14.8 million decreased by $0.8 million from $15.6 million in 2019, which represents an 5% decrease year-over-year. Datacenter costs increased by $0.3 million and associated fixed asset depreciation increased by $0.4 million during 2020 compared to 2019. These increases are required as a foundation for the continued growth of the business. Headcount associated with cost of revenues throughout the year decreased from 39 to 36 employees during 2020. Payroll and related expenses decreased by $0.3 million driven by lower salaries and costs associated with employee benefits. Intangible amortization expenses decreased by $0.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019, which includes a $0.2 million decrease due to additional expense in 2019 associated with recording an intangible asset impairment. No impairment was recorded in 2020. Outside services decreased $0.4 million in 2020 compared to 2019 due to efforts to reduce reliance upon outside vendors for certain services.\nResearch and Development, Net. Research and development expenses, net for 2020 totaling $16.1 million increased by $0.3 million from $15.8 million in 2019, which represents an 2% increase year-over-year. Payroll and related expenses decreased by approximately $1.5 million primarily driven by lower headcount. R&D headcount during 2020 decreased from 132 to 117 employees. Capitalization of technology development, which reduces expenses, decreased from $3.7 million in 2019 to $1.5 million in 2020, which as a result, increased expense by $2.2 million. Included within the $2.2 million increase was a one-time write-off of $0.7 million in Q3 2020 of a previously capitalized R&D project expense from prior periods that was terminated in Q3 2020. Overall, the change in capitalization of technology development was driven by higher capitalization in 2019 and early 2020 in advance of a new product launch in April 2020. Outside services and outsourced engineering expenses associated with our increased investment in R&D decreased by $0.5 million.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses for 2020 totaling $11.7 million decreased by $2.1 million, compared to $13.8 million in 2019. The change is mainly due to a $1.4 million decrease in payroll and related expenses due to lower headcount. Sales and Marketing headcount during 2020 decreased from 45 to 37 employees. Travel related costs decreased in 2020 by $0.4 million, the use of outside services associated with marketing activities decreased by $0.1 million and allocated costs from the Corp & IT department due to lower headcount in 2020 decreased by $0.2 million in 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for 2020 of $9.6 million decrease by $1.3 million, compared to $10.9 million in 2019, which represents a 12% decrease. Salary and related compensation costs increased by $0.5 million primarily driven by higher salary costs and ASC 718 (stock compensation) expense related to RSUs issued in 2020 with a 1-year vesting period offset by lower bonus and severance expense in 2020. Travel and related expenses decreased by $0.2 million driven by COVID-19 pandemic and related travel restrictions. Outside services decreased by $1.3 million due to higher legal expenses in 2019 associated with the litigation settlement of approximately $1.1 million as outlined in Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Employee recruitment decreased in 2020 by $0.3 million primarily driven by employee searches in 2019 that did not occur in 2020. G&A headcount during 2020 decreased from 32 to 31 employees.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. Other income, net for 2020 was $0.0 million, compared to an income of $0.2 million for corresponding periods last year. During the first quarter of 2019, we reached a financial settlement with the former shareholders of eleven related to the legal dispute regarding the amount and timing of the earn-out payments related to the acquisition of eleven (the \u201celeven settlement\u201d). Since the financial settlement was less than the accrued interest and the unpaid earn-out consideration on the Company\u2019s balance sheet, the difference was reflected as other income during the period. For additional information, please refer to Note 7.b(i) of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \u201cAnnual Report\u201d).\nFinancial Expense, Net. Financial expenses, net, for 2020 of $1.6 million increased by $0.9 million, compared to $0.7 million in 2019.\nFinancial expense, net is primarily made up of interest associated with the Convertible Debentures issued in March 2020 and the Convertible Notes issued in December 2018. For additional information, please refer to Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nInterest expense associated with the Convertible Notes and Debentures increased by $0.6 million in 2020 due to the Convertible Debentures issued in March 2020.\nInterest capitalized as a part of R&D capitalization, and is an offset to interest expense, decreased by $0.1 million in 2020 due to fewer projects capitalized in 2020.\nThe impact of foreign exchange fluctuation increased expense in 2020 by $0.2 million.\nEffective Corporate Tax Rates\nCorporate tax rates and real capital gains tax in Israel were 23% in 2020 and 2019. There has been no change to date in 2021.\nThe Company\u2019s German subsidiary is subject to German tax at a consolidated rate of approximately 30%.\nOther non-Israeli subsidiaries are taxed according to the tax laws in their respective countries of residence.\nWe do not provide deferred tax liabilities when we intend to reinvest earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely. As of December 31, 2020, there are no undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nWe may currently qualify as an \u201cindustrial company\u201d within the definition of the Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxation), as such, we may be eligible for certain tax benefits, including, inter alia, special depreciation rates for machinery, equipment and buildings, amortization of patents, certain other intangible property rights and deduction of share issuance expenses.\nNet Operating Loss Carry-Forwards\nAs of December 31, 2020, Cyren Ltd.\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes amounted to $108.6 million and capital loss carryforwards of $17.8 million which may be carried forward and offset against taxable income in the future, for an indefinite period.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the U.S. subsidiary had net operating loss carryforwards of $40.7 million for federal tax purposes and $10.6 million for state tax purposes. These losses may offset any future U.S. taxable income of the U.S. subsidiary and will expire in the years 2021 through 2040.\nManagement currently believes that based upon its estimations for future taxable income, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets regarding the loss carryforwards will not be utilized in the foreseeable future. Thus, a valuation allowance was provided to reduce deferred tax assets to their realizable value.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months through a combination of existing cash on hand, reducing operating spend, potentially divesting non-core assets and future issuances of equity and/or debt securities. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $248.7 million, cash and cash equivalents of $9.3 million, and generated a net loss of $17.3 million. We have incurred losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Current assets amounted to approximately $12.0 million with current liabilities of approximately $24.9 million, resulting in negative working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) of approximately $12.9 million. The current cash balance and historical trend of cash used in operations along with the maturity of the Convertible Notes in December 2021, which we are currently trying to restructure, and lack of certainty regarding a future capital raise and our ability to renegotiate the term of the Convertible Notes, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. We do not anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to pay the principal of the Convertible Notes on their maturity date. The inability to restructure or borrow sufficient funds to refinance the Convertible Notes on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, would have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform and the expansion of sales and marketing activities. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we issue additional equity securities in order to raise additional funds, further dilution to existing stockholders may occur. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPlease see the Financings section below for more details on the Company\u2019s recent efforts to fund operating activities.\nOutlook\nThe Company intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months through a combination of existing cash on hand, reducing operating spend, potentially divesting non-core assets and future issuances of equity and/or debt securities. Over the past several years, the Company has devoted most of its effort to research and development, new product development and increasing revenues through additional investments in sales and marketing. The Company generated a loss of $17.3 million and a negative cash flow of $8.4 million from operating activities in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020. However, the Company has incurred losses since inception and expects to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. The Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations, repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due and the repayment of the Convertible Notes that mature in December 2021. The Company is currently negotiating the restructuring of the Convertible Notes with the Note holders and at this time we are uncertain as to the outcome. For additional information, please refer to Note 2c of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nWe regularly have discussions with our customers regarding the renewal of their contracts and the renegotiation of the terms of such contracts at the time of renewal. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we received notification that our largest customer will renew one of their contracts for another three years through the first quarter of 2024, but that it does not intend to renew its largest contract with the Company beginning April 2021. As a result, we anticipate that quarterly revenues from this customer will drop from over 20% currently to approximately 14% of quarterly revenue beginning in the second quarter of 2021. For additional information, please refer to Note 11b of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nIn 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $8.4 million and was primarily due to a net loss of $17.3 million adjusted for non-cash activity of $2.8 million amortization of intangible assets, $2.3 million depreciation of property and equipment, $2.4 million stock-based compensation expenses, $1.5 million amortization of deferred commissions, $2.1 million in amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets associated with the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019, a $1.3 million increase in trade receivables, net and offset by a $1.9 million decrease in deferred revenues, a decrease in deferred commissions of $1.1 million, a decrease in trade payables of $0.4, and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $1.6 million.\nIn 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $6.9 million and was primarily due to a net loss of $18.0 million adjusted for non-cash activity of $3.8 million amortization of intangible assets, $1.9 million depreciation of property and equipment, $2.4 million stock-based compensation expenses, $1.2 million amortization of deferred commissions, $1.3 million in amortization of operating lease right-of-use assets associated with the adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019, $2.9 million increase in deferred revenues, $1.5 million increase in trade receivables, net and offset by a decrease in deferred commissions of $1.0 million, a decrease in trade payables of $0.7 and a decrease of $1.0 in employee and payroll accruals, accrued expenses and other liabilities and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $1.2 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nIn 2020, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $1.5 million for capitalization of technology and $1.8 million used to purchase property and equipment.\nIn 2019, net cash used in investing activities consisted of $3.7 million for capitalization of technology and $1.5 million used to purchase property and equipment.\nOur capital expenditures over the last three years consisted primarily of continued investment in R&D and also purchases of property and equipment to modernize and expand our data centers and to invest in our infrastructure in order to support new products and facilitate the growth of the Company.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nIn 2020, net cash generated by financing activities was $9.4 million attributable to the issuance of Convertible Debentures in March 2020 with gross proceeds of $10.2 million, offset by the payment of debt issuance costs of $0.8 million.\nIn 2019, net cash generated by financing activities was $6.0 million and was due to net proceeds of $8.0 million from the rights offering, $0.7 million proceeds from exercise of options, and offset by $2.7 million payment of earn-out consideration.\nWorking Capital\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had negative working capital of $12.9 million and as of December 31, 2019, we had positive working capital of $0.6 million.\nFinancings\nOn December 5, 2018, the Company issued $10.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes in a private placement to affiliates of an existing minority institutional shareholder. The Convertible Notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of Cyren and carry a 5.75% interest rate, payable semi-annually in (i) 50% cash and (ii) 50% cash or ordinary shares at Cyren\u2019s election. The notes have a 3-year term and mature in December 2021, unless converted in accordance with their terms prior to maturity. The notes were issued with a conversion price of $3.90 per share which was subject to adjustment using a weighted average ratchet mechanism based on the size and price of future equity offerings and the total shares outstanding. We are currently negotiating the restructuring of the Convertible Notes with the Note holders to postpone the final repayment date by several months under certain terms, although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOn November 7, 2019 we completed a rights offering that raised gross proceeds of $8.0 million. As a result of this offering, the conversion price of the Convertible Notes was adjusted to $3.73. In addition, the Convertible Notes are subject to immediate conversion upon any change in control in the Company (or subject to repayment if the price in the change in control transaction is less than the conversion price).\nOn March 19, 2020, we issued $10.25 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Debentures in a private placement to certain investors. The Convertible Debentures are secured by a guarantee by two of our subsidiaries and carry a 5.75% interest rate, payable semi-annually in cash or, subject to the satisfaction of certain equity conditions, in ordinary shares. The Convertible Debentures mature in March 2024, unless converted in accordance with their terms prior to maturity. The Convertible Debentures have an initial conversion price of $0.75 per share, subject to adjustments. If the closing bid price of our ordinary shares has been at least $2.25 (subject to adjustment) for at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period, and certain conditions are satisfied, we may force a conversion of all or any part of the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Debentures, accrued and unpaid interest and any other amounts then owing, subject to certain conditions.\nOn February 16, 2021, we issued to several institutional investors in a registered direct offering (the \u201cOffering\u201d), 12,000,000 of our ordinary shares at a purchase price of $1.15 per share for net proceeds of approximately $12.5 million. We intend to use the proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nWe also issued to the placement agent or its designees warrants (\u201cPlacement Agent Warrants\u201d) to purchase up to 720,000 ordinary shares (the \u201cWarrant Shares\u201d), representing 6% of the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares sold in the Offering. The Placement Agent Warrants have an exercise price equal to $1.4375, or 125% of the Offering price, per ordinary share and will be exercisable commencing on August 16, 2021 for five years from the effective date of the Offering.\nEarn-Out Consideration\nIn conjunction with the 2012 acquisition of eleven, the Company entered into an earn-out agreement with the former shareholders that would pay additional consideration based on the revenue performance for the years ending 2012-2015. Subsequently in 2014 the Company had a legal dispute regarding the amount and timing of the earn-out payments and had entered into arbitral proceedings with the former shareholders of eleven. On March 9, 2017, the Company received the arbitral judgement. Pursuant to the judgement, the earn-out consideration balance was increased to reflect additional legal expenses and interest expenses covering the period up to December 31, 2016. During 2017 and 2018, the Company continued to accrue interest on the unpaid earn-out consideration balance. Such interest is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under financial expenses, net. In May 2018, the Company made a partial payment of the earn-out consideration to five of the six former shareholders, in an amount of $604 thousand. The earn-out consideration balance presented on the Company\u2019s balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 reflects the complete remaining liability relating to the earn-out, including accrued interest. Subsequent to the reporting period, in February 2019, the parties agreed to resolve all pending claims, and on February 28, 2019 the Company paid approximately $2.7 million to settle the earn-out consideration in full. For additional information, please refer to Note 7b(i) of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nRegistration Statements\nIn connection with our private placement to Warburg Pincus in November 2017, in which we issued approximately 10.6 million ordinary shares for $1.85 per share, we and Warburg Pincus entered into a registration rights agreement, which, among other things, provides Warburg Pincus with three demand registration rights, piggyback and shelf registration rights. The demand registration rights may be exercised starting August 6, 2018, subject to certain customary blackout periods.\nIn connection with issuance of the Convertible Debentures, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the purchasers. Pursuant to that agreement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC covering the resale of our ordinary shares that are issuable to the purchasers upon any conversion of the Convertible Debentures or as interest payments.\nOn September 21, 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form with the SEC, which we converted to a Form S-3 on August 16, 2019. This registration statement enables us to issue debt securities, ordinary shares, warrants or subscription rights up to an aggregate amount of $50 million. Under the rules governing shelf registration statements, we will file a prospectus supplement with the SEC which describes the amount and type of securities being offered each time we issue securities under this registration statement. No securities were issued under the registration statement on Form. In November 2019, we issued shares as part of our rights offerings and in February 2021, we issued shares in the registered direct offering using our Form S-3 as described above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNot applicable.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis section is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company\u2019s management evaluates estimates, including those related to fair value and useful lives of intangible assets, fair value of earn-out liabilities, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, income tax uncertainties, fair values of stock-based awards, other contingent liabilities and estimates used in applying the revenue recognition policy. Such estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgements that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 1 to 20 years. Acquired customer contracts and relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives in proportion to the economic benefits realized. This accounting policy results in accelerated amortization of such customer contracts and relationships arrangements as compared to the straight-line method. Technology, intellectual property, and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company\u2019s long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360 \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset group is expected to generate. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset.\nThe Company did not record an impairment related to year-ended December 31, 2020.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we have recognized an impairment loss of $0.2 related to R&D, an acquired intangible asset from a prior acquisition. We have determined that the benefit of the acquired R&D would not be realized. This amount was recognized in cost of revenue. While this was a non-cash charge, it is expected to reduce amortization expense by $0.1 on an annualized basis.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an impairment test.\nThe Company performs an annual impairment test at December 31, of each fiscal year, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. The Company operates in one operating segment, and this segment comprises its only reporting unit.\nASC 350 prescribes a two-phase process for impairment testing of goodwill. The first phase screens for impairment, while the second phase (if necessary) measures impairment. Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value determined using market capitalization. In such case, the second phase is then performed, and the Company measures impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit\u2019s goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. ASC 350 allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. Alternatively, ASC 350 permits an entity to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. Accordingly, the Company elected to proceed directly to the first step of the quantitative goodwill impairment test and compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value.\nFor each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, no impairment losses have been identified.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, prepaid expenses, other receivables, and trade payables, approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of such financial instruments.\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. A three-tiered fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company can access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of instrument, the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment and the instruments are categorized as Level 3.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the requirements of ASC 606 under the modified retrospective method of transition which was applied to all customer contracts that were not completed on the effective date of ASC 606. The Company implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption. The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s accounting policies for revenue recognition previously recognized under ASC 605 as detailed below.\nRevenue Recognition Policy\nThe Company derives its revenues from the sale of real-time cloud-based services for each of Cyren\u2019s email security, web security, antimalware, and advanced threat protection offerings.\nThe Company sells all of its solutions as subscription services, either through OEMs, which are considered end-users, or as complete security services directly, or via our partners, to enterprises.\nThe Company recognizes revenue under the core principle that transfer of control to the Company\u2019s customers should be depicted in an amount reflecting the consideration the Company expects to receive in revenue.\nSubscription Service Revenue - Subscription service revenue is derived from a subscription-based licensing model with contract terms typically ranging from one to three years, and consists of (1) subscription fees from the licensing of the Company\u2019s Enterprise or Threat Intelligence Services and (2) subscription fees for real-time threat updates and software with support and related future updates where the software updates are critical to the customers\u2019 ability to derive benefit from the software due to the fast changing nature of the technology. These function together as one performance obligation. The hosted on-demand service arrangements do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the hosted services. Support revenue is derived from ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and maintenance. A time-elapsed method is used to measure progress because the Company transfers control evenly over the contractual period. Accordingly, the fixed consideration related to subscription service revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term beginning on the date access is provided, as long as other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Most of the company\u2019s contracts are non-cancelable over the contract term. Customers typically have the right to terminate their contract for cause if the Company fails to perform in accordance with the contractual terms. Some of the Company\u2019s customers have the option to purchase additional subscription services at a stated price. These options are evaluated on a case-by-case basis but generally do not provide a material right as they are priced at or above the Company\u2019s standalone selling price and, as such, would not result in a separate performance obligation.\nVariable Consideration - Revenue from sales is recorded at the net sales price, which is the transaction price, and includes estimates of variable consideration. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price is constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. If the Company\u2019s services or products do not meet certain service level commitments, the Company\u2019s customers are entitled to receive service credits representing a form of variable consideration. The Company has not historically experienced any significant incidents affecting the defined levels of reliability and performance as required by the Company\u2019s subscription contracts. Accordingly, there are no estimated refunds related to these contracts in the consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\nDeferred Commissions\nThe Company capitalizes sales commissions paid to internal sales personnel that are generally incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred commissions on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines whether costs should be deferred based on its sales compensation plans if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract. Sales commissions for renewal of a subscription contract are not considered commensurate with the commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial subscription contract given the substantive difference in commission rate between new and renewal contracts. Commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit while commissions paid related to renewal contracts are amortized over a contractual renewal period. Amortization is recognized based on the expected future revenue streams under the customer contracts. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Company determines the period of benefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial subscription contract by taking into consideration factors such as peer estimates of technology lives and customer lives as well as the Company\u2019s own historical data. The Company classifies deferred commissions as current or long-term based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the expense. The Company periodically reviews these deferred commission costs to determine whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit of these deferred contract acquisition costs. There were no material impairment losses recorded during the periods presented.\nCapitalized Technology\nThe Company capitalizes development costs incurred during the application development stage which are related to internal-use technology that supports its security services. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred as research and development costs on the statements of operations. Capitalized internal-use technology is included in intangible assets on the balance sheet and is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally one to three years. Amortization expenses are recognized under cost of goods sold. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nASC 718 - \u201cCompensation-stock Compensation\u201d- (\u201cASC 718\u201d) requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for the value of its awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of each of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures. Estimated forfeitures are based on actual historical pre-vesting forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Estimated forfeitures are based on actual historical pre-vesting forfeitures (pursuant to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, the Company made a policy election to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest).\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The option-pricing model requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are the expected stock price volatility and the expected option term. Expected volatility was calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods ending on the grant date, equal to the expected term of the options. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, based upon historical experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield from U.S. treasury bonds with an equivalent term. The Company has historically not paid dividends and has no foreseeable plans to pay dividends.\nThe Company applies ASC 718, and ASC 505-50, \u201cEquity Based Payments to Non-Employees\u201d (\u201cASC 505-50\u201d), with respect to options issued to non-employees.\nThe fair value for options granted in 2020 and 2019 is estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes options pricing model with the following assumptions:\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\nStock options\nVolatility 47% - 60 % 46% - 50 %\nRisk-free interest rate 0.23% - 1.40 % 1.5% - 2.5 %\nDividend yield 0 % 0 %\nExpected life (years) 3.9-4.1 3.7-4.0\nAccounting for Income Tax\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be realized.\nASC 740 contains a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring a liability for uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% (cumulative basis) likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset, or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNot applicable.",

An annual general meeting must be held at least once in every calendar year, but not more than 15 months after the preceding annual general meeting. Directors may be removed and other directors may be elected in their place or to fill vacancies in the Board at any time by the holders of a majority of the voting power at a general meeting of the shareholders. Until a vacancy is filled by the shareholders, the Board may appoint new directors temporarily to fill vacancies on the Board. Our Articles of Association authorize the shareholders to determine, from time to time, the number of directors.\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder require our directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports with the SEC relating to their share ownership and changes in such ownership. Based on a review of our records and certain written representations received from our executive officers and directors, we believe that during the year ended December 31, 2020, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to directors, executive officers and greater than 10% shareholders were complied with on a timely basis."

    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are one of the leading Nasdaq publicly traded cryptocurrency mining companies operating in North America. We have made the strategic decision to focus our efforts on mining bitcoin by deploying special cryptocurrency mining computers (known in the industry as \u201cminers\u201d) designed to mine for bitcoin. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we exclusively operated the Antminer series of miners manufactured by Bitmain Technologies Limited (\u201cBitmain\u201d) to mine bitcoin and, to a much lesser extent, litecoin. We generate substantially all our revenue through our cryptocurrency mining operation. We generate revenue from the cryptocurrency we earn through our mining activities, which we may hold for our own account and or sell at prices and times as determined by our executive management team in accordance with our corporate strategy. The Company is also exploring innovative cryptocurrency mining technologies and other strategic initiatives as part of a continual effort to maximize the energy efficiency and cost effectiveness of its cryptocurrency mining activities.\nCryptocurrency Mining\nWe seek to mine bitcoin by using our miners to solve complex cryptographic algorithms to support the Bitcoin blockchain (in a process known as \u201csolving a block\u201d). In return for solving a block, we receive a bitcoin or other cryptocurrency reward, depending on the blockchain, which we hold for our account and attempt to sell on the market to generate a profit.\nMiners measure their capability in terms of processing power, which is known as in the industry as \u201chashing\u201d power. Hashing power is measured in terms of the number of hashing algorithms solved (or \u201chashes\u201d) per second, which is the miner\u2019s \u201chash rate.\u201d Generally speaking, miners with greater hashing power relative to other miners attempting to solve a block have a higher chance of solving the block and receiving a cryptocurrency award. However, although newer generations of miners advertise improved energy efficiency, we have observed that increasing hash rate generally requires greater electrical power, which increases the cost of solving a block and, therefore, the relative cost of mining a cryptocurrency. As additional miners competed for the limited supply of blocks, individuals found that they were working for months without finding a block and receiving any reward for their mining efforts. To address this variance, miners started organizing into pools to share mining rewards more evenly on a pro rata basis based on total hashing capacity contributed to the mining pool.\nParticipation in Mining Pools\nA \u201cmining pool\u201d is the pooling of resources by miners, who share their processing power over a network and split rewards according to the amount of hashing power they contributed to the probability of placing a block on the blockchain. Mining pools emerged in response to the growing difficulty and available hashing power that competes to place a block on the bitcoin blockchain.\nThe Company participates in mining pool(s) wherein groups of miners associate to pool their resources together to earn cryptocurrency rewards, which are allocated to each miner according to the \u201chashing\u201d capacity they contribute to the pool. The mining pool operator provides a service that coordinates the computing power of the independent mining enterprises participating in the mining pool. Fees are paid to the mining pool operator to cover the costs of maintaining the pool. The pool uses software that coordinates the pool members\u2019 hashing power, identifies new block rewards, records how much work all the participants are doing, and assigns block rewards for successful algorithm solutions in-proportion to the individual hash rate that each participant contributed to a given successful mining transaction. While we do not pay pool fees directly, pool fees are deducted from amounts we may otherwise earn. Fees (and payouts) fluctuate and historically have been no more than approximately 2% per reward earned, on average. Mining pools are subject to various risks such as disruption and down time. In the event that a pool experiences down time or is not yielding returns, our results may be impacted.\nMining Equipment\nAll of the miners we operate were manufactured by Bitmain, and incorporate application-specific integrated circuit (\u201cASIC\u201d) chips specialized to solve blocks on the bitcoin blockchains using the 256-bit secure hashing algorithm (\u201cSHA-256\u201d) in return for bitcoin cryptocurrency rewards. Therefore, the only cryptocurrencies we are able to mine using the miners we presently employ or have ordered from Bitmain are those whose blockchain uses SHA-256, including bitcoin. If cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin, cease using SHA-256, we would likely incur significant costs to replace our existing miners. We are continually evaluating the effectiveness of the miners we purchase from Bitmain and we continuously explore new technology developments from Bitmain and other manufacturers, including manufacturers located in Asia, Europe, and domestically in the United States.\nIn late 2019, the Company made a strategic decision to concentrate on increasing its overall hash rate and to update its fleet of miners by acquiring the latest generation Antminer series of miners directly from Bitmain to replace the approximately 7,500 legacy model S9 miners manufactured by Bitmain, which the Company had acquired in third-party transactions in 2017 and 2018. The Company has chosen to focus on acquiring the latest generation of the Antminers directly from Bitmain because the Company\u2019s management believes, both in terms of hash rate produced and energy efficiency, these new Antminers are the most powerful and energy efficient miners available on the market in sufficient quantities to meet our needs; however, advances and improvements to the technology are ongoing and may be available in quantities to the market in the near future which may affect our perceived position.\nThe Company began the process of upgrading its existing mining fleet by ordering ordered 4,000 model S17-Pro Antminers directly from Bitmain in December 2019 for a total purchase price of approximately $6.3 million, which was paid in 2019. All 4,000 of these new Bitmain model S17-Pro Antminers were received and deployed at the Company\u2019s former Oklahoma City, Oklahoma mining facility (the \u201cOKC Facility\u201d) by February 2020. As discussed in greater detail under the section entitled \u201cMining Facility\u201d below, the Company relocated all 4,000 of these new model S17-Pro Antminers from the OKC Facility to the current mining facility of Coinmint LLC, a colocation facility located in Massena, New York in the second quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nIndex\nBeginning in April 2020, the Company began a series of acquisitions of the latest generation Bitmain model S19 series of Antminers and began retiring its older model S9 miners. As of December 31, 2020, the Company operated a fleet of 7,043 model S17-Pro, S19, and S19-Pro Antminers, and had ordered an additional 30,603 new model S19-Pro, A19 and S19j-Pro Antminers, form Bitmain.\nAs set forth in the applicable purchase agreements previously disclosed by the Company as exhibits to current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC, which are incorporated by reference herein and included as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company pre-paid significant portions of the purchase price for these new Antminers as refundable deposits, with delivery scheduled to occur in installments through October 2021, and the remainder of the purchase price for these new Antminers is payable in installments, with payment due in advance of the scheduled delivery dates set forth in the applicable purchase agreement.\nMiner Deliveries Subsequent to December 31, 2020.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company received the following shipments of new Bitmain Antminers purchased in 2020:\n\u2022\n2,500 model S19-Pro Antminers in January 2021;\n\u2022\n2,002 model S19-Pro Antminers in February 2021; and\n\u2022\n2,201 model S19-Pro Antminers in March 2021.\nPursuant to the schedules as set forth in the applicable purchase agreement, the remaining 11,900 model S19-Pro Antminers are set to be delivered in monthly installments through August 2021. The 12,000 model S19j-Pro Antminers purchased by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2020 are expected to be delivered during September through November 2021, according to the schedule set forth on the applicable purchase agreement.\nMiner Purchases Subsequent to December 31, 2020.\nAs reported by the Company on its current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 17, 2021, the Company ordered 1,500 model S19j (90TH/s) Antminers from Bitmain for approximately $7.2 million pursuant to a purchase agreement dated as of March 11, 2021, between the Company and Bitmain. Consistent with previous Bitmain agreements, the Company prepaid a significant portion of the total purchase price as a refundable deposit, with the remainder due in advance of delivery of the miners, which is expected to occur during late October 2021.\nWith the full deployment of all 32,103 new Bitmain model S19-Pro, S19j-Pro, and S19j Antminers delivered or scheduled to be delivered in 2021, our total fleet will consist of 39,146 total model S17-Pro, S19 and S19 Pro Antminers, each having a substantially greater hash rate capacity and electrical power usage efficiency than the Bitmain model S9 Antminers we previously operated. The Company considers this a substantial step forward towards its goal of developing an increasingly powerful and efficient bitcoin miner fleet in order to produce a greater overall hash rate capacity.\nMining Facility\nAfter evaluating the Company\u2019s lease arrangement and power costs at its former Oklahoma mining facility (the \u201cOKC Facility\u201d), the Company made the strategic decision to explore alternative mining locations to reduce its overhead and operating costs. Effective as of April 8, 2020, the Company and Coinmint, LLC (\u201cCoinmint\u201d) entered into a co-location mining services agreement (the \u201cCoinmint Agreement\u201d) which enabled the Company to relocate all of its miners from the OKC Facility to Coinmint\u2019s Massena, New York facility (the \u201cCoinmint Facility\u201d) and to allow its lease of the OKC Facility to expire by its terms as of June 30, 2020.\nPursuant to the terms of the Coinmint Agreement, Coinmint provides electric power and performs all maintenance necessary to operate Riot\u2019s miners at the Coinmint Facility. In exchange, Coinmint receives a performance fee based on the net cryptocurrencies earned by Riot\u2019s miners deployed at the Coinmint Facility and is reimbursed for direct production expenses. The relocation to the Coinmint Facility reduced the Company\u2019s overhead and operating costs, increased the overall uptime of its miners, and provided Riot with the opportunity to continue to expand its total hash rate capacity with potential access to additional megawatts of electric power, as compared to the former OKC Facility. The initial six (6) month term of the Coinmint Agreement ended on October 8, 2020 and was automatically renewed for a subsequent three (3) month term, which, by the terms of the Coinmint Agreement, is set to automatically renew for successive three (3) month terms until terminated.\nThe Company is currently evaluating an amendment to the Coinmint Agreement to revise, among other provisions, the total available electric power and the total number of miners it may deploy at the Coinmint Facility under the Coinmint Agreement. The Company continually evaluates its mining performance, including the status of the Coinmint Agreement, and as part of this evaluation, the Company may explore alternative mining facilities and mining arrangements in connection with its short-, medium- and long-term strategic planning.\nIndex\nPerformance Metrics\nHash Rate\nRiot operates mining hardware which performs computational operations in support of the blockchain measured in \u201chash rate\u201d or \u201chashes per second.\u201d A \u201chash\u201d is the computation run by mining hardware in support of the blockchain; therefore, a miner\u2019s \u201chash rate\u201d refers to the rate at which it is capable of solving such computations. The original equipment used for mining bitcoin utilized the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of a computer to mine various forms of cryptocurrency. Due to performance limitations, CPU mining was rapidly replaced by the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which offers significant performance advantages over CPUs. General purpose chipsets like CPUs and GPUs have since been replaced in the mining industry by ASIC chips like those found in the model S17-Pro, S19, S19-Pro, S19j and S19j-Pro Antminers Riot uses and plans to continue to use to mine bitcoin. These ASIC chips are designed specifically to maximize the rate of hashing operations of the miners in which they are installed; however, because they are specialized to operate SHA-256, if bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies cease using SHA-256 as the secure hashing algorithm support their blockchain, our miners may have to be replaced, which would likely require a significant capital expenditure by the Company.\nHash Rate Capacity\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s operational fleet of 7,043 model S17-Pro, S19, and S19-Pro Antminers was capable of producing an estimated aggregate hash rate (the Company\u2019s \u201chash rate capacity\u201d) of approximately 0.57 exahash per second (EH/s), while utilizing approximately 20 megawatt (MW) of electrical energy. This hash rate capacity represents an increase of approximately 461% over the hash rate capacity previously capable of being generated by the Company\u2019s older generation model S9 miners as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company had received a total of 13,746 Antminers from Bitmain and once fully deployed, are expected to produce an estimated hash rate capacity of approximately 1.3 EH/s, while utilizing approximately 43 MW of electrical energy. This hash rate capacity represents an increase of approximately 1,191% over the hash rate capacity previously capable of being generated by the Company\u2019s older generation model S9 miners as of December 31, 2019.\nWith the full deployment of all of the latest generation Antminers the Company has ordered from Bitmain as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company\u2019s total mining fleet will comprise 39,146 Model S17-Pro, S19, and S19-Pro Antminers. Each of these 39,146 advanced miners are capable of producing a substantially greater hash rate and use electrical power more efficiently than the older generation model S9 miners we previously operated. At full deployment, the Company\u2019s management estimates that the Company\u2019s total miner fleet will be capable of producing a hash rate capacity of approximately 4.0 EH/s, while utilizing approximately 127 MW of electrical power, which will represent an increase of approximately 3,824% over the hash rate capacity previously capable of being generated by the Company\u2019s older generation model S9 miners as of December 31, 2019. The Company\u2019s management considers this a substantial step forward towards its goal of developing an increasingly powerful and efficient bitcoin miner fleet to produce a greater overall hash rate capacity.\nNetwork Hash Rate\nIn cryptocurrency mining, hash rate is a measure of the processing speed by a mining computer for a specific coin. An individual miner, such as Riot, has a hash rate total of its miners seeking to mine a specific coin, and the blockchain-wide hash rate for a specific coin (its \u201cNetwork Hash Rate\u201d) can be understood as the aggregate of the hash rates of all of the miners actively trying to solve a block on the coin\u2019s blockchain at a given time. Generally, the greater the proportion of a specific coin\u2019s Network Hash Rate that an individual miner\u2019s (or a miner pool\u2019s) total hash rate represents will, over time, result in a greater chance of that miner solving a block on the coin\u2019s blockchain and, therefore, of earning a cryptocurrency reward, as compared to miners with relatively lower total hash rates.\nHowever, as the relative market price for a coin increases, more miners are encouraged to attempt to mine the coin, which increases the coin\u2019s Network Hash Rate. Therefore, a miner must increase its total hash rate just to maintain its relative possibility of solving a block on the coin\u2019s blockchain. Thus, a feedback loop is created: as a coin gains popularity and its relative market price increases, more miners attempt to mine the coin and its Network Hash Rate is increased; in response, existing miners and new miners devote more and more hash rate to the coin\u2019s blockchain in a process that should, theoretically, replicate itself continually until the supply of available coins is exhausted. Finally, as more and more hash rate is needed to maintain competitiveness on a given coin\u2019s blockchain, miners deploy more and more machines, which require electrical power to operate, both to directly power hash rate production and also to dissipate the significant amount of heat generated by the machines\u2019 operation. Therefore, as more hash rate is generated, more electric power is consumed, which generally increases the cost of mining a given coin.\nIn response, miners have attempted to achieve greater hash rate by deploying increasingly sophisticated miners in ever greater quantities. This has become the cryptocurrency mining industry\u2019s great \u201carms race.\u201d There are very few manufacturers of miners capable of producing a sufficient number of machines of adequate quality to meet this need, and scarcity results. Compounding this phenomenon, we have seen reports that Bitmain, the largest manufacturer of bitcoin miners, increases its prices for new machines as the market price of bitcoin increases.\nIndex\nAs a miner of primarily bitcoin, the oldest and most widely mined cryptocurrency, the Company is continually seeking to maximize its relative hash rate on the Bitcoin blockchain, while keeping costs as low as possible. The Company\u2019s goal, therefore, is to acquire and deploy as powerful of a fleet of miners as possible, while operating as energy-efficiently as possible. To date, this has involved acquiring large numbers of the latest generation Antminer series of miners manufactured by Bitmain, because the Company\u2019s management believes, to the best of their knowledge, that the S17-Pro, S19, S19-Pro, S19j, and S19j-Pro Antminers offer the best mix of hash rate capacity, reliability, energy efficiency, and cost.\nMining Results\nMining Production and Cryptocurrency Sales\nThe Company measures the success of its operations, in one respect, by the number and U.S. Dollar (US$) value of the cryptocurrency rewards it earns from its cryptocurrency mining activities. The following table presents additional information regarding our cryptocurrency mining operations, including cryptocurrency production and sales of the cryptocurrency the Company mines, expressed in terms of quantities of coins, including bitcoin (\u201cBTC\u201d), litecoin (\u201cLTC\u201d) and bitcoin cash (\u201cBCH\u201d), mined and in amounts (in thousands of US$):\nQuantities (in coins)\nCryptocurrencies\nBTC\nLTC\nBCH\nAmounts\nBalance at January 1, 2019\n3,082\n-\n$\nRevenue recognized from cryptocurrencies mined\n3,477\n6,741\nMining pool operating fees\n-\n-\n-\n(135\n)\nProceeds from sale of cryptocurrencies\n(585\n)\n(3,110\n)\n(499\n)\n(3,196\n)\nPurchase of miner equipment with cryptocurrencies\n(9\n)\n-\n-\n(99\n)\nRealized gain on sale/exchange of cryptocurrencies\n-\n-\n-\nImpairment of cryptocurrencies\n-\n-\n-\n(844\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2019\n3,449\n3,839\nRevenue recognized from cryptocurrencies mined\n1,033\n-\n11,984\nMining pool operating fees\n-\n-\n-\n(146\n)\nProceeds from sale of cryptocurrencies\n(500\n)\n-\n-\n(8,298\n)\nRealized gain on sale/exchange of cryptocurrencies\n(3,470\n)\n-\n5,184\nImpairment of cryptocurrencies\n-\n-\n-\n(989\n)\nCryptocurrencies received from sale of equipment\n-\n-\nBalance at December 31, 2020\n1,078\n-\n$\n11,626\nAs the above table shows, the Company increased the quantity of bitcoin rewards earned from its cryptocurrency mining operations from 944 in fiscal year 2019, to 1,033 in fiscal year 2020, representing an increase of approximately 9.4% in the number of bitcoin mined. As part of the strategy enacted in December 2019 to focus on using our miners to support the bitcoin blockchain by solving blocks as part of mining pools in exchange for bitcoin rewards, the Company significantly curtailed its litecoin and bitcoin cash mining activities and only received 21 litecoin rewards and did not receive any bitcoin cash rewards from operations during fiscal year 2020. Despite this, the US$ amount of revenue the Company recognized from its cryptocurrency mining activities increased from approximately $6,741 during fiscal year 2019 to $11,984 during fiscal year 2020, representing an increase of approximately 78% in revenue from the Company\u2019s mining operations. As discussed in greater detail in the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K entitled \u201cFactors Affecting Profitability\u201d below, this is largely attributable to the increased market price of bitcoin during fiscal year 2020.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the new revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:\nStep 1: Identify the contract with the customer;\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract;\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price;\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nIndex\nIn order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606\u2019s definition of a \u201cdistinct\u201d good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct), and the entity\u2019s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\nIf a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:\n\u2022\nVariable consideration;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nConstraining estimates of variable consideration;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nThe existence of a significant financing component in the contract;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nNoncash consideration; and\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nConsideration payable to a customer.\u2009\u2009\nVariable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate.\nThe Company has entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts with the mining pool operators for Riot to provide its computing power to the mining pool. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and the Company\u2019s enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company provides computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator receives (less net digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are recorded as a component of cost of revenues), for successfully adding a block to the blockchain. The Company\u2019s fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm.\nProviding computing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company\u2019s ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only performance obligation in the Company\u2019s contracts with mining pool operators. The transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration, which the Company measures at fair value on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time the Company has earned the award from the pools. The consideration is all variable. It is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will occur, and the consideration is constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and when the Company receives confirmation of the consideration it will receive, at which time the revenue is recognized. There is no significant financing component in these transactions.\nFair value of the cryptocurrency award received is determined using the market rate of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt.\nIndex\nThere is currently no specific definitive guidance under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") or alternative accounting framework for the accounting for cryptocurrencies recognized as revenue or held, and management has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In the event authoritative guidance is enacted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the Company may be required to change its policies, which could have an effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position and results from operations.\nFactors Affecting Profitability\nMarket Price of Bitcoin\nOur business is heavily dependent on the spot price of bitcoin. The prices of cryptocurrencies, specifically bitcoin, have experienced substantial volatility, which may reflect \u201cbubble\u201d type volatility, meaning that high or low prices may have little or no merit, may be subject to rapidly changing investor sentiment, and may be influenced by factors such as technology, regulatory void or changes, fraudulent actors, manipulation, and media reporting. Bitcoin (as well as other cryptocurrencies) may have value based on various factors, including their acceptance as a means of exchange by consumers and producers, scarcity, and market demand.\nHalving\nFurther affecting the industry, and particularly for the Bitcoin blockchain, the cryptocurrency reward for solving a block is subject to periodic incremental halving. Halving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm. At a predetermined block, the mining reward is cut in half, hence the term \u201chalving\u201d. For bitcoin, our most significant cryptocurrency asset to which the majority of our mining power is devoted, the reward was initially set at 50 bitcoin currency rewards per block. The Bitcoin blockchain has undergone halving three times since its inception as follows: (1) on November 28, 2012 at block 210,000; (2) on July 9, 2016 at block 420,000; (3) on May 11, 2020 at block 630,000, when the reward was reduced to its current level of 6.25 bitcoin per block. The next halving for the Bitcoin blockchain is anticipated to occur in March 2024 at block 840,000. This process will reoccur until the total amount of bitcoin currency rewards issued reaches 21 million and the theoretical supply of new bitcoin is exhausted, which is expected to occur around 2140. Many factors influence the price of bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies we mine for, and potential increases or decreases in prices in advance of or following a future halving is unknown.\nCompetition\nOur business environment is constantly evolving, and cryptocurrency miners can range from individual enthusiasts to professional mining operations with dedicated data centers. The Company competes with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on mining activities at scale. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners, the ability to raise capital, obtaining the lowest cost of electricity, obtaining access to energy sites with reliable sources of power, and evaluating new technology developments in the industry.\nAt present, the information concerning the activities of these enterprises may not be readily available as the vast majority of the participants in this sector do not publish information publicly or the information may be unreliable. Published sources of information include \u201cbitcoin.org\u201d and \u201cblockchain.info\u201d; however, the reliability of that information and its continued availability cannot be assured.\nWe believe, based on available data, that the trend of increasing market prices for bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies we observed beginning in the third fiscal quarter of calendar year 2020 has resulted in an increase in the scale and sophistication of competition in the cryptocurrency mining industry, with new entrants and existing competitors gaining access to substantial capital resources to build larger and larger mining operations. If this trend of increasing market prices for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continues, which we believe has occurred (though with significant volatility) into calendar year 2021, we believe many new and existing competitors may be encouraged to build or scale bitcoin mining operations.\nDespite this trend, we believe, based on available data and assuming full deployment of the miners we have ordered from Bitmain, we have and will continue to maintain a competitive hash rate capacity among both public and private bitcoin miners. However, to stay competitive in our evolving industry, both against new entrants into the market and existing competitors, we anticipate that we will have to continue to expand our existing miner fleet by purchasing the latest generation of miners, as well as innovating to develop and implement new technologies and mining solutions.\nSeveral public companies (traded in the U.S. and internationally) and private companies may be considered to compete with us, including the following companies which we have identified as our competitors:\nIndex\n\u2022\nArgo Blockchain PLC;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nBit Digital, Inc.;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nBitcoin Investment Trust;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nBitfarms Technologies Ltd. (formerly Blockchain Mining Ltd);\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nBlockchain Industries, Inc. (formerly Omni Global Technologies, Inc.);\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nDigihost International, Inc.;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nDMG Blockchain Solutions Inc.;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nDPW Holdings, Inc. (through its ownership of Digital Farms Inc.);\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nGMO Internet, Inc.;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nGalaxy Digital Holdings Ltd.;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nHashChain Technology, Inc.;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nHive Blockchain Technologies Inc.;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nHut 8 Mining Corp.;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nLayer1 Technologies, Inc.;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nMarathon Digital Holdings, Inc.;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nMGT Capital Investments, Inc.;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nNorthern Data AG;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nOverstock.com Inc.;\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nSOS Limited; and\u2009\u2009\n\u2022\nSBI Holdings.\u2009\u2009\nIndex\nGovernment Regulation\nBlockchain and Bitcoin are increasingly becoming subject to governmental regulation, both in the U.S. and internationally. State and local regulations also may apply to our activities and other activities in which we may participate in the future. Other governmental or semi-governmental regulatory bodies have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain or cryptocurrency business. For instance, the Cyber-Digital Task Force of the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) published a report entitled \u201cCryptocurrency: An Enforcement Framework\u201d in October 2020. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the possible threats and enforcement challenges the DOJ views as associated with the use and prevalence of cryptocurrency, as well as the regulatory and investigatory means the DOJ has at its disposal to deal with these possible threats and challenges. Further, in early March 2021, the SEC chairperson nominee expressed an intent to focus on investor protection issues raised by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nPresently, we do not believe any U.S. or State regulatory body has taken any action or position adverse to our main cryptocurrency, bitcoin, with respect to its production, sale, and use as a medium of exchange; however, future changes to existing regulations or entirely new regulations may affect our business in ways it is not presently possible for us to predict with any reasonable degree of reliability.\nFurther, following the appreciation of the market price of bitcoin in the second half of 2020, we have observed increasing media attention directed at the environmental concerns associated with cryptocurrency mining, particularly its energy-intensive nature. While we do not believe any U.S.-based regulators have taken a position adverse to bitcoin mining, in March 2021, we became aware of the actions taken by the governmental authorities for the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia, which represents roughly 8% of the world\u2019s total mining power, to outright ban bitcoin mining in the province due to the industry\u2019s intense electrical power demands and its negative environmental impacts (both in terms of the waste produced by mining the rare Earth metals used to manufacture miners and the production of electrical power used in bitcoin mining). While we have yet to see whether these miners will be able to relocate to another location in China to continue mining, this action serves as a stark reminder of the power of national and state governments to affect our industry through regulator action.\nAs the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, such as further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see the Section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d herein.\nIntellectual Property\nWe actively use specific hardware and software for our cryptocurrency mining operation. In certain cases, source code and other software assets may be subject to an open source license, as much technology development underway in this sector is open source. For these works, we intend to adhere to the terms of any license agreements that may be in place.\nWe do not currently own, and do not have any current plans to seek, any patents in connection with our existing and planned blockchain and cryptocurrency related operations. We do expect to rely upon trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property rights and expect to license the use of intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others. In addition, we have developed and may further develop certain proprietary software applications for purposes of our cryptocurrency mining operation.\nIndex\nStrategic Initiatives\nTo assist the Company with identifying new and emerging technologies, as well as other opportunities to enhance its business, the Company engaged XMS Capital Partners, LLC (\u201cXMS\u201d), an experienced M&A financial advisory firm, to identify new transaction partners and strategic opportunities for the Company in the Bitcoin space. XMS is assisting the Company in navigating the dynamic Bitcoin landscape and is advising the Company on potential strategic transactions in bitcoin mining related operations. The Company does not have a defined timeline for any transaction and cannot provide any assurance whether or when a transaction may be announced or consummated.\nLancium Pilot Project\nIn December 2020, we announced a pilot project in Houston, Texas to evaluate the use of immersion cooling technology and electric power cost management strategies for mining bitcoin in the Texas energy market. We partnered with two leading-edge technology companies, Enigma Digital Assets AG (\u201cEnigma\u201d) and Lancium, LLC (\u201cLancium\u201d) to launch the pilot project. The pilot project has the unique dual focus of evaluating Enigma\u2019s next-generation immersion technology to increase mining productivity, in addition to evaluating Lancium\u2019s Smart Response\u2122 software to reduce energy costs. This software allows data centers to adjust server electricity consumption based on power grid conditions such as price, frequency, or ancillary service revenue, which potentially unlocks significant power savings for operators. Lancium has also been advising Riot on power strategy in the Texas energy market, known as \u201cERCOT\u201d.\nImmersion cooling is a cooling technique where bitcoin mining units are submerged in a specialized fluid in order to keep the integrated circuits operating at lower temperatures. When successful, this has the potential to: prolong equipment life, enhance microchip efficiencies, and provides the opportunity to \u201coverclock\u201d the rig, i.e., running at speeds beyond factory specified design. Overclocking, including when assisted by immersion cooling, is a technique that can be used to increase a miner\u2019s overall hash rate.\nLancium will facilitate providing 8 MW of power capacity for the pilot project. The initial 3 MW will be dedicated to a current-generation Enigma immersion module, for use with S19-Pro ASIC miners. If the parties decide to proceed with the pilot project after this initial testing stage is complete, a further 5 MW may be made available for Enigma\u2019s next-generation immersion module solution, which is currently in development and expected to be available later in 2021. This next-generation immersion module solution involves proprietary ASIC chips combined with a new cooling solution. Both modules are the first of their kind from Enigma. Riot will control the pilot project with Enigma providing the immersion containers and Lancium licensing its Smart Response\u2122 software. If successful, Riot may seek to expand upon the pilot project at larger-scale sites.\nEmployees\nAs of March 25, 2021, we had eight full-time employees. We believe our employee relations to be good.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe discussion and analysis below includes certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, as described in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, that could cause our actual growth, results of operations, performance, financial position and business prospects and opportunities for this fiscal year and the periods that follow to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, those forward-looking statements. See also \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page 4 of this report.\nIndex\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company has experienced recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations. At December 31, 2020, the Company had approximate balances of cash and cash equivalents of $223.4 million, working capital of $233.9 million, total stockholders\u2019 equity of $277.1 million and an accumulated deficit of $229.9 million. To date, the Company has in large part relied on debt and equity financing to fund its operations.\nThe Company\u2019s current focus is on growing its cryptocurrency mining operation, primarily with the goal of mining bitcoin. As discussed under Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company utilizes specialized ASIC miners manufactured by Bitmain, known as Antminers. As disclosed, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company continued an ongoing process begun in late 2019 of upgrading its existing miner fleet and evaluating every level of its mining operations, with the objective to increase the Company\u2019s operational efficiency and performance.\nMiner Network Upgrade\nThe initial stage of this upgrading process began in December 2019, with the acquisition of 4,000 model S17-Pro Antminers from Bitmain, which were fully deployed at Riot\u2019s former Oklahoma City, Oklahoma mining facility (the \u201cOKC Facility\u201d), increasing Riot\u2019s overall hash rate capacity to approximately 0.25 EH/s in the first quarter of 2020.\nThroughout the year ended December 31, 2020, Riot continued its ongoing project of updating its miner fleet, making the following Antminer purchases pursuant to purchase agreements with their manufacturer, Bitmain, as disclosed by the Company on its current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC and included as exhibits hereto:\n(i)\n1,040 model S19 miners at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.94 million, all of which were delivered and installed at the Coinmint Facility by August 2020;\n(ii)\n20,606 model S19-Pro miners at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $48.4 million, 2,003 of which were delivered and installed at the Coinmint Facility by November 2020, with the remaining 18,603 scheduled to be delivered in stages through October 31, 2021; and\n(iii)\n12,000 model S19j-Pro miners at an aggregate purchase price of approximately $26.3 million, which are scheduled to be delivered in stages starting August 2021 through October 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, with all 4,000 model S17-Pro Antminers and 3,043 of the new model S19 and model S19-Pro Antminers received and deployed at the Coinmint Facility, the Company\u2019s miner fleet was capable of producing an estimated aggregate hash rate capacity of approximately 0.57 EH/s, representing an increase of approximately 461% over the Company\u2019s estimated maximum hash rate capacity as of December 31, 2019.\nIn March 2021, the Company executed an additional purchase agreement with Bitmain to acquire 1,500 Bitmain model S19j Antminers at an aggregate purchase price of $7.2 million, which are scheduled to be delivered in October 2021.\nWith the full deployment of these new model S17-Pro, S19, S19-Pro, S19j, and S19j Pro Antminers, Riot\u2019s total fleet will comprise 39,146 total Antminers. These 39,146 advanced miners have substantially greater hash rate capacities and use electric power more efficiently than the Bitmain model S9 Antminers Riot previously operated. Once all 39,146 of these newer generation Antminers have been received and deployed, the Company expects to be able to achieve a total hash rate capacity of approximately 4.0 Eh/s by November 2021, representing an increase of approximately 699% over the Company\u2019s estimated maximum aggregate hash rate capacity as of December 31, 2020, and an increase of approximately 3,824% over the maximum hash rate capacity the Company\u2019s former fleet of legacy model S9 miners were capable of producing.\nRelocation of Mining Operations\nDuring the first quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made the strategic decision to explore alternatives to the OKC Facility after observing elevated energy costs in operating its miners combined with atmospheric heat in Oklahoma City. After engaging in an extensive search and vetting process involving the Company\u2019s independent strategic advisory firm, XMS Capital Partners (\u201cXMS\u201d), the Company entered into a co-location mining services agreement, dated as of April 28, 2020, (the \u201cCoinmint Agreement\u201d) with Coinmint, LLC (\u201cCoinmint\u201d) to allow the Company to relocate its miners to Coinmint\u2019s cryptocurrency mining facility in Massena, New York (the \u201cCoinmint Facility\u201d).\nIndex\nDuring the second quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, and after an initial testing period, Riot completed the relocation of its cryptocurrency mining operations from the OKC Facility to the Coinmint Facility, where Coinmint provides access to electrical power and internet, as well as basic maintenance, for Riot\u2019s miners, including all 4,000 of its S17-Pro Antminers. In connection with this relocation, Riot also began selling off or otherwise salvaging for spare parts its legacy model S9 miners, which the Company\u2019s management team had made the strategic decision to take offline to accommodate its growing newer generation Antminer fleet.\nRiot relocated its mining operations to the Coinmint Facility for a number of benefits, the largest of which was to reduce overhead and take advantage of the more competitive electricity costs in the New York ISO market. Following the relocation to the Coinmint Facility, the Company\u2019s lease of the OKC Facility was allowed to terminate by its terms as of June 21, 2020.\nStrategic Opportunities\nThe Company engaged XMS to assist with evaluating strategic growth opportunities. XMS is an independent global financial services firm with expertise in M&A and strategic advisory. The Company engaged XMS to help with navigating the dynamic Bitcoin landscape and advise the Company on potential strategic transactions in bitcoin mining related operations. The Company does not have a defined timeline for any transaction and cannot provide any assurance whether or when a transaction may be announced or consummated.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has been unpredictable and unprecedented and is likely to continue to result in significant national and global economic disruption, which may adversely affect our business. Based on the Company\u2019s current assessment, however, the Company does not expect any material impact on its long-term development, its operations, or its liquidity due to the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus. However, the Company is actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, and industry.\nSummary of Mining Results\nThe following table presents additional information about our cryptocurrency mining activities in coins and amounts during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 ($ in thousands):\nQuantities (in coins)\nCryptocurrencies\nBTC\nLTC\nBCH\nAmounts\nBalance at January 1, 2019\n3,082\n-\n$\nRevenue recognized from cryptocurrencies mined\n3,477\n6,741\nMining pool operating fees\n-\n-\n-\n(135\n)\nProceeds from sale of cryptocurrencies\n(585\n)\n(3,110\n)\n(499\n)\n(3,196\n)\nPurchase of miner equipment with cryptocurrencies\n(9\n)\n-\n-\n(99\n)\nRealized gain on sale/exchange of cryptocurrencies\n-\n-\n-\nImpairment of cryptocurrencies\n-\n-\n-\n(844\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2019\n3,449\n3,839\nRevenue recognized from cryptocurrencies mined\n1,033\n-\n11,984\nMining pool operating fees\n-\n-\n-\n(146\n)\nProceeds from sale of cryptocurrencies\n(500\n)\n-\n-\n(8,298\n)\nRealized gain on sale/exchange of cryptocurrencies\n(3,470\n)\n-\n5,184\nImpairment of cryptocurrencies\n-\n-\n-\n(989\n)\nCryptocurrencies received from sale of equipment\n-\n-\nBalance at December 31, 2020\n1,078\n-\n$\n11,626\nIndex\n2020 Compared to 2019\nRevenues\nCryptocurrency mining revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaled approximately $12.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Other revenue consisted of license payments of approximately $0.1 million in each period. Revenues from cryptocurrency mining are impacted significantly by volatility in bitcoin prices, as well as increases in the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s Network Hash Rate resulting from the growth in the overall quantity and quality of miners working to solve blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain and the difficulty index associated with the secure hashing algorithm employed in solving the blocks.\nFrom early 2019 to the end of 2020 the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s Network Hash Rate increased by approximately 249% as a result of, among other factors, the increased number of miners working to solve blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain during that period, many of which make use of newer, more efficient ASIC chips that are specially designed to solve blocks using the SHA-256 set of cryptographic hash functions employed on the Bitcoin blockchain. For years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the average Network Hash Rate working on the Bitcoin blockchain was 142.74 EH/s and 98.67 EH/s, respectively. Further, the difficulty index increased over 231% in the past two fiscal years. The cumulative difficulty index increase over each of years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 43.79% and 97.67%, respectively.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $6.3 million consisted primarily of direct production costs of the mining operations, including rent and utilities and fees paid to Coinmint pursuant to the Coinmint Agreement, but excluding depreciation and amortization, which are separately stated. The cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $6.1 million. The cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as a percentage of mining revenue totaled 52.2% and 90.4%, respectively. The improvement in 2020 resulted from higher average bitcoin values for mined bitcoin and lower fixed and variable costs incurred for costs of revenue for the second half of 2020 following the relocation to the Coinmint Facility.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $10.3 million, which is an approximately $1.1 million, or a 11.9% increase, as compared to $9.2 million in the 2019 period. Compensation related expense decreased by approximately $0.6 million due primarily to staff reductions during 2019, net of severance costs and the compensation expense of $0.3 for Tess in the 2019 period, which in 2020 is no longer reported in our consolidated financial statements. Stock-based compensation increased by approximately $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared with the 2019 period due to the 2020 issuance of 1,544,359 restricted stock units and the accelerated vesting of 471,544 restricted stock units due to the resignation of a member of the Company\u2019s board. Legal fees decreased by approximately $0.6 million due to legal matters associated primarily with the fees for the class action and derivative suits and special SEC related matters being higher in the 2019 period. Audit fees decreased approximately $0.3 million due to the higher level of financial activities and the audit of internal controls over financial reporting incurred for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses in the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled approximately $4.5 million, which is an increase of approximately $4.4 million, compared to $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher average depreciable equipment levels in the year ended December 31, 2020 resulting from the Company\u2019s acquisition of 7,043 new miners, which the Company depreciates over their two-year estimated usable lives using the straight-line method.\nAsset Impairment Charges\nImpairment of long-term investments of $9.4 million recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 was recorded in connection with the impairment of our investment in Coinsquare. The Company recorded this 100% impairment as a result of the OSC Order and Settlement Agreement in which Coinsquare and certain of its executives and directors admitted to violations of Ontario securities laws and conduct contrary to the public interest in connection with their operation of the Coinsquare Market.\nImpairment charges for cryptocurrencies was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was recorded to recognize an impairment of our cryptocurrencies during the three months ended March 31, 2020.\nIndex\nAsset impairment charges of $1.5 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 and were related to $0.8 million for the impairment of our cryptocurrencies accounted for as intangible assets and $0.7 million related to our intangible assets acquired in connection with our RiotX / Logical Brokerage business.\nOther Income and Expense\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized income of approximately $1.4 million in connection with the reversal of our registration rights penalty.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized losses related to the issuance of convertible notes of approximately $6.2 million and expenses totaling $6.8 million to revalue the notes and the related warrant liability to fair value.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a gain of approximately $1.1 million on the deconsolidation of Tess, due to our reduced ownership interest from 50.2% to 8.8%. No such expense was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income and interest expense was nominal.\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was nominal. Other income was approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to a $0.4 million gain on forgiveness of our payable and interest in connection with our agreement with BMSS, and a $0.5 million gain on forgiveness of various accounts payable balances.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 we recorded a gain on the sale / exchange of cryptocurrencies of approximately $5.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019 the gain on sale of cryptocurrencies was $0.7 million.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded income tax benefits of zero and $0.1 million, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt December 31, 2020, we had working capital of approximately $233.9 million, which included cash and cash equivalents of $223.4 million. We reported a net loss of $12.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. The net loss included $12.0 million in non-cash items consisting of the impairment of our investment in Coinsquare of $9.4 million, depreciation and amortization totaling $4.5 million, stock-based compensation totaling $3.4 million, impairment to our cryptocurrencies of $1.0 million, and amortization of our right of use assets of $0.4 million, offset by a $5.2 million realized gain on the sale / exchange of cryptocurrencies, $1.4 million for the reversal of our accrual for the registration rights penalty, and amortization of our license revenue of $0.1 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company received gross proceeds of approximately $84.8 million from the sale of approximately 4.4 million shares of common stock via the 2020 ATM Offering.\nCoinmint Co-location Mining Services Agreement\nOn April 8, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Coinmint, (the \u201cCoinmint Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Coinmint agreed to provide up to approximately 9.5 MW of electrical power and to perform all maintenance necessary to operate Riot\u2019s miners deployed at the Coinmint Facility. In exchange, Coinmint is reimbursed for direct production expenses and receives a performance fee based on the net cryptocurrencies generated by Riot\u2019s miners deployed at the Coinmint Facility. The amount of electrical power supplied to Riot\u2019s miners at the Coinmint Facility has subsequently been increased to accommodate Riot\u2019s expanding miner fleet. However, no formal written amendment to the Coinmint Agreement solidifying Riot\u2019s continuing access to sufficient power to operate its expanding fleet of miners has been entered into with Coinmint. The initial term of the Coinmint Agreement was six (6) months, with automatic renewals for subsequent three (3) month terms until terminated as provided in the agreement.\nPrior Lease Agreements\nEffective November 29, 2018, Kairos entered into the second amendment to the lease agreement for the approximately 107,600 square foot warehouse located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, including improvements thereon. Subsequent amendments extended the lease term to June 30, 2020 at a monthly base rent of $190,000 per month plus electrical and utility costs based upon actual usage. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, the Company relocated its miners to the Coinmint Facility and vacated the OKC Facility. The Company\u2019s refundable lease deposit of approximately $0.7 million related to its OKC lease was fully refunded, less applicable electricity charges on July 2, 2020.\nIndex\nOn April 9, 2018, the Company entered into a commercial lease agreement (the \u201cFlorida Lease\u201d) with W-Crocker Fin Place Owner VII, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, pursuant to which the Company leased approximately 1,700 rentable square feet of office and common area space in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Pursuant to the terms of the Florida Lease, the initial term was for thirty-nine (39) months. During May 2020, an agreement was reached to terminate the Florida Lease, and the Company expensed the termination payments for the Florida Lease.\nMiners\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company entered into purchase agreements with Bitmain for the acquisition of a total of 33,646 of their model S19, S19-Pro, and S19j-Pro Antminer series of miners, to be shipped and delivered during 2020 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received 3,043 model S19 Antminers of these 33,646 new miners, all of which have been deployed at the Coinmint Facility. The remaining 30,603 of these new miners are scheduled for monthly deliveries in 2021. The purchase commitment for these new miners totals $76.1 million, including $6.6 million paid for the 3,043 miners delivered during the year ended December 31, 2020, $31.9 million paid as deposits during the same period, and the remaining $37.6 million due to be paid during the year ending December 31, 2021 according to the previously disclosed payment schedules set forth in the applicable purchase agreements.\nDuring December 2019, the Company purchased 4,000 next generation Bitmain model S17-Pro Antminers for a total purchase price of approximately $6.3 million directly from Bitmain. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company relocated all 4,000 of these miners from its former OKC Facility to the Coinmint Facility in Massena, New York.\nRevenue from Mining Operations\nFunding our operations on a go-forward basis will rely significantly on our ability to continue to mine cryptocurrency and the spot or market price of the cryptocurrency we mine. We expect to generate ongoing revenues from the production of cryptocurrencies, primarily bitcoin currency rewards, for example, in our mining facilities and our ability to liquidate bitcoin currency rewards at future values will be evaluated from time to time to generate cash for operations. Generating bitcoin currency rewards, for example, which exceed our production and overhead costs will determine our ability to report profit margins related to such mining operations, although accounting for our reported profitability is significantly complex. Furthermore, regardless of our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our cryptocurrency assets, we will need to raise additional capital in the form of equity or debt to fund our operations and pursue our business strategy.\nThe ability to raise funds as equity, debt or conversion of cryptocurrency to maintain our operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties and, even if we were successful, future equity issuances would result in dilution to our existing stockholders and any future debt or debt securities may contain covenants that limit our operations or ability to enter into certain transactions. Our ability to realize revenue through bitcoin production and successfully convert bitcoin into cash or fund overhead with bitcoin is subject to a number of risks, including regulatory, financial and business risks, many of which are beyond our control. Additionally, the value of bitcoin currency rewards has been extremely volatile recently and such volatility has recently been lower and future prices cannot be predicted.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from our bitcoin production when needed or secure additional sources of funding, it may be necessary to significantly reduce our current rate of spending or explore other strategic alternatives.\nAt-the-Market Equity Offerings\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $257.5 million (after deducting $7.3 million in commissions and expenses) from sales of 49,932,051 shares of its common stock, no par value, at a weighted average gross sales price of $5.30 per share pursuant to an At-The-Market Sales Agreement, dated effective as of May 24, 2019, as amended (the \u201c2019 ATM Sales Agreement\u201d), with its sales agent, H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC (\u201cWainwright\u201d). For a more detailed discussion of Company\u2019s At-the-Market Equity Offerings, see Note 11, Stockholders\u2019 Equity, to the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, beginning on page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company has been named a defendant in several class action and other investor related lawsuits as more fully described in Part I, Item 3., \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While the Company maintains policies of insurance, such policies may not cover all of the costs or expenses associated with responding to such matters or any liability or settlement associated with any lawsuits and are subject to significant deductible or retention amounts.\nIndex\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $11.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash was consumed from continuing operations by the net loss of $12.7 million, less non-cash items of $12.0 million, consisting of the impairment of our investment in Coinsquare of $9.4 million, depreciation and amortization totaling $4.5 million, stock-based compensation totaling $3.4 million, impairment to our cryptocurrencies of $1.0 million, and amortization of our right of use assets of $0.4 million, offset by a $5.2 million realized gain on the sale / exchange of cryptocurrencies, $1.4 million for the reversal of our accrual for the registration rights penalty, and amortization of our license revenue of $0.1 million. Cryptocurrencies increased by $11.8 million and prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased by $0.8 million, offset by, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.9 million and a decrease in our lease liability of $0.4 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $15.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash was consumed from the net loss of $20.3 million, less non-cash items of $14.7 million, including a loss on the issuance of our convertible notes, common stock and warrants of $6.2 million, the change in fair value of our convertible notes and the related warrant liability of $6.8 million, amortization of our right of use assets of $2.3 million, stock-based compensation totaling $0.7 million, impairment to our cryptocurrencies of $0.8 million, an impairment of intangible assets acquired of $0.7 million related to our decision not to pursue our Logical Brokerage business, net of deferred income tax benefit of $0.1 million, and depreciation and amortization totaling $0.1 million, offset by a $1.1 million gain recognized on the deconsolidation of Tess, a $0.9 million gain on the extinguishment of notes, interest and accounts payable, other income of approximately $0.1 million, primarily related to the amortization of our deferred revenue related to our legacy animal health business and a $0.7 million related to the gain from the sale of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies increased by $6.6 million, offset by, a decrease in our lease liability of $2.3 million and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.8 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $32.8 million, consisting of proceeds received from the sale of cryptocurrencies of $8.3 million and proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment of $0.1 million, offset by deposits on equipment of $33.1 million, and purchases of property and equipment of $8.1 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3.2 million, consisting of proceeds from the sale of cryptocurrencies of $3.2 million, offset by $5.0 million for the purchase of our next generation Bitmain S17-Pro Antminers, deposits on equipment of $1.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities were $259.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in connection with our 2019 ATM Offering of $48.0 million and $209.5 million in connection with our 2020 ATM Offering, and proceeds received from the exercise of common stock warrants of $2.9 million, offset by the repurchase of common stock to pay director and employee withholding taxes of $0.4 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities were $25.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock pursuant to General Instruction I.B.1 of Form S-3 in connection with our ATM Offering of $23.8 million, the proceeds received from the issuance of Notes and Warrants of $3.0 million in the 2019 Private Financing, offset by the repayment of the principal balance related to our agreement with BMSS of $0.9 million, net of the $0.4 million gain recorded on extinguishment of the BMSS balance.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, investments, intangible assets, stock-based compensation and business combinations.\nThe Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the accounting policies the Company has adopted. In order to get a full understanding of the Company\u2019s financial statements, one must have a clear understanding of the accounting policies employed. A summary of the Company\u2019s critical accounting policies follows:\nIndex\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe Company accounts for financial instruments under Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:\nLevel 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 - observable inputs other than Level 1, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, and model-derived prices whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable; and\nLevel 3 - assets and liabilities whose significant value drivers are unobservable.\nObservable inputs are based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company\u2019s market assumptions. Unobservable inputs require significant management judgment or estimation. In some cases, the inputs used to measure an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is required to be classified using the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Such determination requires significant management judgment. As of December 31, 2020, there were no financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company issued convertible notes and warrants in connection with the notes. The notes and warrants were classified as liabilities and measured at fair value on the issuance date, with changes in fair value recognized as other expense on the consolidated statements of operations and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.\nCryptocurrencies\nCryptocurrencies, (including bitcoin and litecoin) are included in current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The classification of cryptocurrencies as a current asset has been made after the Company\u2019s consideration of the significant consistent daily trading volume on readily available cryptocurrency exchanges, there are no limitations or restrictions on Company\u2019s ability to sell bitcoin and the pattern of actual sales of bitcoin by the Company. Cryptocurrencies purchased are recorded at cost and cryptocurrencies awarded to the Company through its mining activities are accounted for in connection with the Company\u2019s revenue recognition policy disclosed below.\nCryptocurrencies held are accounted for as intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, which is measured using the quoted price of the cryptocurrency at the time its fair value is being measured. In testing for impairment, the Company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is determined that it is not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test is not necessary. If the Company concludes otherwise, it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted.\nPurchases of cryptocurrencies by the Company are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows, while cryptocurrencies awarded to the Company through its mining activities are included within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The sales of cryptocurrencies are included within investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows and any realized gains or losses from such sales are included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company accounts for its gains or losses in accordance with the first in first out (FIFO) method of accounting.\nIndex\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nManagement reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.\nThe Company made the decision, effective as of December 31, 2019 not to pursue its RiotX / Logical Brokerage business development plan, and recorded an impairment of intangible assets acquired of approximately $0.7 million.\nNotes Payable Fair Value Option\nIn January 2019, the Company issued Senior Secured Promissory Notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d) to Oasis Capital, LLC, Harbor Gates Capital, LLC and SG3 Capital, LLC (each an \u201cInvestor\u201d and collectively, the \u201cInvestors\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $3.4 million. The Company has elected the fair value option to account for these Notes due to the complexity and number of embedded features. The fair value of the Notes is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair values were estimated utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model. Accordingly, the Company recorded these Notes at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations. As a result of applying the fair value option, direct costs and fees related to the Notes were recognized in earnings as incurred and were not deferred. The change in fair value of the Notes has been presented as change in value of convertible notes payable on the consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, all of the Notes were converted into 1,813,500 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock valued at their estimated fair value at the time of conversion totaling approximately $10.2 million.\nWarrant Liability\nThe Company issued Warrants to purchase 1,908,144 shares of its common stock in connection with the Notes issued to the Investors in January 2019, and recorded these outstanding Warrants as a liability at fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model. This liability is subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company\u2019s statements of operations. As of June 25, 2019, the Company\u2019s Notes had been converted in their entirety and the warrant liability was revalued and reclassified to equity, because the contingency was eliminated.\nLeases\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d). Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases, and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as both a right of use asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease or the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right of use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right of use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s only active office lease was its lease of its office space for its Castle Rock, Colorado headquarters (the \u201cCastle Rock Lease\u201d). The leased terms are not material and the lease is cancelable upon short notice.\nThe Company also terminated two former operating leases during the year ended December 31, 2020: (i) the lease of the OKC Facility and (ii) the Florida Lease, both of which are discussed under \u201cPrior Leases\u201d above.\nIndex\nIn calculating the right of use asset and lease liability, the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components as permitted under ASC 842. The Company excludes short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less from the new guidance as an accounting policy election and recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of the new revenue standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:\n\u00b7 Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer;\n\u00b7 Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u00b7 Step 3: Determine the transaction price;\n\u00b7 Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u00b7 Step 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nIn order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606\u2019s definition of a \u201cdistinct\u201d good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met: The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct), and the entity\u2019s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\nIf a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:\n\u2022\nVariable consideration\n\u2022\nConstraining estimates of variable consideration\n\u2022\nThe existence of a significant financing component in the contract\n\u2022\nNoncash consideration\n\u2022\nConsideration payable to a customer\nVariable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time as appropriate.\nThe Company has entered into digital asset mining pools by executing contracts with the mining pool operators to provide computing power to the mining pool. The contracts are terminable at any time by either party and the Company\u2019s enforceable right to compensation only begins when the Company provides computing power to the mining pool operator. In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a fractional share of the fixed cryptocurrency award the mining pool operator receives (less digital asset transaction fees to the mining pool operator which are recorded as a component of cost of revenues), for successfully adding a block to the blockchain. The Company\u2019s fractional share is based on the proportion of computing power the Company contributed to the mining pool operator to the total computing power contributed by all mining pool participants in solving the current algorithm.\nProviding computing power in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company\u2019s ordinary activities. The provision of providing such computing power is the only performance obligation in the Company\u2019s contracts with mining pool operators. The transaction consideration the Company receives, if any, is noncash consideration, which the Company measures at fair value on the date received, which is not materially different than the fair value at contract inception or the time the Company has earned the award from the pools. The consideration is all variable. Because it is not probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur, the consideration is constrained until the mining pool operator successfully places a block (by being the first to solve an algorithm) and the Company receives confirmation of the consideration it will receive, at which time revenue is recognized. There is no significant financing component in these transactions.\nIndex\nFair value of the cryptocurrency award received is determined using the market rate of the related cryptocurrency at the time of receipt. There is currently no specific definitive guidance under GAAP or alternative accounting framework for the accounting for cryptocurrencies recognized as revenue or held, and management has exercised significant judgment in determining the appropriate accounting treatment. In the event authoritative guidance is enacted by the FASB, the Company may be required to change its policies, which could have an effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position and results from operations.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based payment awards exchanged for services at the estimated grant date fair value of the award. Stock options issued under the Company\u2019s equity incentive plans are granted with an exercise price equal to no less than the market price of the Company\u2019s stock at the date of grant and expire up to ten years from the date of grant. These options generally vest on the grant date or over a one- year period.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management\u2019s best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u2019s judgment.\nExpected Term - The expected term of options represents the period that the Company\u2019s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding based on the simplified method, which is the half-life from vesting to the end of its contractual term.\nExpected Volatility - The Company computes stock price volatility over expected terms based on its historical common stock trading prices.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate - The Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield available on U. S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term.\nExpected Dividend - The Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common shares and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero in its valuation models.\nEffective January 1, 2017, the Company elected to account for forfeited awards as they occur, as permitted by Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-09. Ultimately, the actual expenses recognized over the vesting period will be for those shares that vested. Prior to making this election, the Company estimated a forfeiture rate for awards at 0%, as the Company did not have a significant history of forfeitures.\nEarnings (loss) per share\nBasic net earnings (loss) per share (\u201cEPS\u201d) of common stock is computed by dividing the Company\u2019s net earnings (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity. The Company excludes the unvested restricted share units (RSUs) awarded to its employees, officers, directors, and contractors under the 2019 Equity Plan from this net loss per share calculation because including them would be antidilutive.\nRecently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements\nThe Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the Company\u2019s financial reporting, the Company undertakes a review to determine the consequences of the change to its financial statements and believes that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company\u2019s financial statements properly reflect the change.\nWe have considered recently issued accounting pronouncements and do not believe the adoption of such pronouncements will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nSee Note 3 to our financial statements beginning on page of this Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nIndex",

    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nCorporate History and Overview\nSmartMetric, Inc. (\u201cSmartMetric\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a company that was incorporated pursuant to the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2002 and is engaged in the biometric technology manufacturing industry. SmartMetric has an issued patent covering technology that involves connection to networks using data cards (smart cards and EMV cards). In addition, SmartMetric holds the sole license to five issued patents covering features of its biometric fingerprint activated cards. SmartMetric\u2019s main products are a fingerprint sensor activated payments card for use in the credit and debit card industry. The SmartMetric fingerprint biometric cards have a rechargeable battery allowing for portable biometric identification and card activation prior to being presented to or inserted in, a credit or debit card reader. These cards are herein sometimes referred to as a biometric card or the SmartMetric Biometric Card.\nThe Market for Biometric Credit Cards\nEstimated Market Size\nThe estimated size of the market for biometric credit and debit cards is significant. While the company is not making any projections on the actual size of the market a number of industry figures point to the outsized market size and potential.\nAccording to EMVCo which is a credit card standards body responsible for the licensing and rules governing EMV chips used on today\u2019s credit and debit cards, more than 10 billion EMV chip cards have been issued by banks globally.\nSmartMetric contracted an independent consumer market research company to ascertain the potential consumer demand for a credit card with incorporated fingerprint biometrics. The survey was conducted in the USA and the respondents were Visa credit card users.\nThe result of the consumer research survey is as follows.\n1: Are you concerned about credit card or identity fraud?\nAnswered Yes: 80.1%\n2: Would you pay for a safer biometric secured credit card that has a built-in fingerprint reader for your protection?\nAnswered Yes: 65.5%\n3: What would you prefer to pay for a biometric fingerprint secured safer credit card?\nAnswer 1: $69.95 onetime charge for the life of the card (3 years)\t 60.2%\nAnswer 2: $8.95 per month (includes identity theft insurance)\t 39.7%\nGiven these consumer research results and given the number of credit cards issued by banks, it is a massively large potential market that SmartMetric has developed its product for.\nAll credit and debit cards that are to be issued by a Bank must be tested and approved of by the card brand network that the card is to operate on. Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Diners brands and networks all have their own individual testing and approval procedures. The card brand that SmartMetric is working with published its biometric testing procedures in March of 2021. This caused the company to make changes to its card. Adding its newly invented anti spoofing live fingerprint detection technology to its biometric card.\nThe SmartMetric Biometric Technology and Products\nSmartMetric\u2019s founder, Chaya Hendrick is the originator and inventor of various miniature biometric activated cards, including the SmartMetric biometric fingerprint activated payments card with an embedded fully functional fingerprint reader inside the card. The card is the size and thickness of a standard credit card. The SmartMetric biometric payments card provides for high level security for credit and debit cards by adding biometric authentication and activation to Europay, MasterCard and Visa (\u201cEMV\u201d) chip cards in use around the world. The SmartMetric biometric payments card has been manufactured to be totally interoperable with existing EMV chip card readers, ATMs as well as banking payments infrastructure. Using the advanced electronic miniaturization by SmartMetric to make its biometric credit/debit cards the Company has also created a multi-functional biometric building access control and logical network access card.\nSmartMetric has commenced efforts towards creating a biometric health insurance card with memory for storing a person\u2019s medical files, including medical images. This allows a person to securely take with them their private medical files inside the card when traveling away from home. For the first time, a person\u2019s complete medical files can be stored in a credit card-sized card and the information is only able to be accessed by the card holder\u2019s own fingerprint.\nSmartMetric has developed its rechargeable battery powered fingerprint reader that is of a scale that fits \u201cinside\u201d a standard credit or debit card. The cardholder has stored inside the card his or her fingerprint. To activate the card the person swipes the fingerprint sensor, the sensor is connected to an internal microprocessor that manages the fingerprint sensor, fingerprint image capture and comparison matching with the pre-stored fingerprint of the cardholder held in the internal electronic memory of the card. The card has a surface mounted EMV chip as found on EMV banking chip cards that is activated or turned on only after a card holder\u2019s fingerprint has been scanned and verified using the SmartMetric miniature \u201cin-card\u201d biometric scanner.\nThere are over ten (10) billion EMV chip cards used by banks around the world for credit cards, ATM cards and debit cards according to EMVco. SmartMetric sees this existing user base as a natural market for its advanced biometric activated card technology for the credit and debit card market. SmartMetric has established a network of card manufacturers and technology distributors to market its in-card biometric products to card issuing banks and in the case of the SmartMetric biometric security card, to businesses.\nSmartMetric has also developed a multi-function logical and physical access security card the size and thickness of a standard credit card. Utilizing the small size breakthroughs by the Company in its biometric payments card development, SmartMetric has successfully developed a biometric security card that is the size and thickness of a standard credit card that can easily fit inside a person\u2019s wallet.\nAs with the biometric payments card, the SmartMetric security card has an internal rechargeable battery that is used to power the card\u2019s internal processor used in the biometric fingerprint scan. All functions and operations of the card are subject to a valid fingerprint scan and match of the card user.\nAdditional technological advances have now been made on both the Company\u2019s biometric credit/debit card and its multifunction cyber security, building access biometric card.\nIn Card Fingerprint Matching and Verification\nThe SmartMetric Biometric card incorporates a rechargeable, lithium polymer battery. This battery is rechargeable, very thin and has been designed by SmartMetric to fit inside the SmartMetric fingerprint credit card sized card. This battery is manufactured by a third party unaffiliated with the Company to SmartMetric\u2019s specifications. This battery is embedded inside the card.\nOther components needed for manufacture of the SmartMetric Biometric Card include, but are not limited to, sensors, microchips, memory chips and processor chips. The ultra-thin circuit board developed by SmartMetric has, in total, nearly 200 active and passive components. The sources and availability of these materials are numerous, readily available and should not affect the ability of SmartMetric to meet future demand. The supply of memory processors and passive components may be interrupted at any time based on global supply/demand issues. We have not experienced component supply issues to date and the Company, as a matter of policy, has alternative component sources to mitigate and protect against supply chain issues.\nThe biometric card has been designed to offer the option of a built-in radio frequency transmitter for contactless access and identity verification. The RFID contactless chip transmission is turned on using the card users fingerprint verification.\nThe thinness form factor of many of the components, has also resulted in the Company having to develop its own process for high volume electronic assembly. The Company has also successfully overcome the challenge of developing a process of encapsulating the electronics in plastic to create the credit card sized biometric fingerprint activated card that also has an internal rechargeable battery.\nStandard credit card manufacturing utilizes machines that require high pressure and high temperature in fusing top and bottom sheets of plastic together thereby encasing any electronics inside the card. Given the complexity of the card\u2019s electronics and vulnerability to an assembly process involving high heat and high pressure, damage to the electronic circuitry was a major challenge for the Company to overcome. Research and development activities of the Company allowed the Company to achieve this ability through a trade secret process that protects the silicon and internal battery that is mounted directly onto the card\u2019s internal electronics circuit board.\nThe Security Technology Industry\nSmartMetric Biometric Multi-Function Security Card\nSmartMetric has developed a multi-function logical and physical access security card the size and thickness of a standard credit card. Utilizing the small size breakthroughs by the Company in its biometric payments card development, SmartMetric has successfully developed a biometric security card that can easily fit inside a person\u2019s wallet.\nAs with the biometric payments card, the SmartMetric security card has an internal rechargeable battery that is used to power the card\u2019s internal processor used in the biometric fingerprint scan. All functions and operations of the card are subject to a valid fingerprint scan and match of the card user.\nThe main features of the SmartMetric biometric security card are:\n1. Logical access smartcard card chip for insertion into a card reader attached to a computer or network\n2. RFID transceiver for physical access i.e. doorways, elevators, etc.\n3. Validation indicator light that glows green immediately following a fingerprint validation\n4. Rechargeable battery to power the card\n5. Size and thickness of a credit card\n6. Changeable security code on reverse of card for additional log on security\nCybersecurity and identity validation for network access control, physical building entry and secure on-the-spot identity security is now handled by the revolutionary biometric activated cyber and ID multi-function security card which has been developed by SmartMetric after over a decade of R&D.\nFrom governments to the workplace, better, stronger security is desired across the enterprise. Our new biometric multifunction security card provides a revolutionary biometric based solution that is portable, easily integrated and backward compatible to existing backend security infrastructure.\nThe new multifunction biometric security card by SmartMetric is a revolutionary leap forward in the Cyber and Access Security world according to SmartMetric.\nAccess management market is estimated to grow from USD 8.09 billion in 2016 to USD 14.82 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 12.9% between 2016 and 2021 according to a recent research report by KBV Research in a publication titled Identity & Access Management Market - Global Forecast by Marqual IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd (KBV Research) November 2016 KBV Research is a name owned by IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd.\nBiometrics\nBiometric technologies identify users by electronically capturing a specific biological or behavioral characteristic of that individual, such as a fingerprint or voice or facial feature, and creating a unique digital identifier from that characteristic. Because this process relies on largely unalterable human characteristics, positive identification can be achieved independent of any information possessed by the individual seeking authorization.\nThe process of identity authentication typically requires that a person present for comparison with one or more of the following factors:\n\u25cf Something known such as a password, PIN or mother\u2019s maiden name;\n\u25cf Something carried such as a token, card, or key; or\n\u25cf something physical such as fingerprint, voice pattern, signature motion, facial shape or other biological or behavioral characteristic.\nComparison of biological and behavioral characteristics has historically been the most reliable and accurate of the three factors but has also been the most difficult and costly to implement into a single product that can automatically verify the identity of a user accessing a computer network or the Internet. However, recent advances in biometric collection technologies (both biometric hardware products and their associated processing software) have increased the speed and accuracy and reduced the cost of implementing biometrics in commercial environments. Management believes that individuals, website operators, government organizations, and businesses will increasingly use this method of identity authentication.\nBiometrics refers to the automatic identification of a person based on his/her physiological or behavioral characteristics. This method of identification is preferred over traditional methods involving passwords and personal identification numbers (\u201cPINs\u201d) for two reasons: (i) the person to be identified is required to be physically present at the point of identification to be identification; and (ii) identification based on biometric techniques obviates the need to remember a password or carry a token. By replacing PINs, biometric techniques can potentially prevent unauthorized access to or fraudulent use of cellular phones, Biometric cards, desktop PCs, workstations and computer networks. It can be used during transactions conducted via telephone and Internet (e-commerce and e-banking). In automobiles, biometrics could replace keys-less entry devices. The SmartMetric fingerprint activated credit card that has the fingerprint encased inside the credit card has been developed to replace the less secure PIN\u2019s for credit and debit cards.\nPINs and passwords may be forgotten, may be hacked and token-based methods of identification, e.g., passports and driver\u2019s licenses, may be forged, stolen or lost. Various types of biometric systems are being used for real-time identification, with the most popular based on facial recognition and fingerprint matching. Other biometric systems utilize iris and retinal scanning, speech, facial thermograms and hand geometry. Of the biometric options available to work with a credit or debit card, fingerprint scanning is the only biometric methodology that has been successfully reduced in size to fit inside such cards.\nA biometric system is essentially a pattern recognition system, which makes a personal identification by determining the authenticity of a specific physiological or behavioral characteristic possessed by the user. An important issue in designing a practical system is to determine how an individual is identified.\nThere are two different ways to resolve a person\u2019s identity; verification and identification. Verification (Am I whom I claim I am?) involves confirming or denying a person\u2019s claimed identity. In identification, one has to establish a person\u2019s identity (Who am I?).\nAs stated above, the SmartMetric fingerprint biometric card has been designed as a credit-card sized card embedded with an integrated circuit, contact chip and biometric fingerprint sensor. The SmartMetric card has been designed to provide not only memory capacity, but also computational capability along with secure non-refutable identification of the user. We believe that the self-containment of SmartMetric\u2019s card makes it substantially resistant to attack, as it will not need to depend upon vulnerable external resources. Because of this characteristic, we expect that the SmartMetric biometric card may be used in different applications, which require strong security protection and authentication.\nThe physical structure of a card is specified by the International Standards Organization (\u201cISO\u201d). Generally, this structure is made up of three elements: (i) the plastic card, which is the most basic one and has the dimensions of 85.60mm x 53.98 x 0.80mm; (ii) an electronic circuit board inlay; and (iii) a contact chip that are embedded in the card.\nThe SmartMetric card has been designed to conform to ISO standards. The electronic circuit inlay is a part of, and not distinct from, the biometric card.\nThe communication line between the card and ATMs and other standard Smart Card reading devices is bi-directional serial transmission, which conforms to ISO standards. Card commands and input data are sent to the chip that responds with status words and output data upon the receipt of these commands and data. Information is sent in half duplex mode (transmission of data is in one direction at a time). This protocol, together with the restriction of the bit rate, is designed to prevent data attack on the card. Other data protection systems are utilized inside the card including advanced encryption.\nIn general, the size, the thickness and bend requirements for the biometric card were designed to protect the card from being spoiled physically.\nRecent Developments\nThe COVID-19 has had an impact on SmartMetric\u2019s final card production. While the delays are due to supply line disruption, the Company is confident that these delays will be short-lived based on advice from our manufacturing partners, manufacturing alternatives and alternative supply lines that are being put into place by the Company.\nSmartMetric has presented its fingerprint activated biometric card to a large global payments network and credit/debit card brand. The company has been advised that the card testing and approval requirements for this network is that the company\u2019s biometric fingerprint scanning must be able to differentiate between a live finger and a fake finger at the time of fingerprint scanning. This is to protect the card from what is called in the industry, spoofing.\nThe adopted method for this kind of anti-spoofing detection within the biometric industry is performed through intelligent software analysis done at the time of the fingerprint scan. SmartMetric has tested this methodology and was not confident in its robustness in performing the task at hand. So as to ensure the highest level of anti-spoofing capability, SmartMetric has developed its own method that it believes is far in advance to the normal standard within the biometric industry.\nSmartMetric has completed the invention of its advanced live finger detection method and is now working on its incorporation into the company\u2019s biometric card. Once this has been completed the company will then be presenting its card for testing as a biometric card to the global payments network. SmartMetric has received a license from this network to move forward with its product testing by the networks designated biometric card test laboratory.\nThe company\u2019s product is different from most other biometric cards that have been announced in that it has its own internal rechargeable battery. This is important and a must if the card is to be used at ATM\u2019s.\nOther differentiations are the now newly developed advanced anti-spoofing technology.\nVarious versions of the SmartMetric fingerprint biometric card are under development including but not limited to a version that has one time password OTP display and another that has a small display for showing the cards CVV.\nOther cards under development based on the company\u2019s biometric technology include memory cards with up to 2GB of memory. Also cards that have much larger display screens that can display such things as Q-Codes.\nThe large-scale memory fingerprint biometric protected card has potential application in the portable medical records industry as well as advanced applications in the banking and financial transaction industries.\nYears of research and development has gone into the miniaturization of the electronics at the core of the SmartMetric fingerprint biometric card. All of the design and electronic engineering has been undertaken by SmartMetric and is the owned property and trade secrets of the company.\nThe card developed by SmartMetric has its own ARM Cortex processor along with additional memory. The user\u2019s fingerprint is stored inside the cards memory and is protected by advanced very strong elliptic curve cryptography.\nGHS Equity Financing Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement\nOn March 6, 2020, the Company entered into an equity financing agreement (the \u201cEquity Financing Agreement\u201d), and a registration rights agreement (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d) with GHS Investments LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (\u201cGHS\u201d). Under the terms of the Equity Financing Agreement, GHS agreed to provide the Company with up to $4,000,000 over the course of 36 months in return for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. The 36-month period will commence upon effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-1 (the \u201cRegistration Statement\u201d) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) on August 6, 2020.\nFollowing effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the Company shall have the discretion to deliver puts to GHS and GHS will be obligated to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d) based on the investment amount specified in each put notice. The maximum amount that the Company shall be entitled to put to GHS in each put notice shall not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the average daily trading dollar volume of the Company\u2019s Common Stock during the ten (10) trading days preceding the put, so long as such amount does not exceed $500,000. Pursuant to the Equity Financing Agreement, GHS and its affiliates will not be permitted to purchase, and the Company may not put shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock to GHS that would result in GHS\u2019s beneficial ownership equaling more than 4.99% of the Company\u2019s outstanding Common Stock. The price of each put share shall be equal to eighty percent (80%) of the Market Price (as defined in the Equity Financing Agreement). Puts may be delivered by the Company to GHS until the earlier of thirty-six (36) months after the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, the date on which GHS has purchased an aggregate of $4,000,000 worth of Common Stock under the terms of the Equity Financing Agreement, or at such time that the Registration Statement is no longer in effect. Additionally, in accordance with the Equity Financing Agreement, the Company issued GHS a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $35,000 and a 9 month maturity date (the \u201cCommitment Note\u201d), with the first $20,000 of the Commitment Note deemed earned upon execution of the Equity Financing Agreement and the remaining $15,000 of the Commitment Note deemed earned upon payment by GHS of the Company\u2019s legal fees.\nThe Registration Rights Agreement provides that the Company shall (i) use its best efforts to file with the Commission the Registration Statement within 60 days of the date of the Registration Rights Agreement; and (ii) have the Registration Statement declared effective by the Commission within 30 days after the date the Registration Statement is filed with the Commission, but in no event more than 90 days after the Registration Statement is filed.\nSales and Marketing\nSmartMetric has engaged distributors and dealers in both North and South America. SmartMetric has entered into an agreement with Redsys the owner of the ADVANTIS credit and debit card chip that is used in over 1.4 Billion credit/debit cards globally. RedSys/Advantis is owned by card issuing Banks. Five hundred (500) card issuing banking organizations around the world are issuing credit and debit cards with the RedSys/ADVANTIS chip.\nSmartMetric has added the ADVANTIS credit/debit card chip onto the SmartMetric biometric card thereby allowing the existing RedSys / ADVANTIS banks already issuing credit and debit cards with their chip on board to now issue seamlessly the SmartMetric biometric credit/debit card. RedSys/ ADVANTIS have agreed to work closely with SmartMetric in promoting the SmartMetric card globally. RedSys/ADVANTIS is owned by some of the largest Banks in Europe and Latin America.\nManufacturing\nThe Company designs and develops its biometric technology. Current production capacity is approximately 250,000 cards per week that can be substantially increased over a relatively short period of time.\nSmartMetric\u2019s President & CEO in the card lamination factory.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on patents, licenses, trade secrets, trademarks, copyright registrations and non-disclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technologies and products. A number of patents are in process (Patents Pending) that cover critical aspects of the engineering and function of the SmartMetric biometric card. The founder of SmartMetric, Chaya Hendrick, is the inventor of these patents, and has provided SmartMetric with an option over biometric card related pending patents invented by her.\nSome of the most recent Patents Pending have not been disclosed on the publicly searchable USPTO database of filed for patents and remain trade secrets within the Company. Publishing of such Patents Pending will be done in due course.\nPatents\nSmartMetric biometric card is protected by five (5) USPTO issued patents. Other patents are pending. Our technology is also dependent upon unpatented trade secrets. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. In an effort to protect our trade secrets, we have a policy of requiring our employees, consultants and advisors to execute non-disclosure agreements. The principal shareholder of SmartMetric and technology inventor, Chaya Hendrick, through various corporate investment vehicles and companies also owns other technologies, patents, and has financial interest in other technology companies. Chaya Hendrick, under an executed employment agreement is not subject to any restriction on using and owning any technology, methodology, process or invention created by Chaya Hendrick.\nGovernment Regulation\nThere are currently no governmental regulations, which have any bearing on the raw materials or the manufacturing of our payments card products. United States federal departments such as the Department of Defense have rules and regulations concerning security features of smart cards used as identity or building and cyber access cards. These regulations stipulate a specific licensing and testing protocol for such cards.\nBanking Industry Self-Regulation\nThe EMV chip used in chip cards are subject to licensing and testing by the banking-controlled body called EMVco. EMVco is an acronym standing for Europay, MasterCard and Visa. These international payments card networks were the founding parties of EMVco.\nIndividual payments networks such as Visa, Mastercard, Europay, American Express, Union Pay Dinners and JCB all have their own individual licensing and testing standards and processes.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development program is focused on ongoing development of new products built on our existing biometric card. We continue to refine our technology and develop further improvements to our biometric card products. We have finalized our first biometric EMV payments card product. We have also concluded the design and electronic engineering for our soon-to-be released multi-function security and access control biometric cards. Research and development will continue as the Company continues to innovate and develop new biometric card-based products. Future biometric card-based products the Company is now working on, include but are not limited to: (a) health insurance card with stored in-card medical records; (b) national identity card; and (c) drivers\u2019 licenses.\nThe Company has developed and is continuing to develop its own embedded systems and application software that works with the SmartMetric Biometric Card. This development software and systems and ongoing electronic design and development requires the company to continue to expend time and financial resources on significant software development. Currently, the Company has electronic and software engineers working in Tel Aviv, Israel and Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nCompetition\nVarious potential competitors have announced products similar to that of SmartMetric\u2019s. It is understood that \u201cannounced\u201d is defined as a person to hold their finger on the cards fingerprint sensor while it is in a card reader. Unlike the SmartMetric biometric card that is powered from its own internal rechargeable battery, this other type of card does not allow the card to be used in most restaurants that need to take the card away from the table for processing at the checkout. It also does not allow their other type of card to be used at the vast majority of ATM\u2019s.\nEmployees\nAs of the date of this annual report, we have one full time employee, our Chief Executive Officer and President, Chaya Hendrick. We primarily use direct contract hires in administration and engineering, as is common in the information technology world. All work product developed by all of our engineers remains the intellectual property of SmartMetric. Engineers who work for SmartMetric under contract are primarily based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Some software engineering is conducted in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nCorporate History\nWe were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 18, 2002 and our principal office is located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Since our inception, we have invested a substantial portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our products. We have generated no revenues from the sale of our products and have experienced substantial net operating losses.\nWe entered into a royalty and licensing agreement with Chaya Hendrick, our CEO, which requires substantial payments by us on an annual basis and additionally in the event gross revenues are derived, which could harm our financial position.\nPursuant to a licensing and royalty agreement, entered into on September 11, 2017 by the Company and Chaya Hendrick, our founder and CEO, we received a license to certain patents related to our technologies until the expiration of such patents in exchange for the following : (i) issuance of 200,000 Series B Convertible Preferred Shares, (ii) 5% of gross revenues derived from the sale of products derived from the patents, and (iii) annual payments beginning at $50,000 per annum, increased by 100% of each previous year (offset against 5% gross revenue royalty payments). We believe these patents are instrumental our business plan and if we are unable to make such required payments under the plan, Chaya Hendrick may terminate the agreement, which may materially impact our business plan. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to meet our financial obligations under the terms of the agreement unless we are able to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities or derive revenue from some other source.\nWhere to Find More Information\nWe make our public filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all exhibits and amendments to these reports. These materials are available on the Company\u2019s website at www.smartmetric.com or on the SEC\u2019s web site, http://www.sec.gov.",
    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) is provided in addition to the accompanying financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. MD&A is organized as follows:\n\u25cf Company Overview - Discussion of our business plan and strategy in order to provide context for the remainder of MD&A.\n\u25cf Critical Accounting Policies - Accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results and forecasts.\n\u25cf Results of Operations - Analysis of our financial results comparing the year ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020.\n\u25cf Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity discussion of our financial condition and potential sources of liquidity.\nCompany Overview\nBusiness\nSmartMetric, Inc. was incorporated pursuant to the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2002. \u201cSmartMetric is a development stage company engaged in the technology industry. SmartMetric\u2019s main products are a fingerprint sensor activated payments card and security card with a finger sensor and fully functional fingerprint reader embedded inside the card. The SmartMetric biometric cards have a rechargeable battery allowing for portable biometric identification and card activation. This card is referred to as a biometric card or the SmartMetric Biometric Card.\u201d\nTo date, we have devoted a substantially all of our efforts and financial resources to the development of our SmartMetric Card. Since our inception in 2002, we have generated no revenue from product sales and have funded our operations principally through the private sales of our equity securities. We have never been profitable and, as of June 30, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $28,878,841. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development of our technologies and advance them to market.\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance at June 30, 2021 was approximately $10,325 representing 20.5% of total assets. Notwithstanding our recent capital raises, based on our current expected level of operating expenditures, we expect to be able to fund our operations into the quarter beginning April 1, 2022. This period could be shortened if there are any significant increases in spending that were not anticipated or other unforeseen events.\nWe anticipate raising additional cash through the private or public sales of equity or debt securities to continue to fund our operations and the development of our technologies. There is no assurance that financing will be available to us when needed in order to allow us to continue our operations, or if available, on terms acceptable to us. If we do not raise sufficient funds in a timely manner, we may be forced to curtail operations, delay or stop our ongoing clinical trials, cease operations altogether, or file for bankruptcy. We currently do not have commitments for future funding from any source.\nGoing Concern\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the carrying amounts of recorded assets or the carrying amounts and classification of recorded liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nAs shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the Company has incurred recurring losses of $944,203 and $805,577 for the period ending June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and has incurred a cumulative loss of $28,878,841 since inception (December 18, 2002). These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of this filing. The Company is currently in the development stage and has spent a substantial portion of its time in the development of its technology.\nThere is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise enough capital or generate revenues to sustain its operations.\nManagement believes that the Company\u2019s capital requirements will depend on many factors. These factors include the final phase of development and mass production being successful as well as product implementation and distribution. Management plans to continue its relationship with Geneva Roth Remark in order to raise capital beyond exclusively private placement stock sales.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the carrying amounts of recorded assets or the carrying amounts and classification of recorded liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) and has since spread worldwide, including to the Unites States, posing public health risks that have reached pandemic proportions (the \u201cCOVID-19 Pandemic\u201d). The COVID-19 Pandemic poses a threat to the health and economic wellbeing of our employees, customers and vendors. Like most businesses world-wide, the COVID-19 Pandemic has impacted the Company financially; however, management cannot presently predict the scope and severity with which COVID-19 will impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. We base these significant judgments and estimates on historical experience and other applicable assumptions we believe to be reasonable based upon information presently available. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known. Actual results could materially differ from our estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.\nAll of the Company\u2019s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our financial statements, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. We have identified the following as our significant accounting policies and estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements:\nUse of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying disclosures. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nResearch and Development Costs - Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of expenditures for electronics design and engineering, software design and engineering, component sourcing, component engineering, manufacturing, product trials, compensation and consulting costs.\nEarnings Per Share - In accordance with FASB ASC 260, \u201cEarnings Per Share,\u201d the basic loss per share is computed by dividing the loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Basic net loss per share excludes the dilutive effect of stock options or warrants and convertible notes. Diluted net earnings (loss) per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents, consisting of shares that might be issued upon exercise of common stock options and warrants. In periods where losses are reported, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\nPatent Impairment - When the carrying balance of the Company\u2019s patent is more than what it could be sold for on the open market and/or is not recoverable through future use, the Company decreases its value. In determining whether the carrying value is not recoverable, the Company estimates the sum of the expected cash flows from the use of the patent or its possible sale. If the results in an amount less that the patent\u2019s value on the financial statements, the Company will deem the patent\u2019s carrying value on the balance sheet to be impaired by the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the asset. The decrease in the patent\u2019s value will then be included as a loss in the Company\u2019s profit and loss statement. The Company had no patent asset recorded at June 30, 2021.\nCash - The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments and other short-term investments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Any amounts of cash in financial institutions which exceed FDIC insured limits exposes the Company to cash concentration risk. The Company had no cash equivalents at June 30, 2021 and 2020.\nResult of Operations\nYear Ended June 30, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended June 30, 2020\nOur results of operations have varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and may vary significantly in the future. We did not have revenue during the years ending June 30, 2021 and 2020. We did not generate any revenues during the years ending June 30, 2021 and 2020. Net loss for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $944,203 and $805,577, respectively, resulting from the operational activities described below.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $821,824 and $747,478 during the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in operating expenses is the result of the following factors.\nYear Ended\nJune 30, Change in 2021\nVersus 2020\n$ %\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development $ 76,344 $ 89,240 $ (12,896 ) (14.5 )%\nGeneral and administrative 555,480 468,238 87,242 18.6 %\nOfficer salary 190,000 190,000 - (0 )%\nTotal operating expense $ 821,824 $ 747,478 $ 74,346 9.9 %\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses were 76,344 and $89,240 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease of $12,896, or 14.5%, in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily attributable to a decrease in engineering costs.\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of expenditures related to engineering.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $555,480 and $468,238 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of $87,242 or 18.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily the result of an increase in consulting expenses.\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenditures related to employee compensation, legal, accounting and tax, other professional services, and general operating expenses.\nOfficer salary were $190,000 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe have incurred losses since our inception in 2002 as a result of significant expenditures for operations and research and development and the lack of any revenue. We have an accumulated deficit of approximately $28.9 million as of June 30, 2021 and anticipate that we will continue to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. Through June 30, 2021, we have funded our operations through the private sale of our equity securities and exercise of options and warrants, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $27 million. Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2021 were $10,325.\nWe are actively seeking sources of financing to fund our continued operations and research and development programs. To raise additional capital, we may sell shares of equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any financing transaction in a timely manner or on acceptable terms or otherwise. If we are not able to raise additional cash, we may be forced to further delay, curtail, or cease development of our product candidates, or cease operations altogether.\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nCash at beginning of period\n$ 71,377\n$ 10,161\nNet cash used in operating activities\n(567,582 )\n(744,003 )\nNet cash used in investing activities\n-\n-\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n506,530\n805,219\nCash at end of period\n$ 10,325\n$ 71,377\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $567,582 and $744,003 for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease of $135,078 in cash used during 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily attributable to lower consulting and legal expenses.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $0 and $0 for years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $506,530 for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to $805,219 for the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease of $257,346 was due to decreased private placement sales. We are actively seeking sources of financing to fund our continued operations and research and development programs.",

While we instituted a global work-from-home policy beginning in March 2020, which has been modified to provide employees with the choice to work in certain of our offices when and as they feel comfortable, we did not incur significant disruptions in our work operations during fiscal 2021. We are conducting business as usual with restrictions to employee travel, and we have transitioned in-person marketing events to virtual formats, among other modifications. We expect these changes will substantially remain in effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and could extend to future quarters. We will continue to actively monitor the situation, including progress made through vaccinations, and we will make further changes to our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities and that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders. Our focus remains on the safety of our employees, and we strive to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, in part, by providing technology to our employees, end-customers, and partners to help them do their best work while remote.\nAlthough some end-customers adopted Prisma Access as their secure work-from-home solution for the longer term, COVID-19\n- 4 -\nhas affected our end-customers\u2019 spending and could lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions, and lengthen sales cycles and payment terms, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and overall financial performance. Also, certain of our end-customers or partners may be or may become credit or cash constrained, making it difficult for them to fulfill their payment obligations to us. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on developments, including the duration and spread of the virus and its variants, impact on our end-customers\u2019 spending, volume of sales and length of our sales cycles, impact on our partners, suppliers, and employees, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and other factors identified in Part I,",

Unit 42 offers incident response, risk management, board advisory and proactive cybersecurity assessment services.\nFor fiscal 2021 and 2020, total revenue was $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 24.9%. Our growth reflects the increased adoption of our portfolio, which consists of product, subscriptions, and support. We believe our portfolio will enable us to benefit from recurring revenues as we continue to grow our installed end-customer base. As of July 31, 2021, we had end-customers in over 170 countries. Our end-customers represent a broad range of industries including education, energy, financial services, government entities, healthcare, Internet and media, manufacturing, public sector, and telecommunications, and include some of the largest Fortune 100 and Global 2000 companies in the world. We maintain a field sales force that works closely with our channel partners in developing sales opportunities. We primarily use a two-tiered, indirect fulfillment model whereby we sell our products, subscriptions, and support to our distributors, which, in turn, sell to our resellers, which then sell to our end-customers.\nOur product revenue was $1.1 billion or 26.3% of total revenue for fiscal 2021, representing year-over-year growth of 5.3%. Product revenue is generated from sales of our appliances, primarily our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall, which is available in a number of form factors, including as physical, virtual, and containerized appliances. Our ML-Powered Next-Generation Firewall incorporates our PAN-OS operating system, which provides a consistent set of capabilities across our entire network security product line. Our products are designed for different performance requirements throughout an organization, ranging from our PA-410, which is designed for small organizations and remote or branch offices, to our top-of-the-line PA-7080, which is designed for large-scale data centers and service provider use. The same firewall functionality that is delivered in our physical appliances is also available in our VM-Series virtual firewalls, which secure virtualized and cloud-based computing environments, and in our CN-Series container firewalls, which secure container environments and traffic.\nOur subscription and support revenue grew to $3.1 billion or 73.7% of total revenue for fiscal 2021, representing year-over-year growth of 33.8%. Our subscriptions provide our end-customers with near real-time access to the latest antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, modern malware prevention, data loss prevention, and cloud access security broker capabilities across the network, endpoints, and the cloud. When end-customers purchase our physical, virtual, or container firewall appliances, or certain cloud offerings, they typically purchase support in order to receive ongoing security updates, upgrades, bug fixes, and repairs. In addition to the subscriptions purchased with these appliances, end-customers may also purchase other subscriptions on a per-user, per-endpoint, or capacity-based basis. We also offer professional services, including incident response, risk management, and digital forensic services.\nWe continue to invest in innovation and acquire businesses as we evolve and further extend the capabilities of our portfolio, as we believe that innovation and timely development of new features and products is essential to meeting the needs of our end-customers and improving our competitive position. During fiscal 2021, we introduced several new offerings, including: Cortex XDR 2.5, Next Generation SD-WAN, Prisma Cloud 2.0, Enterprise DLP, 5G Security, IoT Healthcare Security, Prisma Access 2.0 and Complete Zero Trust Network Security. Additionally, we acquired productive investments that we believe fit well within our long-term strategy. For example, in September 2020, we acquired Crypsis, which we expect will expand our incident response capabilities and strengthen our Cortex strategy; in November 2020, we acquired Sinefa, which we expect will extend our Prisma Access offering; in December 2020, we acquired Expanse, which we expect will enrich our Cortex offerings and provide organizations an integrated view of the enterprise to combine external, internal, and threat data; and in March 2021, we acquired Bridgecrew, which we expect will expand our Prisma Cloud offering to deliver security across the full application lifecycle.\nWe believe that the growth of our business and our short-term and long-term success are dependent upon many factors, including our ability to extend our technology leadership, grow our base of end-customers, expand deployment of our portfolio and support offerings within existing end-customers, and focus on end-customer satisfaction. To manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative\n- 44 -\nsystems and controls, and our ability to manage headcount, capital, and processes in an efficient manner. While these areas present significant opportunities for us, they also pose challenges and risks that we must successfully address in order to sustain the growth of our business and improve our operating results. For additional information regarding the challenges and risks we face, see the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nImpact of COVID-19 on Our Business\nWe are actively monitoring, evaluating, and responding to developments relating to COVID-19, which has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in continued significant global, social, and business disruption. As described in \u201cImpacts of COVID-19 on our Business\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 Business in this Annual Report, we have made some changes to our business including instituting a global work-from-home policy beginning in March 2020 and adopting our FLEXWORK initiative in fiscal 2021, which did not incur significant disruptions in our work operations during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021. We will continue to actively monitor the situation, including progress made through vaccinations, and we will make further changes to our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, end-customers, partners, suppliers, and stockholders. Our focus remains on the safety of our employees, and we strive to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, in part, by providing technology to our employees, end-customers, and partners to help them do their best work while remote.\nAlthough some end-customers adopted Prisma Access as their secure work-from-home solution for the longer term, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the business outlook due to COVID-19, which may curtail our end-customers\u2019 spending and could lead them to delay or defer purchasing decisions, and lengthen sales cycles and payment terms, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, and overall financial performance. Also, certain of our end-customers or partners may be or may become credit or cash constrained, making it difficult for them to fulfill their payment obligations to us. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on developments, including the duration and spread of the virus (including variants), impact on our end-customers\u2019 spending, volume of sales and length of our sales cycles, impact on our partners, suppliers, and employees, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the full impact of COVID-19 on our ongoing business, results of operations, and overall financial performance cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nKey Financial Metrics\nWe monitor the key financial metrics set forth in the tables below to help us evaluate growth trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and assess operational efficiencies. We discuss revenue, gross margin, and the components of operating loss and margin below under \u201cResults of Operations.\u201d\nJuly 31,\n2021 2020\n(in millions)\nTotal deferred revenue $ 5,024.0 $ 3,810.2\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments $ 3,789.4 $ 4,302.2\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(dollars in millions)\nTotal revenue $ 4,256.1 $ 3,408.4 $ 2,899.6\nTotal revenue year-over-year percentage increase 24.9 % 17.5 % 27.5 %\nGross margin 70.0 % 70.7 % 72.1 %\nOperating loss $ (304.1) $ (179.0) $ (54.1)\nOperating margin (7.1) % (5.3) % (1.9) %\nBillings $ 5,452.2 $ 4,301.7 $ 3,489.8\nBillings year-over-year percentage increase 26.7 % 23.3 % 22.2 %\nCash flow provided by operating activities $ 1,503.0 $ 1,035.7 $ 1,055.6\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 1,387.0 $ 821.3 $ 924.4\n\u2022Deferred Revenue. Our deferred revenue primarily consists of amounts that have been invoiced but have not been recognized as revenue as of the period end. The majority of our deferred revenue balance consists of subscription and support revenue that is recognized ratably over the contractual service period. We monitor our deferred revenue balance because it represents a significant portion of revenue to be recognized in future periods.\n- 45 -\n\u2022Billings. We define billings as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during the period. We consider billings to be a key metric used by management to manage our business. We believe billings provides investors with an important indicator of the health and visibility of our business because it includes subscription and support revenue, which is recognized ratably over the contractual service period, and product revenue, which is recognized at the time of shipment, provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors, particularly if we continue to experience increased sales of subscriptions and strong renewal rates for subscription and support offerings, and as we monitor our near-term cash flows. While we believe that billings provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure. We calculate billings in the following manner:\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(in millions)\nBillings:\nTotal revenue $ 4,256.1 $ 3,408.4 $ 2,899.6\nAdd: change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue 1,196.1 893.3 590.2\nBillings $ 5,452.2 $ 4,301.7 $ 3,489.8\n\u2022 Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities. We monitor cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of our overall business performance. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is driven in large part by sales of our products and from up-front payments for subscription and support offerings. Monitoring cash flow provided by operating activities enables us to analyze our financial performance without the non-cash effects of certain items such as depreciation, amortization, and share-based compensation costs, thereby allowing us to better understand and manage the cash needs of our business.\n\u2022 Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP). We define free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, equipment, and other assets. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of our financial performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, it is important to note that other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use free cash flow, may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a comparative measure. A reconciliation of free cash flow to cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, is provided below:\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(in millions)\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP):\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 1,503.0 $ 1,035.7 $ 1,055.6\nLess: purchases of property, equipment, and other assets 116.0 214.4 131.2\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 1,387.0 $ 821.3 $ 924.4\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (1,480.6) $ 288.0 $ (1,825.9)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (1,104.0) $ 673.0 $ (773.9)\n- 46 -\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods based on our consolidated statements of operations data.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the corresponding promised products and subscriptions and support to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products and subscriptions and support. We expect our revenue to vary from quarter to quarter based on seasonal and cyclical factors.\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue is derived primarily from sales of our appliances. Product revenue also includes revenue derived from software licenses of Panorama and the VM-Series. Our appliances and software licenses include a broad set of built-in networking and security features and functionalities. We recognize product revenue at the time of hardware shipment or delivery of software license.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nProduct $ 1,120.3 $ 1,064.2 $ 56.1 5.3 % $ 1,064.2 $ 1,096.2 $ (32.0) (2.9) %\nProduct revenue increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, largely driven by increases in software sales, reflecting increased demand for our products.\nSubscription and Support Revenue\nSubscription and support revenue is derived primarily from sales of our subscription and support offerings. Our contractual subscription and support contracts are typically one to five years. We recognize revenue from subscriptions and support over time as the services are performed. As a percentage of total revenue, we expect our subscription and support revenue to vary from quarter to quarter and increase over the long term as we introduce new subscriptions, renew existing subscription and support contracts, and expand our installed end-customer base.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nSubscription $ 1,898.8 $ 1,405.3 $ 493.5 35.1 % $ 1,405.3 $ 1,032.7 $ 372.6 36.1 %\nSupport 1,237.0 938.9 298.1 31.7 % 938.9 770.7 168.2 21.8 %\nTotal subscription and support $ 3,135.8 $ 2,344.2 $ 791.6 33.8 % $ 2,344.2 $ 1,803.4 $ 540.8 30.0 %\nSubscription and support revenue increased year-over-year for fiscal 2021 due to increased demand for our subscription and support offerings from both new and existing end-customers. The mix between subscription revenue and support revenue will vary over time, depending on the introduction of new subscription offerings, renewals of support services, and our ability to increase sales to new and existing end-customers.\nRevenue by Geographic Theater\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nAmericas $ 2,937.5 $ 2,318.0 $ 619.5 26.7 % $ 2,318.0 $ 1,977.0 $ 341.0 17.2 %\nEMEA 817.3 671.9 145.4 21.6 % 671.9 568.6 103.3 18.2 %\nAPAC 501.3 418.5 82.8 19.8 % 418.5 354.0 64.5 18.2 %\nTotal revenue\n$ 4,256.1 $ 3,408.4 $ 847.7 24.9 % $ 3,408.4 $ 2,899.6 $ 508.8 17.5 %\nWith respect to geographic theaters, the Americas contributed the largest portion of the year-over-year increases in revenue for fiscal 2021 due to its larger and more established sales force compared to our other theaters. Revenue from both Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (\u201cEMEA\u201d) and Asia Pacific and Japan (\u201cAPAC\u201d) increased year-over-year for fiscal 2021 due to our increasing investment in global sales force in order to support our growth and innovation.\n- 48 -\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists of cost of product revenue and cost of subscription and support revenue.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue primarily includes costs paid to our manufacturing partners. Our cost of product revenue also includes personnel costs, which consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, and travel and entertainment associated with our operations organization, amortization of intellectual property licenses, product testing costs, shipping and tariff costs, and allocated costs. Allocated costs consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect our cost of product revenue to fluctuate with our product revenue.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nCost of product revenue $ 308.5 $ 294.4 $ 14.1 4.8 % $ 294.4 $ 315.9 $ (21.5) (6.8) %\nNumber of employees at period end 127 117 10 8.5 % 117 102 15 14.7 %\nCost of product revenue increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to an increase in the volume of product sold, partially offset by product mix. The remaining increase was largely due to increased overhead costs to support the growth of our product revenue.\nCost of Subscription and Support Revenue\nCost of subscription and support revenue includes personnel costs for our global customer support and technical operations organizations, customer support and repair costs, third-party professional services costs, data center and cloud hosting service costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets and capitalized software development costs, and allocated costs. We expect our cost of subscription and support revenue to increase as our installed end-customer base grows and adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings increases.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nCost of subscription and support revenue $ 966.4 $ 705.1 $ 261.3 37.1 % $ 705.1 $ 492.5 $ 212.6 43.2 %\nNumber of employees at period end 2,108 1,402 706 50.4 % 1,402 1,219 183 15.0 %\nCost of subscription and support revenue increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to increased costs to support the growth of our subscription and support offerings. Personnel costs grew $97.1 million to $412.4 million for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to headcount growth. Cloud hosting service costs, which support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings increased $45.6 million for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The remaining increase was primarily due to increased outside service costs for global customer support resulting from the expansions of our customer base and product portfolio, as well as the amortization of intangible assets from our recent acquisitions.\nGross Margin\nGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the introduction of new products, manufacturing costs, tariff costs, the average sales price of our products, cloud hosting service costs, personnel costs, the mix of products sold, and the mix of revenue between product and subscription and support offerings. For sales of our products, our higher-end firewall products generally have higher gross margins than our lower-end firewall products within each product series. We expect our gross margins to vary over time depending on the factors described above.\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nAmount Gross\nMargin Amount Gross\nMargin Amount Gross\nMargin\n(dollars in millions)\nProduct $ 811.8 72.5 % $ 769.8 72.3 % $ 780.3 71.2 %\nSubscription and support 2,169.4 69.2 % 1,639.1 69.9 % 1,310.9 72.7 %\nTotal gross profit\n$ 2,981.2 70.0 % $ 2,408.9 70.7 % $ 2,091.2 72.1 %\n- 49 -\nProduct gross margin was relatively flat for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nSubscription and support gross margin decreased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to increased costs to fulfill professional services arrangements.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment, and with regard to sales and marketing expense, sales commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs, which consist of certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs that we allocate based on headcount. We expect operating expenses generally to increase in absolute dollars and decrease over the long term as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our business. In response to COVID-19, we instituted a global work-from-home policy, which has been modified to provide employees with the choice to work in certain of our offices when and as they feel comfortable, and limited employee travel beginning in March 2020. Further, we have canceled in-person events and either replaced them with virtual events or postponed them to future periods. As of July 31, 2021, we expect to recognize approximately $2.0 billion of share-based compensation expense over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.6 years, excluding additional share-based compensation expense related to any future grants of share-based awards. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs. Research and development expense also includes prototype related expenses and allocated costs. We expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our future products and services, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nResearch and development $ 1,140.4 $ 768.1 $ 372.3 48.5 % $ 768.1 $ 539.5 $ 228.6 42.4 %\nNumber of employees at period end 2,595 1,821 774 42.5 % 1,821 1,507 314 20.8 %\nResearch and development expense increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to an increase in personnel costs, which grew $321.2 million to $911.0 million for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in personnel costs was primarily due to headcount growth.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including commission expense. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs for market development programs, promotional and other marketing costs, professional services, and allocated costs. We continue to thoughtfully invest in headcount and have substantially grown our international sales presence. We expect sales and marketing expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our sales and marketing organizations to increase touch points with end-customers and to expand our global presence, although our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nSales and marketing $ 1,753.8 $ 1,520.2 $ 233.6 15.4 % $ 1,520.2 $ 1,344.0 $ 176.2 13.1 %\nNumber of employees at period end 4,493 3,800 693 18.2 % 3,800 3,382 418 12.4 %\nSales and marketing expense increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, which grew $186.9 million to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020. The increase in personnel costs was largely due to headcount growth, partially offset by decreased travel expenses due to COVID-19. In addition, expenses increased as a result of go-to-market initiatives, including advertising, which were partially offset by a decrease in trade shows and convention expenses as in-person events were replaced with virtual events due to COVID-19.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our executive, finance, human resources, legal, and information technology organizations, and professional services costs, which consist primarily of legal, auditing, accounting, and other\n- 50 -\nconsulting costs. General and administrative expense also includes certain non-recurring general expenses and impairment losses. Certain facilities, depreciation, benefits, recruiting, and information technology costs are allocated to other organizations based on headcount. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, and insurance, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nGeneral and administrative $ 391.1 $ 299.6 $ 91.5 30.5 % $ 299.6 $ 261.8 $ 37.8 14.4 %\nNumber of employees at period end 1,150 874 276 31.6 % 874 804 70 8.7 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to personnel costs, which grew $48.9 million to $244.0 million for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, due primarily to an increase in share-based compensation expense related to accelerated vesting of certain equity awards in connection with our acquisitions and headcount growth. Other increases included increased professional services expense to support our business growth.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of non-cash interest expense from the amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs related to our 0.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the \u201c2019 Notes\u201d), the 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d) and the 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d, and together with \u201c2023 Notes\u201d, the \u201cNotes\u201d), and also includes the contractual interest expense related to our Notes.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nInterest expense $ 163.3 $ 88.7 $ 74.6 84.1 % $ 88.7 $ 83.9 $ 4.8 5.7 %\nInterest expense increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to the issuance of our 2025 Notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our series of convertible senior notes.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net includes interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments, foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nOther income, net $ 2.4 $ 35.9 $ (33.5) (93.3) % $ 35.9 $ 63.4 $ (27.5) (43.4) %\nOther income, net decreased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalent, and investment balances as a result of lower interest rates for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and withholding taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance for domestic and certain foreign deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards and certain domestic tax credits. In recent years, we reorganized our corporate structure and intercompany relationships to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. Our corporate structure has caused, and may continue to cause, disproportionate relationships between our overall effective tax rate and other jurisdictional measures. To the extent\n- 51 -\nwe revisit our corporate structure, it may have an impact on our tax provision.\nYear Ended July 31, Year Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change 2020 2019 Change\nAmount Amount Amount % Amount Amount Amount %\n(dollars in millions)\nProvision for income taxes $ 33.9 $ 35.2 $ (1.3) (3.7) % $ 35.2 $ 7.3 $ 27.9 382.2 %\nEffective tax rate (7.3) % (15.2) % (15.2) % (9.8) %\nWe recorded an income tax provision for fiscal 2021. The provision for income taxes for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to income taxes in profitable foreign jurisdictions and withholding taxes. Our provision for income taxes slightly decreased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to changes in our valuation allowances. Refer to Note 15. Income Taxes in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\n- 52 -\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nJuly 31,\n2021 2020\n(in millions)\nWorking capital $ (469.4) $ 2,437.5\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,874.2 $ 2,958.0\nInvestments 1,915.2 1,344.2\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and investments $ 3,789.4 $ 4,302.2\nAs of July 31, 2021, our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $3.8 billion were held for general corporate purposes, of which approximately $942.3 million was held outside of the United States. As of July 31, 2021, we had no unremitted earnings when evaluating our outside basis difference relating to our U.S. investment in foreign subsidiaries. However, there could be local withholding taxes payable due to various foreign countries if certain lower tier earnings are distributed. Withholding taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these lower tier earnings are not expected to be material.\nIn June 2014, we issued the 2019 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million. The 2019 Notes were converted prior to or settled on the maturity date of July 1, 2019. During fiscal 2019, we repaid in cash $575.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes and issued 2.5 million shares of common stock to the holders for the conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the 2019 Notes converted, which were fully offset by shares received from our exercise of the associated note hedges. In July 2018, we issued the 2023 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1.7 billion. In June 2020, we issued the 2025 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $2.0 billion. The 2023 Notes mature on July 1, 2023 and the 2025 Notes mature on June 1, 2025; however, under certain circumstances, holders may surrender their Notes of a series for conversion prior to the applicable maturity date. Upon conversion of the Notes of a series, we will pay cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series to be converted, and, at our election, will pay or deliver cash and/or shares of our common stock for the amount of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series being converted. The sale price condition was met for the 2023 Notes during the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2021, and as a result, holders may convert their 2023 Notes at any time during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2021. We believe that our cash provided by operating activities, together with our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs should the holders choose to convert their 2023 Notes during the fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2021. As of July 31, 2021, substantially all of our 2023 Notes and 2025 Notes remained outstanding. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Notes.\nIn September 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) that provides for a $400.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), with an option to increase the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional $350.0 million, subject to certain conditions. As of July 31, 2021, there were no amounts outstanding, and we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. Refer to Note 10. Debt in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the Credit Agreement.\nIn February 2019, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share repurchase program, and, in December 2020, our board of directors authorized a $700.0 million increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to $1.7 billion (our \u201ccurrent authorization\u201d). As of July 31, 2021, $323.9 million remained available for future share repurchases under this current authorization. On August 17, 2021, our board of directors authorized another $676.1 million increase to our current authorization, bringing the total remaining authorization for future share repurchases to $1.0 billion. Repurchases will be funded from available working capital and may be made at management\u2019s discretion from time to time. The expiration date of our current authorization was extended to December 31, 2022, and this program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In February 2020, our board of directors approved the repurchase of $1.0 billion of our common stock through an accelerated share repurchase (\u201cASR\u201d) transaction, which was in addition to our current authorization. During fiscal 2020, we completed the ASR transaction with an aggregate of 5.2 million shares of our common stock repurchased and retired. Refer to Note 13. Stockholders\u2019 Equity in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on these repurchase programs.\n- 53 -\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nYear Ended July 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(in millions)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 1,503.0 $ 1,035.7 $ 1,055.6\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities (1,480.6) 288.0 (1,825.9)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,104.0) 673.0 (773.9)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (1,081.6) $ 1,996.7 $ (1,544.2)\nCash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of COVID-19 and other risks detailed in Part I, Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K. We believe that our cash flow from operations with existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and subscription and support offerings, the costs to acquire or invest in complementary businesses and technologies, the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the investments in our infrastructure to support the adoption of our cloud-based subscription offerings, the investments in our new corporate headquarters, the continuing market acceptance of our products and subscription and support offerings and macroeconomic events such as COVID-19. In addition, from time to time we may incur additional tax liability in connection with certain corporate structuring decisions.\nWe may also choose to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOperating Activities\nOur operating activities have consisted of net losses adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.\nCash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 was $1.5 billion, an increase of $467.3 million compared to fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to growth of our business as reflected by an increase in billings, and an increase in collections during fiscal 2021, partially offset by higher cash expenditure to support our business growth.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and business acquisitions. We expect to continue such activities as our business grows.\nCash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was $1.5 billion, a net change of $1.8 billion compared to cash provided by investing activities of $288.0 million in fiscal 2020. The change was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and higher purchases of investments during fiscal 2021.\nFinancing Activities\nOur financing activities have consisted of proceeds from sales of shares through employee equity incentive plans, cash used to repurchase shares of our common stock, and payments for tax withholding obligations of certain employees related to the net share settlement of equity awards.\nCash used in financing activities during fiscal 2021 was $1.1 billion, a net change of $1.8 billion compared to cash provided by financing activities of 673.0 million in fiscal 2020. The change was primarily due to net proceeds of $1.8 billion from the issuance of our 2025 Notes, issuance of warrants, and purchase of note hedges during fiscal 2020.\n- 54 -\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of July 31, 2021:\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More Than 5 Years\n(in millions)\n0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023\n$ 1,692.0 $ - $ 1,692.0 $ - $ -\n0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025\n2,000.0 - - 2,000.0 -\nOperating lease obligations\n426.6 78.8 134.2 116.1 97.5\nPurchase obligations(1)\n1,831.7 251.3 609.0 971.4 -\nTotal(2)\n$ 5,950.3 $ 330.1 $ 2,435.2 $ 3,087.5 $ 97.5\n______________\n(1) Consists of minimum purchase commitments of products and components with our manufacturing partners and component suppliers, as well as minimum or fixed purchase commitments for our use of certain cloud and other services with third-party providers. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.\n(2) No amounts related to income taxes are included. As of July 31, 2021, we had approximately $80.6 million of tax liabilities recorded related to uncertainty in income tax positions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of July 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the global impact of COVID-19. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies described in Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our contracts with our customers include various combinations of our products and subscriptions and support. Our appliances and software licenses have significant standalone functionalities and capabilities and, accordingly, are distinct from our subscriptions and support services, as the customer can benefit from the product without these services and such services are separately identifiable within the contract. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract. The amount we are due in exchange for delivering on the contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.\nWe establish standalone selling price using the prices charged for a deliverable when sold separately. If not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price based on our pricing model and our go-to-market strategy, which include factors such as type of sales channel (reseller, distributor, or end-customer), the geographies in which our offerings were sold (domestic or international) and offering type (products, subscriptions, or support). As our business offerings evolve over time, we may be required to modify our estimated standalone selling prices, and as a result the timing and classification of our revenue could be affected.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nWe defer contract costs that are recoverable and incremental to obtaining customer sales contracts. Contract costs, which primarily consist of sales commissions, are amortized on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are not commensurate with renewal\n- 55 -\ncommissions are amortized over a benefit period of five years, consistent with the revenue recognition pattern of the performance obligations in the related contracts including expected renewals. The benefit period is determined by taking into consideration contract length, technology life, and other quantitative and qualitative factors. The expected renewals are estimated based on historical renewal trends. Sales commissions for initial contracts that are commensurate and sales commissions for renewal contracts are amortized over the related contractual period in proportion to the revenue recognized.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nWe apply the authoritative accounting guidance prescribing a threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.\nSignificant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences may impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nManufacturing Partner and Supplier Liabilities\nWe outsource most of our manufacturing, repair, and supply chain management operations to our EMS provider, which procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts of future demand are based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. We accrue for costs for manufacturing purchase commitments in excess of our forecasted demand, including costs for excess components or for carrying costs incurred by our manufacturing partners and component suppliers. Actual component usage and product demand may be materially different from our forecast and could be caused by factors outside of our control, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To date, we have not accrued significant costs associated with this exposure.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and the range of the loss can be reasonably determined, then we disclose the range of the possible loss. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual is required, an accrual should be adjusted, or a range of possible loss should be disclosed.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. However, there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation, and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur substantial settlement charges, which are inherently difficult to estimate and could adversely affect our results of operations. The actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses.\nGoodwill, Intangibles, and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments when valuing goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity, as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets on an ongoing basis. These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information obtained from the management of the acquired company. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, discount rates, the time and expense that would be necessary to recreate the assets, and the profit margin a market participant would receive. The amounts and useful lives assigned to identified intangible assets impacts the amount and timing of future amortization expense.\n- 56 -\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if we believe impairment indicators exist. We have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment includes our evaluation of relevant events and circumstances affecting our single reporting unit, including macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, our overall financial performance, and trends in the market price of our common stock. If qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that our reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying amount, then we will perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing our reporting unit\u2019s carrying amount, including goodwill, to its fair value. If the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess. To date, the results of our qualitative assessment have indicated that the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not necessary.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying asset or asset group, a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired assets, difficulty and delays in integrating the business, or a significant change in the operations of the acquired assets or use of an asset or asset group. A long-lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. Critical estimates in determining whether a long-lived asset is considered impaired include the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If a long-lived asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group, which is estimated using a present value technique. Critical estimates in determining the fair value of an asset or asset group and the amount of impairment to recognize include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate and the discount rate. Determining the fair value of an asset or asset group is highly judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions for market participants. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn accounting for the issuance of our convertible senior notes, we separate the notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component is calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature, using a discounted cash flow model with a risk adjusted yield. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the notes as a whole. This difference represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the transaction costs related to the issuance of the notes, we allocate the total amount incurred to the liability and equity components using the same proportions as the proceeds from the notes. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component are netted with the liability component and amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. Transaction costs attributable to the equity component are netted with the equity component of the notes in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to \u201cRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 1.

BUSINESS\nOverview\nMax Sound Corporation (\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 9, 2005 as 43010, Inc. to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, locating and negotiating with a business entity for combination in the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. On October 7, 2008, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement, Mr. Greg Halpern purchased a total of 100,000 shares of our common stock from Michael Raleigh for an aggregate of $30,000 in cash. As part of the acquisition, and pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement,\nRaleigh, resigned from all the key executive positions he held in the company, and Mr. Halpern was appointed as our President, CEO, CFO and Chairman. The original business model was developed by Mr. Halpern from October 2008 until January 2011, which focused on developing an Internet search engine and social networking web site launched in January of 2010 featuring an outstanding endorsement and web based commercial by William Shatner for stock warrants.\nBetter capitalized, Silicon Valley, Venture-funded companies crowding the same space with more advanced products, caused the Company to diversify on May 11, 2010, when it acquired the worldwide rights, title and interest to all fields of use for MAX-D HD Audio Technology to which our current website https://www.maxd.audio/showcases, what finally in 2021, is living up to its original vision as major breakthrough technology.\nOn March 8, 2011, the Company changed its name to Max Sound Corporation and its trading symbol on the OTC Bulletin Board to MAXD.\nMAX-D is to Audio what High Definition is to Video and today it works by delivering the best-in-class consumer audio experience rivaling any existing product available to listeners globally. Remarkably, MAX-D accomplishes its auditory miracle without increasing file size and saves on bandwidth usage and cost in the process.\nIn Q2 of 2014, MAXD announced that it had acquired the license and representation rights to VSL\u2019s patented video and data technology known as \u201cOptimized Data Transmission System and Method\u201d (ODT) which enables end-user licensees to transport 100% of data bandwidth content in only 3% of the bandwidth with the identical lossless quality. Significantly, this represented a 33 times reduction associated with transport cost and the time it takes for the video or digital content to be delivered to and viewed by the end-user.\nAlso, in Q2 of 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with architect Eli Attia giving MAXD the exclusive rights to sue violators of Eli Attia\u2019s intellectual property rights. While Eli Attia was teaching his invention at Google [x], the project was internally valued by Google at $120 Billion USD a year in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry to which Attia has been a leader for half a century.\nThe Racketeering (RICO) version of the case has been spearheaded by John E. Floyd, the leading authority on RICO in all fifty states and the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of G. Robert Blakey, the creator of the original RICO statute and the co-author of the Attia\u2019s initial RICO suit against Google and the founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin as well as Google X CEO Astro Teller, Sebastian Thrun, and Flux Factory with its falsely claimed co-inventors Nicholas Chim, Jennifer Carlile, Michelle Kaufmann, Augusto Roman and Astro Teller. In the appealed RICO opening brief, Floyd makes the following points as part of his argument -\n\u201cThe district court misapplied the law in each of its rulings. The court\u2019s statutory standing finding was premised on an unduly restrictive reading of the DTSA and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832 that actually protects-indeed, rewards-the most egregious trade secret mis-appropriators - those who, like Google, steal and then extinguish trade secrets altogether by wrongfully publishing them. Neither the DTSA nor \u00a7 1832, however, can be construed in such a self-defeating manner. And in any event, Google and Flux are equitably estopped from invoking Google\u2019s wrongful publication of Plaintiffs\u2019 trade secrets to evade liability under either the DTSA or RICO.\u201d\nIn October 2019, the Federal Circuit ruled that the Inter Partes Review (IPR) Judges at the Patent Trademark and Appeals Board (PTAB) were not qualified under the United States Constitution, so therefore Googles impairment of the \u2018339 ODT Patent was illegal in the process Max Sound\u2019s Chairman Halpern has been calling \u201ccriminal theft of legitimate American Small Business Inventors under the license for big Corporations to steal known as America Invents Act.\u201d\nTo further clarify MAXD\u2019s current role in the Attia and ODT legal matters described above, the Company is not a party to any of these legal cases that it has an interest in and the potential to profit from in the future. The Company has brought together IP rights holders since 2014 with both Contingency Law Firms and Litigation Financed Law Firms to create the enforcement of Intellectual Property rights holders with cases currently addressing Patent Infringement, Trade Secret Theft, Breach of Contract and Racketeering (\u201cRICO\u201d). MAXD has secured the potential to profit therefrom, as the power of attorney, to negotiate and approve a final financial deal with Google on behalf of the rights holders as either settlements or licensing arrangements both of which have been in and out of negotiations for the past six years. Halpern recently was quoted, \"There are many more cases that will be filed against Anti-trust Monopoly Google for its bad-business-practices for the past decade ultimately going forward until they change their worst-in-class, anti-American approach to inventors. Samsung recently called them the most dishonest company in history. Eight years ago, Google never had heard of little MAX-D. Now, they wish they'd never heard of us. Next up is a few trillion dollars more of exposure to theft where the courts have just looked the other way. While we are finally able to build our business successfully around Google's premeditated thefts, their judicial manipulation and total lack of any ethical standard, MAX-D will never bow down until Google is forced to pay.\"\nDescription of Our Business\nAfter years of R & D and business development that pushed and pulled the company and its HD Audio and Biometric Security technologies in many directions, MAX-D has finally become an important player to several major industries, requiring the best-in-class solutions it offers.\nAs subsequent events all this month of March, MAXD has signed three actual revenue events that create a standard for licensing going forward as follows - MAX-D receives at least 6 figures of upfront money, at least 7 figures over ten years to maintain exclusivity in specific industry or geographical categories, and finally the clear potential for up to 8 figures of residuals from related joint revenue sharing opportunities.\nThanks now to the massive value growth and popularity of Tesla Motors, the Hende Moto Signed License Agreement, has opened up a host of other incoming offers to license from Electric and Hybrid vehicles in several major countries that are in fast moving negotiations at this time. The sudden positive demand for MAX-D, clearly illustrates that it can provide an immediate competitive market advantage over virtually any other brand solution, while simultaneously co-existing as a tremendous complimentary addition to any other popular brand already imbedded in existing hardware and software in the Audio Categories that MAX-D will effortlessly compete in going forward.\nMax Sound (MAX-D) has finally arrived at the on-time moment in history where it has an endless audience of licensing opportunities resulting in newly closed deals that assure MAX-D - at least 6 figures in up front money, 7 figures over ten years and 8 figures of projectible revenue share residuals.\nQualcomm - MAX-D Mobile Voice\nThe Company is currently working under its existing license with Qualcomm offering software code for 600 series Snap Dragon chips. MAX-D Mobile Voice provides clean, intelligible voice call over a standard mobile line without increasing file size and it eliminates the need for special codecs.\nMAX-D Mobile Voice -\n\u2022 Does not require \u201cspecial\u201d hardware in order to work.\n\u2022 Can be implemented into ANY Mobile voice application.\n\u2022 Works on Any Mobile platforms without extra bandwidth use\n\u2022 Can be immediately applied in any cell phone dsp.\n\u2022 Is a dynamic process that adjusts itself according to the use or the needs of the user\n(1.) Test voice enters\n(2.) the ANALYZE VOICE module where the harmonic and amplitude of the voice are analyzed for content.\n(3.)This analyzing will produce a harmonic and dynamic map in the DETERMINE HARMONIC AND AMPLITUDE module to drive the next module.\n(4.) A new voice will be generated using the GENERATE ENHANCED VOICE module. This module will compare the original voice with a model that has been optimized for harmonic and dynamic ranges and apply the difference of the two to create an entirely new voice that has been optimized for clarity in the host device.\n(5.) The ENHANCED VOICE OUTPUT will be output to the host device.\nMAX-D Mobile Voice\nThere is a consumer driven need to improve accuracy & quality of Mobile voice audio.\nThe Problem -\nCell phone electronics commonly have a very limited frequency range. This results in anything from degraded to garbled hearing on the receiving device. The voice recognition engines in devices are very DSP intensive. Usually, to\nimplement a better quality one requires more DSP powering the device, or you can add the Max Sound process and increase the productivity of the existing one.\nThe Solution-\nBy applying the MAX-D VOICE ENHANCEMENT to this audio it becomes much clearer and easir to dicern the voice you are listening to. This process is a digital process meant to be used in the DSP of a device. It can be used on both inbound and outbound calls for improvement of both. On the outbound call, the device receiving the call will receive better than \u201cnormal\u201d audio quality because of the process.\nAs the process increase the intelligability of the audio, it provides the existing voice recognition engine with processed audio of much greater intelligability than without. Thus allowing the existing engine to function with a higher degree of accuracy at a lower DSP cost than totally replacing it.\nSummary of the Invention\n1. A computer implemented method for enhancing processed voice comprising:\na. receiving voice audio; and\nb. enhancing the voice audio in several harmonic and dynamic ranges.\n2. The computer implemented method of embodiment 1, wherein the audio is enhanced by resynthesizing it into full range PCM wave.\n3. The computer implemented method of embodiment 1 or 2, wherein the received mobile voice audio is in compressed format.\n4. The computer implemented method of any one of embodiments 1-3, wherein the voice audio is from an inbound mobile call.\n5. The computer implemented method of any one of embodiments 1-3, wherein the voice audio is from an outbound mobile call.\nDetailed Description of the Invention\nMAX-D Mobile Voice process is used to help clarify both inbound and outbound voice on a Mobile Device. This is accomplished by restoring (resynthesizing) the Mobile Device audio to a much greater harmonic and dynamic range than the original.\nInbound:\nThe user talks into the device, where it goes into the MAX-D Mobile Voice enhancement module. There, the harmonic and dynamic properties are resynthesized into a full range PCM (Pulse-code modulation) wave with extended audio content. Therefore, it has much more clarity to work from instead of the compressed, band limited audio available in the existing cell audio.\nOutbound:\nThe user speaks into the device's microphone and the result is much clearer, more real sounding wave that is transmitted to the call receiver. The transmitted wave retains much of the quality of the original voice, even though it has to be compressed by the cell phone system.\nFigure\nFigure\nThe above picture is an unprocessed voice call from a mobile device.\nHere's a Voice call from a device processed with MAX-D Mobile Voice.\nIn the two graphic examples of a voice call without and with the MAX-D Mobile Voice you can clearly see that we have resynthesized material into the processed wave, thus making it much clearer and much more discernable to the listener.\nOptimized Data Transmission (ODT)\nIn November 2016, MAX-D entered into an agreement with Vedanti Licensing Limited (VLL), and become co-owners of the ODT patents and technology.\nAbout MAX-D HD Audio:\nThe MAX-D software improves the sound heard from any device. Consumers have unknowingly sacrificed better audio quality for portable convenience and MAX-D rectifies this problem by: analyzing what content is missing from the compressed audio signal; dynamically resynthesizing lost harmonics and natural sound fields in real time; maximizing the output potential of any device without increasing original file size; and without requiring consumers or OEM\u2019s to change equipment or infrastructure.\nMAX-D Benefits: Increases dynamic range, eliminates destructive effects of audio compression with no increase in file size or transmission bandwidth; High-resolution audio reproduction with an omni-directional sound field using only two speakers; \u201cReal\u201d three-dimensional sound field, versus artificial sound field created by competing technologies; and More realistic \u201clive performance\u201d quality of all recordings with optimal dynamic range, bass response and overall clarity.\nMAX-D Audio Market:\nMAX-D is targeting primarily Mobile Communication - Voice, Multi-media & Entertainment\nMAX-D is fully compatible with existing playback technology. We believe that no current competitor can provide the level of sound quality and end user experience that MAX-D delivers.\nMAX-D is beginning R&D for integration into the Blockchain Space, finding new ways to use sound to enhance security, provide new ways to imbed and track data of digital assets.\nMAX-D App:\nIn 2018, the Company\u2019s Mobile App user base (with no dedicated marketing budget being employed) had over 1,000,000 subscribers on the free version of our HD Audio App for MP3\u2019s on Android and Apple.\nIn March 2021, the company signed an agreement with TIP SOLUTIONS to develop an updated version of the MAX-D app for Apple iOS and Android.\nMAX-D Technology\nMAX-D is a unique approach to processing sound, based on the physics of acoustics rather than electronics. Remarkably simple to deploy, MAX-D is a technology that dramatically raises the standard for sound quality, with no corresponding increase in file size or transmission channel bandwidth. This is accomplished by processing audio with our proprietary, patent-pending process. This embedded and duplicating format either remains the same or can be converted to whatever format the user desires, while retaining unparalleled fidelity and dynamic range. MAX-D restores the original recorded acoustical space in any listening environment. MAX-D is the only technology that both aligns phase and corrects phase distortion in a completed recording. MAX-D supplies missing audio content by adding acoustics and frequency response lost in the original recording or in the compression and transmission processes. MAX-D corrects and optimizes harmonic content and low frequency responses, greatly enhancing acoustic accuracy and we believe reduces ear fatigue. MAX-D integrates time, phase, harmonics, dynamics, and sub-harmonic region\noptimizations in a fully dynamic fashion. MAX-D is a lossless dynamic process, requiring no destructive encoding/decoding process, or any specialized decoder at all. MAX-D needs no additional hardware or critical monitoring stage after processing. The end result is that every aspect of audio processed with MAX-D - voice, instrument, or special effects - sounds refreshingly clear, realistic, and natural. The MAX-D HD Audio Technology creates an optimum sound field throughout every listening environment - from the corners of a theater; on your living room couch; to the back seat of your car. MAX-D HD Audio Technology requires no equipment changeover and can be embedded into any product (e.g. speakers, headphones, mobile devices), or online content delivery systems (e.g. streaming, cable, video games) to provide better sounding audio.\nMarket\nMAX-D products and services are designed and intended to add high-definition quality and cost-savings to audio components and delivery of several separate industries, including consumer electronics, motion picture, broadcasting, video game, recording, mobile phone, internet, and VOIP applications.\nCompetition\nThe Company\u2019s management believes there are no current direct competitors capable of delivering as high quality of audio technology as its MAXD HD Audio. Although other companies, like DTS or Dolby, have technologies that enhance sound; we do not believe these technologies negatively affect the Company because the MAX-D process can enhance the other audio company\u2019s technology.\nWe believe we will be considered friendly competition in the future for three reasons; (1) we believe that MAX-D technology delivers the best sound quality available today, (2) MAX-D does not require any additional equipment; and (3) MAX-D makes any competition\u2019s audio processes sound better.\nIntellectual Property\nMax-D and HD Audio technologies and designs are Patented, Patents Pending and Trademarked. The Company currently owns Patent No. 9300262, Audio Processing Application for Windows, which was published on November 12, 2015 and then unlawfully assigned to Adli Law Group. Adli Law Group states that the patent has been reassigned to the Company, notwithstanding, the Company is pursuing damages against Adli Law Group. On February 8, 2011, the words \u201cMax Sound\u201d were issued to the Company by the U.S. Patent and Trademark office under Serial Number 85050705.\nOn June 13, 2017, the U.S. Patent and Trademark office Company was granted a \u201cBiometric audio security\u201d patent to the Company under Serial Number 9,679,427\nOn June 2, 2015, the words \u201cHD Audio\u201d were issued to the Company by the U.S. Patent and Trademark office under Serial Number 86395458 for the following applications: Computer application software for mobile phones, namely, software for HD audio; Computer hardware and software systems for delivery of improved HD audio; Computer hardware for communicating audio, video and data between computers via a global computer network, wide-area computer networks, and peer-to-peer computer networks; Computer software for manipulating digital audio information for use in audio media applications; Computer software to control and improve computer and audio equipment sound quality; Digital materials, namely, CD's, DVD's, MP3's, streaming media, movies, videos, music, concerts, news, pre-recorded video, downloadable audio and video and high definition audio and video featuring improved HD audio; Digital media, namely, pre-recorded DVDs, downloadable audio and video recordings, and CDs featuring and promoting improved HD audio; Digital media, namely, pre-recorded video cassettes, digital video discs,\ndigital versatile discs, downloadable audio and video recordings, DVDs, and high definition digital discs featuring improved HD audio; Digital media, namely, CD's, DVD's, MP3's, movies, videos, music, concerts, news, pre-recorded video, downloadable and streaming audio and video and high definition audio and video featuring improved HD audio; Downloadable MP3 files, MP3 recordings, on-line discussion boards, webcasts, webinars and podcasts featuring music, audio books in the field of entertainment and general subjects, and news broadcasts; Software to control and improve audio equipment sound quality; Sound recordings featuring improved HD audio.\nResearch and Development\nThe MAX-D API can be deployed across all streaming platforms along with most audio/video web-based services including mobile audio hardware such as speakers and audio receivers including car smart head units. After nearly a decade of time, and innovation and several million dollars of expenditures, the Company believes in 2021, that it will\ninally license the MAX-D HD Audio on a major scale working with two strategic partners who have global reach and can help to solve a few specific problems for each other by pushing the MAXD HD Audio forward in their technology eco-system.\nOn March 4, 2021, the Company signed a 10-year exclusive licensing agreement with TIP Solutions (Licensee) to implement the MAXD HD Audio Source Code into their mobile phone app and platforms. The Licensee was granted an exclusive license of MAX-D HD audio technology for an annual payment of $100,000 or $25,000 paid quarterly for up to 10 years.\nThe agreement also calls for a license fee split in the event the following occurs:\n\u2022 If Licensor is TIP - 20% of total license revenue received by TIP will be paid to Max Sound within 30 days of such receipts.\n\u2022 If the Licensor is Max Sound and combined with TIP Solutions Smart Call Assistant, 20% of total license revenue received by Max Sound will be paid to TIP within 30 days.\nOn March 9, 2021, the Company received a $100,000 payment from the Licensee.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 1 full time employee.\nAnticipated Milestones for the Next Twelve Months\nFor the next twelve months, our most important goal is to become cash flow positive by growing Max Sound HD Audio sales through licensing and recurring revenue streams. Our goal is to have this growth improve our stock value and investor liquidity. We expect our financial requirements to increase with the additional expenses needed to promote the MAX-D HD Audio Technology. We plan to fund these additional expenses by equity loans from our existing lines of credit and we are also considering various private funding opportunities until such time that our revenue stream is adequate enough to provide the necessary funds.\nThree agreements have been signed in March 2021 under the following general terms -\nLICENSOR hereby grants LICENSEE an individual non-transferable, indivisible and non-exclusive worldwide license as set forth in this Agreement. LICENSEE hereby grants LICENSOR an individual non-transferable, indivisible and non-exclusive worldwide license as set forth in this Agreement.\nLICENSOR can use, but not modify, the Licensed Works (including the MAX SOUND MAX-D DSP audio processor source code) in order to process content available or streamed onto the device and can run on Licensed Products, for processors designated as adequate by LICENSEE.\nLICENSEE shall be granted an exclusive license per their unique industry category upon the completion of the payment of One Hundred Thousand Dollars (100k USD).

As part of the acquisition, and pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Michael Raleigh, our then President, CEO, CFO, and Chairman resigned from all the positions he held in the company, and Mr. Halpern was appointed as our President, CEO CFO and Chairman.\nIn May of 2010, we acquired the world-wide rights to all fields of use for Max Sound HD Audio Technology. In November of 2010, we opened our post-production facility for Max Sound HD Audio in Santa Monica California. In February of 2012, after several successful demonstrations to multi-media industry company executives, we decided to shift the focus of the Company to the marketing of the Max Sound HD Audio Technology and commenced the name change from So Act Network, Inc. to Max Sound Corporation and the symbol from SOAN to MAXD.\nOn December 3, 2012, the Company completed the purchase of the assets of Liquid Spins, Inc., a Colorado corporation (\u201cLiquid Spins\u201d). Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the assets of Liquid Spins were exchanged for 24,752,475 shares of common stock of the Company (the \u201cShares\u201d), equal to $10,000,000 and a purchase price of $.404 per share. The assets of Liquid Spins purchased included: record label distribution agreements; Liquid Spins technology inventory; independent arts programs; retail contracts for music distribution; physical inventory and office equipment; design and retail ready concepts; brand value; records; publishing catalog; and web assets. During 2016, the Company reviewed the intangible asset for impairment and determined that certain items had been impaired due to obsolescence. As a result of this review, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $ 15,703,617 that is recorded as impairment loss on intangible asset.\nNo later than June 20, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with VSL Communications, Inc., making MAXD the exclusive agent to VSL to enforce all rights with respect to patented technology owned and controlled by VSL. In particular, the Company announced that it had acquired a worldwide license and\nrepresentation rights to a patented video and data technology \u201cOptimized Data Transmission System and Method\u201d which enables end-user licensees to transport 100% of data bandwidth content in only 3% of the bandwidth with the identical lossless quality. Significantly, this represents thirty-three times reduction associated with transport cost and the time it takes for the video or digital content to be viewed by an end-user. As described more fully in the Legal Proceedings Section, The Company has since filed suit against Google, Inc., YouTube, LLC, and On2 Technologies, Inc., alleging willful infringement of the patent.\nOn May 22, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with architect Eli Attia giving MAXD the exclusive rights to sue violators of Eli Attia\u2019s intellectual property rights. While Eli Attia was teaching his invention at Google [x], the project was internally valued by Google at $120 Billion USD a year. Since then, Flux has since been spun-out of Google [x], funded and has quickly growing, upon information and belief, to over 800 employees according to one of its founders. MAXD, on behalf of Attia\u2019s, have since filed suit against Google, Inc., Flux Factory, and various executives of these companies for misappropriation of trade secrets. Since this time, the Company has advanced the case(s) and has signed additional agreements with the inventor as late\nas February 21st, 2017 and with additional counsel in June 2018 to support the RICO claim.\nOn November 29, 2016, MAXD entered into an agreement with Vedanti Systems Limited and Vedanti Licensing Limited (VLL) that resolves their dispute over the international Optimized Data Transmission (ODT) patent portfolio previously owned by Vedanti. The agreement further provides that VLL and MAXD will become co-owners of the pioneering portfolio.\nVideos and news relating to the Company is available on the company website at www.maxd.audio. The MAX-D Technology Highlights Video summarizes the HD Audio\u2122 process and shows the need for high definition (HD) Audio in several key vertical markets. The video explains MAX-D as what we believe to be the only dynamic HD Audio\u2122 that is being offered to various markets.\nPlan of Operation\nWe began our operations on October 8, 2008, when we purchased the Form 10 Company from the previous owners. Since that date, we have conducted financings to raise initial start-up money for the building of our internet search engine and social networking website and to start our operations. In 2011, the Company shifted the focus of its business operations from their social networking website to the marketing of the MaxSound HD Audio Technology and in 2014 the Company began litigations against Google and others for infringement of its technologies and associated legal rights to the various proprietary technologies.\nThe Company believes that Max Sound HD Audio Technology is a game changer for several vertical markets whose demand will create revenue opportunities in 2021.\nWe expect our financial requirements to increase with the additional expenses needed to market and promote the MAX-D HD Audio Technology. We plan to fund these additional expenses through financings and through loans from our stockholders and/or officers based on existing lines of credit and we are also considering various private funding opportunities until such time that our revenue stream is adequate enough to provide the necessary funds.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses: Our general and administrative expenses were $89,929 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $110,547 for the year ended December 30, 2019, representing a decrease of 20,618, or approximately 19%, as a result of decrease in the general operation of the Company included decreasing personnel, product development and marketing of our Max Sound Technology.\nConsulting Fees: Our consulting fees were $0 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $20,800 for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing an decrease of $ 20,800, or approximately 100%. The Company has decreased the use of consultants to assist the Company.\nProfessional Fees: Our professional fees were $59,200 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $32,754 for the year ended December 31, 2019, representing increase of $26,446 or approximately 81%, an increase in professional fees was attributable to fees required in connection with filing with the Security and Exchange Commission .\nCompensation: Our compensation expenses were $342,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $450,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, representing a decrease of $108,000, or approximately 24% as a result of decrease in our expensing of monthly compensation to our management.\nNet Loss: Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,497,818. While the operational expenses in marketing our Max Sound technology decreased from the same period of last year, the overall amount of our net loss substantially decreased as a result of a decrease in operating expenses and a decrease in the fair value of embedded derivative liability associated with the convertible debt.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nRevenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, were $0 and $0, respectively. We have an accumulated deficit of $82,972,471 for the period from December 9, 2005 (inception) to December 31, 2020 and have negative cash flow from operations of $18,236 for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of revenues from our subscriber base and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred losses from inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFrom our inception through December 31, 2020, our primary source of funds has been the proceeds of private offerings of our common stock, private financing, and loans from stockholders. For the past 24 months we have not conducted any capital raising activities.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company issued no convertible notes and agreed with its only two debt holders to eliminate all of the moving conversion rights until the S.E.C rightfully enforces Regulation Sho to restore the Company\u2019s equity stolen by Knight Securities and other bad market actors who continue unimpeded in their daily illegal naked short selling of the Company\u2019s shares and in absolute and direct violation of the existing law.\nLoans and Advances\nOn July 6, 2017, the Company entered into a two-year line of credit agreement with the principal stockholder in the amount of $100,000. Subsequently, on October 2, 2017, the Company entered into a two-year line of credit agreement with the principal stockholder in the amount of $200,000. The line of credit carries an interest rate of 4%.\nOn October 2, 2017, the Company, in exchange for Greg Halpern's consideration issuing the Company a line of credit of $100,000 on July 6, 2017 and another line of credit of $200,000 on October 2, 2017 and for Mr. Halpern's forgiveness of $960,000 of interest owed to Mr. Halpern for his Preferred Shares accrued dividend rate of 8% per annum of his already owned 5 million Series A Convertible Preferred Shares, the Board deemed it proper to grant Mr. Halpern an additional 800,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock, which at Mr. Halpern's election he may convert into 5,000,000 additional Series A Convertible Preferred Shares with the same voting rights and percentages as his previously granted and owned 5,000,000 Series A Convertible Preferred Shares.\nThe line of credit balance and accrued interest as of December 31, 2020 is $436,373. During the year ended December 31, 2020, line of credit increased by $89,655.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAll other newly issued accounting pronouncements but not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We\nbelieve our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.\nUse of Estimates:\nIn preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition:\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is assured. We had $0 and $0 in revenue for the ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nIn December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Under FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant. The Company applies this statement prospectively.\nEquity instruments (\u201cinstruments\u201d) issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718. FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employeesdefines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nFair value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity instruments, and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In assessing the convertible debt instruments, management determines if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement. If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt, the Company will continue its evaluation process of these instruments as derivative financial instruments.\nOnce determined, derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives. In addition, the fair value of freestanding derivative instruments such as warrants, are also valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company accounts for its long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-05, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.\" ASC Topic 360-10-05 requires that long-lived assets, such as technology rights, be reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including the eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of an\nasset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset's carrying value and fair value or disposable value.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as \u201cspecial purpose entities\u201d.",

    "item_1": "Item 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nBox is the Content Cloud: one secure, cloud-native platform for managing the entire content journey. Content - from blueprints to wireframes, videos to documents, proprietary formats to PDFs - is the source of an organization\u2019s unique value. Our cloud content management platform enables our customers, including 67% of the Fortune 500, to securely manage the entire content lifecycle, from the moment a file is created or ingested to when it\u2019s shared, edited, published, approved, signed, classified, and retained. Box keeps content secure and compliant, while also allowing easy access and sharing of this content from anywhere, on any device.\nWith our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data protection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations. Box provides a single content platform that accelerates business processes, improves employee productivity, enables secure remote work, and protects an organization\u2019s most valuable data. Our platform enables a broad set of high-value business use cases across enterprises, hundreds of file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers can securely access their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.\nOur go-to-market strategy is focused on selling our platform as a solution for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities, leveraging our product suite offerings, and driving high-value significant business outcomes for our customers. This strategy combines top-down, high-touch sales efforts with end-user-driven bottoms-up adoption. We focus our efforts on larger enterprises, capitalizing on international growth, and utilizing our partner ecosystem, where most advantageous. Our sales representatives engage directly with IT decision makers including CEOs, CIOs, CISOs, IT directors and line of business department heads. We also field inbound inquiries and online sales opportunities. We further expand our market reach by leveraging our network of channel partners that comprises value-added resellers and systems integrators as well as our own consulting services. We offer individuals a free basic version of Box that allows them to experience first-hand our easy-to-use and secure solution. Use of Box often spreads virally within and across organizations, as users adopt Box and invite new users to collaborate. In addition, an organization will frequently purchase Box for one use case and then later expand its deployment to other use cases with larger groups of employees, leading to deeper engagement with our service. We focus our sales strategy on ensuring that new and existing customers understand and experience the transformative impact of Box.\nWe are building a rich technology partner ecosystem around Box. We offer nearly 1,500 pre-built integrations with partners including Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce.com, Apple, Google, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, Okta, Zoom and others, giving our users easy access to their content in Box without leaving these applications. In addition, in-house enterprise developers and independent software developers can use our developer platform and open application programming interfaces (APIs) to rapidly build and provision new applications that leverage and extend the core functionality of our services, increasingly with a focus on specific industries and vertical market use cases. To date, tens of thousands of third-party developers have leveraged our platform as the secure content layer for their applications.\nWe are committed to powering how the world does more good together. Box.org mobilizes our technology, talent, partners and institutional assets to enable nonprofits to innovate and fulfill their missions. Founded in 2014, Box.org now serves over 11,000 nonprofits with donated or discounted Box access, employee volunteer hours and cash grants from the Box.org Fund.\nThe Box Solution\nWe offer web, mobile and desktop applications for cloud content management on a platform for developing custom applications, as well as industry-specific capabilities. Three core capabilities differentiate Box from potential competitors: frictionless security and compliance powered by our global cloud architecture, seamless external and internal collaboration and workflow, and expansive integrations and APIs that extend the value of our Content Cloud to every organization. Box features and functionality include the following:\nFrictionless Security and Compliance\n\u2022\nGlobal Cloud Architecture. We have built our platform from the ground up on a cloud-based architecture, which enables us to rapidly develop, update and provision our services to users. Our proprietary cloud architecture is particularly well-suited for today's dynamically changing business requirements because it enables use of the most up-to-date versions of our solutions at all times and administrators to immediately apply changes in policies and controls across all their organization\u2019s critical content simultaneously. Our modern cloud infrastructure also powers global scalability and reliability with minimal downtime for our customers, ensuring their business-critical content is always secure, compliant, and available.\n\u2022\nEnterprise-Grade Security. We have invested heavily to build robust security features to protect our customers from the most pervasive security threats. At the most basic level, all files stored in Box are encrypted at rest and in transit. Box\u2019s information rights management features enable secure access and management of files by providing granular control over users\u2019 ability to access, view, download, edit, print or share content. With Box KeySafe, organizations can implement higher levels of data security and protection by keeping control of the encryption keys that protect their content. This advanced encryption feature is valuable to many organizations, including those in highly regulated industries such as financial services, health care, government and legal.\n\u2022\nIntelligent Threat Detection and Smart Access with Box Shield. Box Shield uses machine learning to provide granular, real-time prevention and detection capabilities. Box Shield reduces the risk of accidental data leakage through native security classifications and granular access controls by, for example, automatically applying classification to files that contain personal identifiable information. It also detects potential insider threats and compromised accounts through alerts powered by Box's machine learning capabilities.\n\u2022\nComprehensive Data Governance Strategy. Box serves as a secure, centralized system of record for retaining content for operational use while ensuring adherence to the laws and regulations, using data retention and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) capabilities. Our data security policies allow customers to apply quarantine or notification-only policies to sensitive confidential files, such as those containing predefined attributes, such as credit card or social security system numbers, and we provide robust integrations for leading eDiscovery and DLP systems. Our Box Governance product allows customers to control how long documents are to be retained in Box and the disposition of those documents when the retention period expires.\n\u2022\nBox\u2005Zones\u2005for\u2005In-Region\u2005Data\u2005Storage.\u2005Box\u2005Zones\u2005enables\u2005businesses\u2005around\u2005the\u2005globe\u2005to\u2005adopt\u2005Box\u2005as\u2005their\u2005modern\u2005content\u2005management\u2005platform,\u2005while\u2005letting\u2005them\u2005store\u2005their\u2005data\u2005locally in certain regions.\u2005This\u2005helps\u2005organizations\u2005address\u2005region-specific\u2005compliance\u2005mandates\u2005associated\u2005with\u2005data\u2005residency\u2005and\u2005privacy.\u2005\n\u2022\nFocus on Industry-Specific Capabilities. In order to facilitate easier and faster time to market, we offer industry-specific capabilities for those industries that have significant content and collaboration challenges. These features target specific business problems within those industries with a combination of Box, integration with industry-specific partner technologies, and implementation expertise from Box Consulting and/or implementation partners. For example, Box GxP Validation provides life science companies with an approach for maintaining always-on GxP compliance in the cloud and enables organizations subject to Food and Drug Administration regulations to manage both unregulated and regulated content within Box. We successfully serve customers in highly regulated industries with specific requirements relating to compliance with certain security and regulatory standards, such as GxP and FedRAMP, and those required by HIPAA, FINRA, and the HITECH Act.\n\u2022\nAdministrative Controls. We give IT administrators powerful tools to define access rights by user, content type, device, and business need. Administrators can set specific content policies such as expiration dates to auto-delete files or deactivate links to time-sensitive materials. They can also manage mobile and sync security settings, including specification of which devices have access to Box and whether certain features are enabled.\n\u2022\nTracking and Reporting for Visibility. All actions taken by paying business users and their external collaborators in Box are tracked and auditable by our customers\u2019 authorized administrators through Box\u2019s native administrative applications. The tracking and audit data are also accessible to administrators with the appropriate access rights via our APIs.\n\u2022\nSimple and Rapid Deployment. Our cloud-based software allows organizations to deploy our products easily, quickly, and inexpensively. IT administrators can quickly add users, set up permissions, create folders and policies, and begin using our products almost immediately without the need to procure and provision hardware or install and configure software.\nTo give our customers the flexibility to choose between a la carte and bundled subscription options, we offer Box Shield, Box Governance, GxP, and Zones both as standalone add-ons and as part of our bundled Enterprise Suites.\nSeamless Collaboration and Workflow\n\u2022\nInternal and External Collaboration. Box offers deep integrations with all major productivity and collaboration platforms so that users can work together on any file type, in whatever format they choose, with content security and access permissions handled consistently within Box. By enabling users to share, preview, and annotate files in Box, we provide a consistent collaboration layer so that all feedback is captured and preserved within Box. Our Annotations feature enables users to add text-based comments or free-form markups on any file type without altering the underlying content so teams can work together without worrying about version control or data loss.\n\u2022\nReal-Time Collaboration and Content Authoring. Our native content authoring tool, Box Notes, enables users to seamlessly share and collaborate in real time with internal teams and external partners. Box Notes combines lightweight word processing functionality with easy-to-use tables, content organization, and commenting features to make it easy for users to work together on projects in real time.\n\u2022\nMobility. Our solution enables users to securely access, manage, share, and collaborate on their content anytime and from anywhere, using nearly any device and a variety of operating systems through both native and web browser applications. Our mobile apps allow users to preview, comment, and collaborate on content from anywhere, as well as make it easy to add content to Box with native scanning, uploading, and classification.\n\u2022\nElegant, Intuitive and User-Focused Interface. We are dedicated to keeping our solution easy for users to understand with little to no upfront training. We strive to enable quick and viral user adoption by maintaining a simple and elegant interface with compelling access, sharing and collaboration features.\n\u2022\nBuilt to Handle Content of Nearly Any Type. We have designed our solution to serve as the central content management layer for an organization\u2019s employees. Users can securely access, share, and collaborate on all types of information, regardless of format or file type, including large media files, from virtually any device or operating system.\n\u2022\nAutomation and Workflow Management. Box Relay, our no-code process automation tool for content-centric workflows, accelerates productivity by enabling both end users and administrators to build simple process automations. For example, documents can be routed to specific folders or flagged for user action based on the content of the document. In addition, we provide pre-built workflow templates and reporting capabilities to make it easy for users to track and manage their own workflows. This allows customers to accelerate the flow of information through their organizations and increase the efficiency of their business processes. Box Relay is available both as a standalone add-on and as part of our bundled Enterprise Suites.\nIntegrations and Developer Platform\n\u2022\nEasy Integration with Other Cloud-Based Applications. Our open platform allows for easy integration with other cloud-based and enterprise applications. We offer nearly 1,500 pre-built integrations with partners including IBM, Microsoft, Salesforce.com, Google, Facebook, Slack, Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, Zoom, and others, as well as an open API for organizations to integrate Box with other packaged and home-grown applications, including solution applications our customers build for their customers.\n\u2022\nBox Platform. We provide a content Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) product, known as Box Platform, which allows IT teams and third-party developers to extend the power of Box across their applications and build custom content experiences. With our easy-to-use APIs, businesses can create a single source of truth for their content, allowing IT teams to deploy key business applications while easily managing how content is accessed, collaborated on, and secured. Coupled with our robust developer tools, the Box Platform helps organizations accelerate their transformation into digital businesses by building applications faster, without having to invest in building their own content management infrastructure. We also give organizations the ability to apply machine learning algorithms from leading providers such as IBM, Microsoft, and Google, as well as specialized industry-specific vendors directly to content within Box using Box Skills. This eliminates the need for customers to create and manage separate document repositories for performing functions such as image and character recognition, video and audio analysis and transcriptions, and document analysis on business content, thus improving content searchability and business process automation. Box Platform is available as a standalone add-on and as part of our bundled Enterprise Suites.\nCustomers\nOur user base included over 77.7 million registered users as of January 31, 2021. We define a registered user as a Box account that has been provisioned a unique user identification number. As of January 31, 2021, approximately 80% of our registered users were non-paying users who independently registered for accounts (in many cases to enable them to collaborate securely with our paying enterprise user base) and approximately 20% of our registered users were paying users who registered as part of a larger enterprise or business account or by using a paid personal account.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had over 105,000 paying organizations, and our solution was offered in 25 languages. We define paying organizations as separate and distinct buying entities, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a distinct business unit of a large corporation, that have entered into a subscription agreement with us to utilize our services. Organizations typically purchase our solution in the following ways: (i) employees in one or more small groups within the organization may individually purchase our service; (ii) organizations may purchase IT-sponsored, enterprise-level agreements with deployments for specific, targeted use cases ranging from tens to thousands of user seats; (iii) organizations may purchase IT-sponsored, enterprise-level agreements where the number of user seats sold is intended to accommodate and enable nearly all information workers within the organization in whatever use cases they desire to adopt over the term of the subscription; and (iv) organizations may purchase our Box Platform service to create custom business applications for their internal use and extended ecosystem of customers, suppliers and partners.\nWe have developed several programs designed to provide customers with service options to quickly get them up and running and enhance their usage of Box. These services include 24x7 support provided by our Customer Success Management group and certain resellers; a professional services ecosystem that consists of our Box Consulting team and system integrators that help customers implement cloud content management oriented use cases; a Customer Success Management group to assist customers in production; and an online community with self-service training materials, best practice guides and product documentation.\nNo customer represented 10% or more of our revenue in the year ended January 31, 2021. Our geographic revenue and segment information is set forth in Notes 2 and 14, respectively, of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSales and Marketing\nWe offer our solution to customers as a subscription-based service, with subscription fees based on customer requirements, including the number of users and functionality deployed. The majority of our customers subscribe to our service through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging from one month to three years or more. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the contract term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. We recognize revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract.\nWe employ a direct sales team to offer a higher touch experience. We also make it easy for users and organizations to subscribe to paid versions of our service on our self-service web portal. Our sales team is composed of inside sales, outbound sales and field sales personnel who are generally organized by account size and geography, and/or major industry focus. We also have a rich ecosystem of channel partners who expand our reach to both large and small enterprises.\nWe generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs and through our strategic relationships. Our marketing programs target senior IT leaders, technology professionals and senior line of business leaders.\nAs a core part of our strategy, we have developed an ecosystem of partners to both broaden and complement our application offerings and to provide a broad array of services that fall outside of Box\u2019s areas of focus. These relationships include software and technology partners, as well as consulting and implementation services providers that enable Box to address a broader set of use cases for our customers.\nSales and marketing expenses were $275.7 million, $317.6 million and $312.2 million for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nOur ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to product development and our ability to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features and functionality. In simple conceptual form, we provide a single, secure, easy-to-use platform built for the entire content lifecycle. In practice, we develop and maintain a set of sophisticated software services (e.g., search, share, secure, convert/view, logging) around content. These services, which comprise our platform, are used to develop our own applications (e.g., sync, desktop, web, native mobile) and also support the development of third-party applications.\nOur product development organization is responsible for the specification, design, development and testing of our platform and applications. We focus our efforts on providing a platform that accelerates business processes, improves employee productivity, enables secure remote work, and protects an organization\u2019s most valuable data. We strive to continually improve our applications so that they help users and teams become more productive in their day-to-day work.\nResearch and development expenses were $201.3 million, $199.8 million and $163.8 million for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCompetition\nThe cloud content management market is large, highly competitive and highly fragmented. It is subject to rapidly evolving technology, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We face competition from a broad spectrum of technology providers: traditional cloud content management vendors who deploy on-premise and offer deep records management, business process workflow, and archival capabilities; newer mobile enterprise vendors who are beginning to enter the content collaboration market; vendors whose core competency is simple file sync and share, which can be deployed on-premises, hybrid, or via a SaaS delivery model; and social collaboration vendors who focus on the conversations that occur between teams. Our primary competitors in the cloud content management market include, but are not limited to, Microsoft and OpenText (Documentum). In the enterprise file sync and share market, our primary competitors include, but are not limited to, Microsoft, Google and, to a lesser extent, Dropbox.\nWe may face future competition in our markets from other large, established companies, as well as from smaller specialized companies. In addition, we expect continued consolidation in our industry which could adversely alter the competitive dynamics of our markets including both pricing and our ability to compete successfully for customers.\nThe principal competitive factors in our market include:\n\u2022\nenterprise-grade security and compliance;\n\u2022\nscalability of product and infrastructure for large deployments;\n\u2022\nability to store content in multiple geographic locations;\n\u2022\nspeed, availability, and reliability of the service;\n\u2022\nlow-cost, quick deployment;\n\u2022\nagnostic to device, operating system, and file type;\n\u2022\nease of user experience;\n\u2022\ncustomer-centric product development;\n\u2022\ncurrent and forward-thinking product development;\n\u2022\nautomation and workflow management;\n\u2022\ndepth of integration into enterprise applications, including office productivity, desktop and mobile tools;\n\u2022\nrich ecosystem of channel partners and applications;\n\u2022\nopen, extensible platform and APIs for custom application development;\n\u2022\nintelligent content management including metadata capabilities;\n\u2022\nsuperior customer service and commitment to customer success; and\n\u2022\nstrength of professional services organization.\nWe believe that we compete favorably on the basis of these factors, primarily because of our industry-leading security and compliance, cloud-native approach to real-time, internal and external collaboration, and integrations and open platform. Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product development, core technical innovation, platform and partner ecosystem, and customer support. In addition, many of our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, significantly greater resources and established relationships with our partners and customers, which can give them advantageous positioning for their products despite other competitive merits of respective product features and functionality. Some competitors may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can to ours, which could allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new technologies and changes in customer needs.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. As of January 31, 2021, our patents were set to expire between 2028 and 2039. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent that we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.\nWe require our employees, contractors, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. Although we rely on the intellectual property rights and contractual protections described above, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our applications are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our services. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights on a global basis is difficult.\nWe expect that software and other applications in our industry may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.\nBacklog\nWe generally sign annual and multiple-year subscription contracts for our cloud content management services. The frequency of our invoices to each customer is negotiated and varies among our subscription contracts. We continued to focus on annual payment frequencies for multi-year contracts in the twelve months ended January 31, 2021. As a result, for multi-year contracts, we frequently invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. Until amounts are invoiced, they are typically not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue, billings or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements other than disclosed as part of remaining performance obligations. To the extent future invoicing is determined to be certain, we consider such future subscription invoices to be non-cancellable backlog, which is disclosed as part of remaining performance obligations. Future invoicing is determined to be certain when we have an executed non-cancellable contract or a significant penalty is due upon cancellation, and invoicing is not dependent on a future event such as the delivery of a specific new product or feature, or the achievement of contractual contingencies. We had $438.1 million and $353.4 million of non-cancellable backlog as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase of non-cancellable backlog as of January 31, 2021 was primarily driven by expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, longer customer contract durations, the addition of new customers, and the timing of customer-driven renewals.\nWe expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year due to several factors, including the timing and duration of customer subscription agreements, varying price, volume, and invoicing cycles of subscription contracts, the timing of scheduled customer renewals, and foreign currency fluctuations. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not always a reliable indicator of future revenue and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur company is built on people: We call them Boxers. They come from a range of backgrounds and experiences, and each of them has a unique story to tell. Our goal is to fully leverage and engage the individual talents and capabilities of our diverse teams, ultimately creating an inclusive environment where Boxers feel they belong. As of January 31, 2021, we employed 1,934 people. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nOne of our core values is creating a space where all Boxers can \u201cBring your (_____) self to work.\u201d We take great pride in celebrating our differences, and we hire the best talent from all backgrounds. We want to build teams that are as diverse as our customers and the world we live in, with a broad representation of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, backgrounds, and perspectives - among many other dimensions of diversity.\nWhen it comes to recruiting, our hiring philosophy is centered around the belief that building diverse teams enables us to do our best work. Last year, all of our recruiters and hiring managers completed unconscious bias training and we now offer the lessons of unconscious bias training and best practices around interviewing to all interviewers and employees during our LearnFest training series. At our executive recruiting level, our policy is to interview at least one candidate from underrepresented backgrounds for all positions at the director level or above before making a hiring decision. At the university recruiting level, we have instituted programs to connect with underrepresented student groups and create a more fair and equitable hiring process. For example, our Box Business Fellowship provides students of historically underrepresented backgrounds with an opportunity to explore business careers in the tech industry. This program helps students develop the skills to succeed in tech industry roles and provides them with insights into the career opportunities available to them. In addition, participants in this program are also invited to an expedited interview process for available roles at Box.\nWe also ensure that Boxers can Bring their (_____) Self to Work by creating safe spaces for engagement and providing opportunities for networking and development, while promoting a culture of learning and allyship to ensure that the needs of underrepresented Boxers are lifted. We support a dynamic array of employee-led resource communities for historically underrepresented groups and different communities at Box, including Box Women\u2019s Network, Black Excellence Network, Latinx, Pride, and Box Vets, among others. For more information about our diversity and inclusion initiatives, we encourage you to visit our website at https://www.box.com/about-us/diversity-and-inclusion.\nLearning and Development\nWe want all of our employees to have thriving careers where they grow and develop in meaningful ways. There is no one-size-fits-all career path at Box, so we seek to ensure that every Boxer has the tools and support they need to drive their career. We do this by giving all Boxers access to learning and development opportunities based around individual needs in order to build up skill sets and experience. These initiatives include:\n\u2022\nInternal mobility: We acknowledge that career progression looks less like a ladder and more like a climbing wall. We stand behind the idea that enabling our employees to work cross-functionally and within different teams provides a broader perspective of Box that will allow them to succeed in the future.\n\u2022\nLearnFest: LearnFest, our learning lineup for skill development and personal and professional growth, happens three times each year. During LearnFest, the entire company has focused time for trainings, workshops, book clubs, and other learning events.\n\u2022\nProfessional coaching and external leadership development programs: We offer targeted professional coaching for all levels of our executive leadership team (i.e., director-level and above) as well as access to business education and networking programs such as The Leadership Consortium (Harvard), Stanford\u2019s Women\u2019s Executive Leadership program and AWE, Advancing Women Executives.\n\u2022\nOn-Demand Learning: We offer all Boxers access to an on-demand learning platform so they can develop anywhere, anytime, in any skills. There are more than 2,000 courses available at the disposal of any Boxer eager to learn, including over 600 courses aimed at personal development, management, and leadership plus hundreds of tech-based functional skill trainings.\nPay Equity\nWe hold ourselves accountable, which is why we signed the California Equal Pay Pledge. As part of our commitment, we conduct an annual companywide gender pay analysis on hiring and promotion procedures to reduce unconscious bias and structural barriers to equitable compensation. In addition, we externally benchmark the compensation we provide for each role to ensure pay parity, and provide periodic pay equity updates to the compensation committee of our board of directors.\nBoxer Experience Surveys\nWe survey employees two times a year to ensure that everyone\u2019s voice gets heard and we better understand the key areas where we can improve employee experience. These key areas include our experience with our managers, our ability to get work done, and our sense of belonging at work. Survey results are reviewed and become part of our action plans at all levels of the organization. Our People and Communities team incorporates survey feedback into our programs, policies, and the cultivated experiences that drive our culture. Our functional leaders leverage the feedback to drive annual plans across their teams to improve efficiency, establish communication channels, and reinforce behaviors aligned with our values. Finally, following each survey, managers discuss employee experience results with their team and form a plan to address issues that are identified in survey results.\nEmployee Health and Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees is one of our top priorities. We strive to create an environment where Boxers are physically and mentally safe and healthy. We offer a comprehensive health and wellness benefits package to all employees.\nIn response to the COVID-19 crisis, we convened a cross-functional team made up of leaders from across our organization who met frequently to ensure Boxers' safety and that business crisis plans were enacted, communicated, and running smoothly. As part of these plans, Box is offering flexible remote work arrangements to employees through September 2021. To support the well-being of Boxers during these challenging times, we launched \u201cFresh Air Fridays\u201d and \"Mental Health Mondays,\" global company-wide days of paid time off, offered subscriptions to an app for meditation and mental health, partnered with a third-party family support system for families at Box, and provided additional paid time off for our employees, among other things.\nCorporate Information\nOur website address is www.box.com, and our investor relations website is located at www.box.com/investors.

    "item_7": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nBox is the Content Cloud: one secure, cloud-native platform for managing the entire content journey. Content - from blueprints to wireframes, videos to documents, proprietary formats to PDFs - is the source of an organization\u2019s unique value. Our cloud content management platform enables our customers, including 67% of the Fortune 500, to securely manage the entire content lifecycle, from the moment a file is created or ingested to when it\u2019s shared, edited, published, approved, signed, classified, and retained. Box keeps content secure and compliant, while also allowing easy access and sharing of this content from anywhere, on any device - both within the organization and with external partners.\nWith our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform, users can collaborate on content both internally and with external parties, automate content-driven business processes, develop custom applications, and implement data protection, security and compliance features to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies and industry standards and regulations. The Box Content Cloud accelerates business processes, improves employee productivity, enables secure remote work, and protects an organization\u2019s most valuable data. Our platform enables a broad set of high-value business use cases across enterprises, hundreds of file formats and media types, and user experiences. Our platform integrates with leading enterprise business applications, and is compatible with multiple application environments, operating systems and devices, ensuring that workers can securely access their critical business content whenever and wherever they need it.\nIn addition, we continue to innovate by expanding our core services and our offerings with a focus on frictionless security and compliance, seamless internal and external collaboration and workflow, and integration with best-of-breed applications. For example, we provide Box Shield, our advanced security offering that helps customers reduce the risk of accidental data leakage and protect their business from insider threats and account compromise; Box KeySafe, a solution that builds on top of Box\u2019s strong encryption and security capabilities to give customers greater control over the encryption keys used to secure the file contents that are stored with Box; Box Governance, which gives customers a better way to comply with regulatory policies, satisfy e-discovery requests and effectively manage sensitive business information; Box Relay, which allows our end users to easily build, manage and track their own workflows; Box Platform, which further enables customers and partners to build enterprise apps using our open APIs and developer tools; and Box Zones, which gives global customers the ability to store their data locally in certain regions. With Box Consulting, we also provide in-house professional services such as implementation support, content migration, and change management. The increasing success of our add-on products allows our customers to realize the full set of capabilities of our Content Cloud.\nWe offer our solution to our customers as a subscription-based service, with subscription fees based on the requirements of our customers, including the number of users and functionality deployed. The majority of our customers subscribe to our service through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging from one month to three years or more. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. We recognize revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract.\nOur objective is to build an enduring business that creates sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the long term. To best achieve this objective, we focus on growing the number of users and paying organizations through direct field sales, direct inside sales, indirect channel sales and through word-of-mouth by individual users, some of whom use our services at no cost. Individual users and organizations can also simply sign up to use our solution on our website. We believe this approach not only helps us build a critical mass of users but also has a viral effect within organizations as more of their employees use our service and encourage their IT professionals to deploy our services to a broader user base.\nOur user base included 77.7 million registered users as of January 31, 2021. We define a registered user as a Box account that has been provisioned a unique user identification number. As of January 31, 2021, 20% of our registered users were paying users who registered as part of a larger enterprise or business account or by using a paid personal account. As of January 31, 2021, we had over 105,000 paying organizations, and our solution was offered in 25 languages. We define paying organizations as separate and distinct buying entities, such as a company, an educational or government institution, or a distinct business unit of a large corporation, that have entered into a subscription agreement with us to utilize our services.\nOrganizations typically purchase our solution in the following ways: (i) employees in one or more small groups within the organization may individually purchase our service; (ii) organizations may purchase IT-sponsored, enterprise-level agreements with deployments for specific, targeted use cases ranging from tens to thousands of user seats; (iii) organizations may purchase IT- sponsored, enterprise-level agreements where the number of user seats sold is intended to accommodate and enable nearly all information workers within the organization in whatever use cases they desire to adopt over the term of the subscription; and (iv) organizations may purchase our Box Platform service to create custom business applications for their internal use and extended ecosystem of customers, suppliers and partners. Customers can choose between an a la carte approach (i.e., by purchasing specific add-on products to complement their Box subscription) or one of our bundled Enterprise Suites, which include multiple add-on products to help accelerate customer time to value.\nWe intend to continue scaling our organization to meet the increasingly complex needs of our customers. Our sales and customer success teams are organized to efficiently serve organizations ranging from small businesses to the world\u2019s largest global organizations. We have invested in our sales and marketing teams to sell our services around the world, as well as in our development efforts to deliver additional features and capabilities of our cloud services to address our customers\u2019 evolving needs. We also expect to continue to make investments in both our infrastructure to meet the needs of our growing global user base and our professional services organization (Box Consulting) to address the strategic needs of our customers in more complex deployments and to drive broader adoption across a wide array of use cases.\nCurrent Period Highlights\nFor the year ended January 31, 2021, our revenue was $770.8 million, representing year-over-year growth of 11%, and 28% of this revenue came from non-U.S. customers. As of January 31, 2021, our remaining performance obligations were $896.9 million, an increase of 17% from January 31, 2020. For the year ended January 31, 2021, our operating loss was $37.6 million, and our operating margin was negative 5%, representing a 15 percentage point improvement year-over-year. For the year ended January 31, 2021, our free cash flow was positive $120.3 million, an increase of $127.5 million from the year ended January 31, 2020.\nContinuous Innovation\nDespite the pandemic\u2019s impact, we were able to continue delivering product innovation throughout our fiscal year 2021. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we launched several new products including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nMachine learning-based automated classification of sensitive data and proactive malware detection in Box Shield;\n\u2022\nNew capabilities for end users, including an all-new Box user interface, Collections to help users organize and categorize content, and Annotations, which allows users to add text-based comments or free-form markups to any document format without altering the underlying content;\n\u2022\nNew workflow capabilities with Box Relay, including pre-built and custom workflow templates that allow customers to more easily build and implement process automations;\n\u2022\nSignificant improvements to our integrations with Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Zoom to power better remote work experiences for our customers, as well as a new Box for Google Workspace Essentials integration;\n\u2022\nImprovements to our Box Platform offering including a new metadata query toolkit and improved developer onboarding experience; and\n\u2022\nVarious infrastructure improvements, including in-region uploads and downloads in our Australia Zone, as well as a new point-of-presence in Chicago, IL.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global economic activity, worldwide financial markets and social practices. We continue to monitor, analyze and respond to evolving developments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of these efforts, we have taken steps to protect the health and welfare of our employees by temporarily closing most of our offices and suspending almost all business-related travel, while continuing our commitment and efforts to serve customers that rely on us. In addition, we have shifted our customer and marketing events to virtual-only experiences.\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our financial results for our fiscal year 2021, COVID-19 has negatively impacted many of our customers and prospects. As a result, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased customer churn and delayed sales cycles, including customers and prospective customers delaying contract signing or contract renewals, or reducing budgets related to services that we offer. Despite these adverse impacts, the COVID-19 pandemic has also created additional opportunities for Box by enabling our customers\u2019 and prospects\u2019 employees to engage in secure remote work through our platform.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business, results of operations, and financial position will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and include the severity and duration of the pandemic, the availability and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, actions that may be taken by government authorities to contain the virus and minimize its economic impact, passing of or not passing further stimulus packages by governments, the impact of COVID-19 on our customers, business partners and employees, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K. As a result, the extent and magnitude of the impact COVID-19 will have on our business and operating results cannot be predicted at this time.\nOur Business Model\nOur business model focuses on maximizing the lifetime value of a customer relationship. We make significant investments in acquiring new customers and believe that we will be able to achieve a positive return on these investments by retaining customers, cross-selling our add-on products and expanding the size of our deployments within our customer base over time. In connection with the acquisition of new customers, we incur and recognize significant upfront costs. These costs include sales and marketing costs associated with acquiring new customers, such as sales commission expenses, a portion of which are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit, and marketing costs, which are expensed as incurred. We recognize revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the term of the contract. Although our objective is for each customer to be profitable for us over the duration of our relationship, the costs we incur with respect to any customer relationship, whether a new customer or an expansion within an existing customer, may exceed revenue in earlier periods because we recognize those costs faster than we recognize the associated revenue.\nBecause of these dynamics, we experience a range of profitability with our customers depending in large part upon their current stage. We generally incur higher sales and marketing expenses for new customers and existing customers who are still in an expanding stage. For new customers, our associated sales and marketing expenses typically exceed the first year revenue we recognize from those customers. For customers who are expanding their use of Box, we incur various associated marketing expenses as well as sales commission expenses, though we typically recognize higher revenue than sales and marketing expenses. For typical customers who are renewing their Box subscriptions, our associated sales and marketing expenses are significantly less than the revenue we recognize from those customers. These differences are primarily driven by the higher compensation we provide to our sales force for new customers and customer subscription expansions compared to the compensation we provide to our sales force for routine subscription renewals by customers. In addition, our sales and marketing expenses, even after considering deferred incremental compensation we provide to our sales force, are generally higher for acquiring new customers versus expansions or renewals of existing customer subscriptions. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, lower sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue as our existing customer base grows over time and a relatively higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals versus new or expanding Box deployments.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe use the key metrics below for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these key metrics provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these key metrics in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These key metrics also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance as well as comparisons to certain competitors' operating results. We believe these key metrics are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the health of our business. The below data is presented in millions, except for percentage rate data.\nYear Ended January 31,\nRemaining performance obligations (period end)\n$\n896.9\n$\n767.8\n$\n686.3\nRemaining performance obligations growth rate\n%\n%\n-\n*\nBillings\n$\n812.5\n$\n745.1\n$\n672.9\nBillings growth rate\n%\n%\n%\nFree cash flow\n$\n120,324\n$\n(7,238\n)\n$\n13,822\nNet retention rate (period end)\n%\n%\n%\n*\nBox began disclosing remaining performance obligations upon the adoption of ASC Topic 606 on February 1, 2018. Year-over-year comparisons against prior periods before February 1, 2018 are not applicable.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations (RPO) represent, at a point in time, contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. RPO consists of deferred revenue and backlog, offset by contract assets. Backlog is defined as non-cancellable contracts deemed certain to be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Future invoicing is determined to be certain when we have an executed non-cancellable contract or a significant penalty is due upon cancellation, and invoicing is not dependent on a future event such as the delivery of a specific new product or feature, or the achievement of contractual contingencies. While Box believes RPO is a leading indicator of revenue as it represents sales activity not yet recognized in revenue, it is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth as it is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, contract renewal timing, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Box monitors RPO to manage the business and evaluate performance. We do not consider RPO to be a non-GAAP financial measure given that it is calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nRPO increased 17% in the year ended January 31, 2021 over the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase in RPO was primarily driven by expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, longer customer contract durations, the addition of new customers, and the timing of customer-driven renewals.\nBillings\nBillings represent our revenue plus the changes in deferred revenue and contract assets in the period. Billings we record in any particular period primarily reflect subscription renewals and expansion within existing customers plus sales to new customers, and represent amounts invoiced for all of our products and professional services. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. If the customer negotiates to pay the full subscription amount at the beginning of the period, the total subscription amount for the entire term will be reflected in billings. If the customer negotiates to be invoiced annually or more frequently, only the amount billed for such period will be included in billings.\nBillings help investors better understand our sales activity for a particular period, which is not necessarily reflected in our revenue given that we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the contract term. We consider billings a significant performance measure. We monitor billings to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance and allocate resources. We believe that billings offer valuable supplemental information regarding the performance of our business and will help investors better understand the sales volumes and performance of our business. We do not consider billings to be a non-GAAP financial measure given that it is calculated using exclusively revenue, deferred revenue, and contract assets, all of which are financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nBillings increased 9% in the year ended January 31, 2021 over the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase in billings was primarily driven by expansion within existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings, longer customer contract durations, the addition of new customers, and the timing of customer-driven renewals.\nOur use of billings has certain limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenue or an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Billings are recognized when invoiced, while the related subscription and premier services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term as we satisfy a performance obligation. Also, other companies, including companies in our industry, may not use billings, may calculate billings differently, may have different billing frequencies, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of billings as a comparative measure.\nOver time, we expect to continue to normalize payment durations. In addition, as we have gained and expect to continue to gain more traction with large enterprise customers, we also anticipate our quarterly billings to increasingly concentrate in the back half of our fiscal year, especially in the fourth quarter.\nA calculation of billings starting with revenue, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is presented below (in thousands):\nYear Ended January 31,\nGAAP revenue\n$\n770,770\n$\n696,264\n$\n608,386\nDeferred revenue, end of period\n465,613\n423,849\n375,041\nLess: deferred revenue, beginning of period\n(423,849\n)\n(375,041\n)\n(311,109\n)\n*\nContract assets, beginning of period\n-\nLess: contract assets, end of period\n(25\n)\n-\n(3\n)\nBillings\n$\n812,509\n$\n745,075\n$\n672,897\n*\nBalance as of February 1, 2018 upon the adoption of ASC Topic 606\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, principal payments of finance lease liabilities, capitalized internal-use software costs, and other items that did not or are not expected to require cash settlement and that management considers to be outside of our core business. We specifically identify adjusting items in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can possibly be used for investing in our business and strengthening the balance sheet, but it is not intended to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, its nearest GAAP equivalent, is presented in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The presentation of free cash flow is also not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nFree cash flow increased $127.6 million in the year ended January 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase in free cash flow was primarily driven by an increase in cash provided by operating activities of $152.1 million and a decrease in capitalized internal-use software costs of $0.5 million, partially offset by an increase in principal payments of finance lease liabilities of $21.5 million and an increase in capital expenditures of $3.6 million. The primary factors affecting the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities included a decrease of our net loss of $100.9 million, an increase in non-cash charges of $35.7 million primarily driven by an increase in depreciation and amortization of $26.2 million, and favorable changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $15.5 million.\nNet Retention Rate\nNet retention rate is defined as the net percentage of Total Account Value (TAV) retained from existing customers, including expansion. We calculate our net retention rate as of a period end by starting with the TAV from customers as of 12 months prior to such period end (Prior Period TAV) and a subscription customer of Box for at least 12 months. We then calculate TAV from these same customers as of the current period end (Current Period TAV). Finally, we divide the Current Period TAV by the Prior Period TAV and report the average of this calculation over the prior 12 months to arrive at our net retention rate. Prior to fiscal year 2021, we included only TAV from customers with a contract value of $5,000 or more in our net retention rate calculation. As a result of our focus on driving an efficient land and expand go-to-market strategy, large enterprise customers may begin their deployments with contract values below $5,000 and expand significantly over time. Given this strategy, we now include TAV from customers with a contract value of less than $5,000 in our net retention rate calculation. This new methodology, adopted retrospectively in fiscal year 2021, provides a more comprehensive view of how existing customers contribute to our overall revenue growth. We believe our net retention rate is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain and grow revenue from our customer base. Net retention rate is an operational metric and there is no comparable GAAP financial measure to which we can reconcile this particular key metric.\nOur net retention rates were 102%, 104% and 108% as of January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our net retention rates were primarily attributable to seat growth in existing customers and strong attach rates of add-on products. As our customers purchase add-on products, we tend to realize significantly higher average contract values and stronger net retention rates as compared to customers who only purchase our core product. We believe our go-to-market efforts to deliver a solution selling strategy and our investments in product, customer success, and Box Consulting have been a significant factor in our customer retention results. As we penetrate customer accounts, we expect our net retention rate to remain above 100% for the foreseeable future.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue primarily from three sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers who have access to our cloud content management platform, and other subscription-based services, which all include routine customer support; (2) revenue from customers purchasing our premier services package; and (3) revenue from professional services such as implementing best practice use cases, project management and implementation consulting services.\nTo date, practically all of our revenue has been derived from subscription and premier services. Subscription and premier services revenue are driven primarily by the number of customers, the number of seats sold to each customer and the price of our services.\nWe recognize revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the contract term. We typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. Our subscription and premier services contracts are typically non-cancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions. The majority of our customers subscribe to our service through one-year contracts, although we also offer our services for terms ranging between one month to three years or more.\nProfessional services are generally billed on a fixed price basis, for which revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed. Professional services revenue was not material as a percentage of total revenue for all periods presented.\nRevenue is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of costs related to providing our subscription services to our paying customers, including employee compensation and related expenses for data center operations, customer support and professional services personnel, payments to outside technology service providers, depreciation of servers and equipment, security services and other tools, as well as amortization expense associated with acquired technology and capitalized internally developed software. We allocate overhead such as rent, information technology costs and employee benefit costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each of the operating expense categories set forth below.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of each category of operating expenses. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for facilities, information technology costs and employee benefit costs.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, as well as allocated overhead. Our research and development efforts are focused on scaling our platform, building an ecosystem of best-of-breed applications and platforms, infrastructure, adding enterprise grade features, functionality and enhancements such as workflow automation, intelligent content management capabilities, and advanced security to enhance the ease of use of our cloud content management services. We capitalize certain qualifying costs to develop software for internal use incurred during the application development stage.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel-related expenses, as well as allocated overhead. Marketing programs include but are not limited to advertising, events, corporate communications, brand building, and product marketing. Sales and marketing expense also consists of data center and customer support costs related to providing our cloud-based services to our free users. We market and sell our cloud content management services worldwide through our direct sales organization and through indirect distribution channels such as strategic resellers.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation and related expenses for administrative functions including finance, legal, human resources, recruiting, information systems, security, compliance, fees for external professional services and cloud based enterprise systems, as well as allocated overhead. External professional services fees are primarily comprised of outside legal, accounting, audit and outsourcing services.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists of interest expense and interest income. Interest expense consists primarily of interest charges for our line of credit and interest rate swap agreement, interest expense related to finance leases, unused commitment fees on our line of credit, the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs, fees on our letters of credit, and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of our convertible senior notes. Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents. We have historically invested our cash and cash equivalents in overnight deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and short term, investment-grade corporate debt, marketable securities and asset backed securities.\nOther Income (Loss), Net\nOther income (loss), net consists primarily of gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and other income and expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and state income taxes in the United States and, as applicable, changes in our deferred taxes and related valuation allowance positions and uncertain tax positions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in thousands, except per share amounts:\nYear Ended January 31,\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data:\nRevenue\n$\n770,770\n$\n696,264\n$\n608,386\nCost of revenue (1)\n224,738\n215,577\n173,594\nGross profit\n546,032\n480,687\n434,792\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development (1)\n201,262\n199,750\n163,750\nSales and marketing (1)\n275,742\n317,615\n312,210\nGeneral and administrative (1)\n106,670\n102,794\n93,069\nTotal operating expenses\n583,674\n620,159\n569,029\nLoss from operations\n(37,642\n)\n(139,472\n)\n(134,237\n)\nInterest expense, net\n(7,010\n)\n(2,338\n)\n(316\n)\nOther income (loss), net\n2,426\n(1,128\n)\n1,339\nLoss before provision for income taxes\n(42,226\n)\n(142,938\n)\n(133,214\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n1,207\n1,410\n1,398\nNet loss\n$\n(43,433\n)\n$\n(144,348\n)\n$\n(134,612\n)\n(1)\nIncludes stock-based compensation expense as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\nCost of revenue\n$\n18,936\n$\n16,769\n$\n14,065\nResearch and development\n61,145\n62,565\n45,189\nSales and marketing\n42,015\n38,030\n36,864\nGeneral and administrative\n32,196\n28,624\n23,178\nTotal stock-based compensation\n$\n154,292\n$\n145,988\n$\n119,296\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented as a percentage of our revenue:\nYear Ended January 31,\nPercentage of Revenue:\nRevenue\n%\n%\n%\nCost of revenue (1)\nGross profit\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development (1)\nSales and marketing (1)\nGeneral and administrative (1)\nTotal operating expenses\nLoss from operations\n(5\n)\n(20\n)\n(22\n)\nInterest expense, net\n(1\n)\n(1\n)\n-\nOther income (loss), net\n-\n-\n-\nLoss before provision for income taxes\n(6\n)\n(21\n)\n(22\n)\nProvision for income taxes\n-\n-\n-\nNet loss\n(6\n)\n%\n(21\n)\n%\n(22\n)\n%\n(1)\nIncludes stock-based compensation expense as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\nCost of revenue\n%\n%\n%\nResearch and development\nSales and marketing\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal stock-based compensation\n%\n%\n%\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019 can be found under Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 19, 2020, which is available on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov.\nComparison of the Years Ended January 31, 2021 and 2020\nRevenue\nYear Ended January 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenue\n$\n770,770\n$\n696,264\n$\n74,506\n%\nThe increase in revenue was primarily driven by expansion within our existing customers as they broadened their deployment of our product offerings with strong attach rates of add-on products at higher price per seat. Additionally, the increase in subscription services is also driven by the addition of new customers, as the number of paying organizations increased by 8% from January 31, 2020 to January 31, 2021. In the year ended January 31, 2021, we experienced strong growth in the Japan market, driving an increase in revenue from non-U.S. customers to 28%, compared to 25% in the year ended January 31, 2020. This increase is partially offset by customers partially churning their deployment with Box.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended January 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nCost of revenue\n$\n224,738\n$\n215,577\n$\n9,161\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nThe increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $9.3 million in depreciation primarily related to additional data center equipment, an increase of $8.6 million in software and maintenance expense primarily driven by increases in amortization of internally developed software and on-premises contracts, an increase of $3.3 million in rent for our data centers, and an increase of $2.2 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by equity grants to existing and new employees. The increase in cost of revenue expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $14.8 million in hosted data service costs. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased 2 percentage points year-over-year. We expect our cost of revenue to increase in dollars but decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue over time as we continue to optimize infrastructure efficiency.\nResearch and Development\nYear Ended January 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nResearch and development\n$\n201,262\n$\n199,750\n$\n1,512\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nThe increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a decrease of $4.9 million in capitalized internally developed software costs and an increase of $3.0 million in employee and related costs. The increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $3.3 million in stock-based compensation expense, a decrease of $1.8 million in allocated overhead costs, a decrease of $0.7 million in outside agency and consulting services, and a decrease of $0.6 million in travel-related costs. Research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 3 percentage points year-over-year. We continue to invest in enhancements of our products and services, developing new products, and further differentiating our offerings. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in dollars but remain relatively stable as a percentage of revenue over time, as we continue to make significant improvements to our cloud content management product offerings and services, including expanding our advanced security, compliance, collaboration, workflow automation, and integration capabilities.\nSales and Marketing\nYear Ended January 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nSales and marketing\n$\n275,742\n$\n317,615\n$\n(41,873\n)\n(13\n)%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nThe decrease in absolute dollars was primarily due to decreases of $19.9 million and $7.4 million in employee and related costs and allocated overhead costs, respectively, primarily driven by a decrease in headcount from 880 as of January 31, 2020 to 773 as of January 31, 2021. In addition, there were decreases of $13.0 million and $2.4 million in travel-related costs and company events, respectively, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease of $6.2 million in marketing expenses, driven by a $5.0 million decrease in expenses related to BoxWorks, which transitioned into a virtual experience in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, a decrease of $2.7 million in data center and customer support costs to support our free users, and a decrease of $2.2 million in outside agency and consulting services. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was partially offset by an $11.1 million increase in commission expenses primarily driven by increased sales and increased amortization of deferred commissions and a $4.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense driven by equity grants to existing and new employees. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased 9 percentage points year-over-year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our focus on driving greater efficiency from our solution selling strategy and simplifying our product offerings, as well our focus on higher performing geographies and segments producing a greater return on investment.\nOur sales and marketing expenses are generally higher for acquiring new, or expanding existing, customers than for renewals of existing customer subscriptions. We expect to continue to invest in capturing our large market opportunity globally and capitalize on our competitive position with continued focus on our long-term margin objectives. We expect our sales and marketing expenses will continue to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time, as our existing customer base grows and a relatively higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals versus new or expanding Box deployments and as we continue to focus on improving sales productivity and simplifying our product offerings. While we expect certain expenses that were reduced due to COVID-19 to partially return over time, we do not expect to return to pre-COVID-19 levels, even after we return to an office-based environment.\nGeneral and Administrative\nYear Ended January 31,\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nGeneral and administrative\n$\n106,670\n$\n102,794\n$\n3,876\n%\nPercentage of revenue\n%\n%\nThe increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of $3.8 million in stock-based compensation expense driven by equity grants to existing and new employees and an increase of $0.9 million in employee and related costs. The increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in outside agency costs and consulting services. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased 1 percentage point year-over-year.

Our cash and cash equivalents are comprised primarily of overnight cash deposits and money market funds. We generated positive cash flows from operations as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the twelve-month period ended January 31, 2021. While we may continue to incur operating losses, we expect to continuously improve overall cash flows from operations through improvements to our working capital management processes to provide capital resources for strategic initiatives to grow our business.\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through equity, cash generated from sales and debt financing. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with our finance leases and credit facilities, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, data center expansions, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing and international operation activities, the introduction of new and enhanced service offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our services. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nIn January 2021, we issued $345.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.00% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and do not bear regular interest. Each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes will initially be convertible into 38.7665 shares of our Class A common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $25.80 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.\nThe Notes are convertible at the option of the holders of the Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 15, 2025, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on April 30, 2021 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not\nconsecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five-business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the \u201cmeasurement period\u201d) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our Class A common stock and the conversion rate for the Notes on each such trading day; (3) if we call the Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events.\nOn or after October 15, 2025, holders of the Notes may convert all or any portion of their Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date regardless of the foregoing conditions. Effective February 5, 2021, we have made an irrevocable election to settle the principal portion of the Notes only in cash. Accordingly, upon conversion, we will pay the principal portion in cash and we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, the conversion premium in cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company\u2019s election.\nWe may not redeem the Notes prior to January 20, 2024. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on or after January 20, 2024, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest to, but excluding the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes, which means we are not required to redeem or retire the Notes periodically.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) prior to the maturity date, subject to certain conditions, holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nAs of January 31, 2021, the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert were not met.\nOn November 27, 2017, we entered into a secured credit agreement (as amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the \u201cNovember 2017 Facility\u201d) and on July 12, 2019, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the November 2017 Facility. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, among other changes, (i) the maturity date of borrowings under the November 2017 Facility was extended from November 27, 2020 to July 12, 2022; (ii) the revolving commitments were increased from $85.0 million to $100.0 million; (iii) the sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit was increased from $30.0 million to $45.0 million; (iv) the covenant in the November 2017 Facility that limits the amount of finance leases and debt that we can incur to finance the acquisition, construction or improvement of any equipment or capital assets was increased from $100.0 million to $200.0 million; and (v) a clause for the issuance of debt constituting convertible debt securities was added, limiting the debt to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the greater of (a) $350.0 million and (b) immediately after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of such debt, an amount that would not cause the total leverage ratio to exceed 6.00 to 1.00. The total leverage ratio is defined in Amendment No. 1 as the ratio of (a) all outstanding funded debt to (b) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), as of the end of the twelve-month period most recently ended for which financial statements are available. The proceeds of the revolving loans may be used for general corporate purposes. The revolving loans accrue interest at a prime rate plus a margin of 0.25% or, at our option, a LIBOR rate (based on one, three or six-month interest periods) plus a margin of 1.00%. Interest on the revolving loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to loans based on the prime rate and at the end of an interest period in the case of loans based on the LIBOR rate (or at each three-month interval if the interest period is longer than three months). Borrowings under the November 2017 Facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets. The November 2017 Facility requires us to comply with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum liquidity requirement. Additionally, the November 2017 Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants limiting our, and our subsidiaries\u2019, ability to, among other things, grant liens, incur debt, pay dividends or distributions on the capital stock, effect certain mergers, make investments, dispose of assets and enter into transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to customary exceptions for a credit facility of the size and type of the November 2017 Facility.\nAs of January 31, 2021, debt outstanding under the November 2017 Facility was $30.0 million.\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended January 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $196.8 million. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $43.4 million, offset by non-cash charges of $154.3 million for stock-based compensation, $75.5 million for depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and capitalized software, $36.1 million for amortization of deferred commissions, and net cash outflows of $26.6 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers for the changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $48.0 million increase in deferred commissions primarily due to new and expanded deployments with paying customers during the period, a $45.7 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, an $18.9 million increase in accounts receivable that was primarily due to higher sales and relative timing of our cash collections, and a $12.3 million decrease in accounts payable, partially offset by a $41.8 million increase in deferred revenue that was primarily due to seasonality in our sales cycle which is concentrated in the back half of our fiscal year, predominantly in the last quarter, a $40.7 million decrease in operating right-of-use assets, a $9.4 million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, and a $6.3 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $44.7 million. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $144.3 million, offset by non-cash charges of $146.0 million for stock-based compensation, $59.4 million for depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and capitalized software, $25.9 million for amortization of deferred commissions, and net cash outflows of $42.1 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers for the changes in operating assets and liabilities include a $44.0 million increase in deferred commissions primarily due to new and expanded deployments with paying customers during the period, a $35.1 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, a $34.3 million increase in accounts receivable that was primarily due to higher sales and relative timing of our cash collections, a $7.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a $5.9 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by a $48.8 million increase in deferred revenue that was primarily due to seasonality in our sales cycle which is concentrated in the back half of our fiscal year, predominantly in the last quarter, and a $35.4 million decrease in operating right-of-use assets.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities of $16.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2021 was primarily due to $9.1 million of fixed asset purchases to support our offices and employees and $7.4 million of capitalized internally developed software costs associated with the development of additional significant features and functionality to our products.\nCash used in investing activities of $13.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2020 was primarily due to $8.0 million of capitalized internally developed software costs associated with the development of additional significant features and functionality to our products. In addition, included in cash used in investing activities was $5.5 million of fixed asset purchases to support our increased headcount.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities of $218.7 million for the year ended January 31, 2021 was primarily due to $308.6 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes, $30.0 million of additional borrowings on our November 2017 Facility, $18.6 million from issuances of common stock under the 2015 ESPP, and $10.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $60.0 million of principal payments of finance lease liabilities, $48.8 million of employee payroll taxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock, and $40.0 million of payment towards our November 2017 Facility.\nCash used in financing activities of $53.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2020 was primarily due to $43.3 million of employee payroll taxes paid related to net share settlement of restricted stock, $38.5 million of principal payments of finance lease liabilities, and $0.9 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with business combinations in fiscal year 2019, partially offset by $23.4 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock under the 2015 ESPP and $6.0 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of January 31, 2021 (in thousands):\nPayments Due by Period\nLess Than 1\nMore Than\nTotal\nYear\n1-3 Years\n3-5 Years\n5 Years\nNovember 2017 Facility (1)\n$\n31,263\n$\n$\n30,327\n$\n-\n$\n-\nConvertible senior notes (2)\n345,000\n-\n-\n345,000\n-\nOperating lease liabilities, net of sublease income amounts (3)\n281,016\n59,002\n97,669\n60,783\n63,562\nFinance leases (4)\n116,470\n53,788\n61,127\n1,555\n-\nPurchase obligations (5)\n265,640\n11,540\n42,432\n211,668\n-\nTotal\n$\n1,039,389\n$\n125,266\n$\n231,555\n$\n619,006\n$\n63,562\n(1)\nIncludes principal, interest, and unused commitment fees on our line of credit under the November 2017 Facility.\n(2)\nConsists of principal on our 0.00% convertible senior notes due January 15, 2026.\n(3)\nIncludes operating lease liabilities for certain of our offices and data centers. As of January 31, 2021, we expected to receive sublease income of $22.5 million over the next four years from tenants in certain of our leased facilities. The amounts set forth in the table above do not include any sublease income amounts nor does the table include payments for short-term leases or variable lease payments.\n(4)\nIncludes obligations related to our servers and related equipment for our data center operations.\n(5)\nIncludes purchase obligations which were not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2021, related primarily to infrastructure services and IT software and support services costs. Our contracts for infrastructure services and IT software, which have terms ranging from 2 to 8 years, support our long-term goals of improving gross margin. In addition to the purchase obligations included in the table above, as of January 31, 2021, we had recognized a total of $14.9 million related to non-cancellable contractual purchases, which were included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on the balance sheet. $9.2 million, $3.8 million, and $1.9 million is due to be paid in the years ending January 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough January 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 of the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from three sources: (1) subscription revenue, which is comprised of subscription fees from customers who have access to our cloud content management platform, and other subscription-based services, which all include routine customer support; (2) revenue from customers purchasing our premier services package; and (3) revenue from professional services such as implementing best practice use cases, project management and implementation consulting services.\nRevenue is recognized when control of these services is transferred to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.\nWe determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n\u2022\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022\nDetermination of the transaction price\n\u2022\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022\nRecognition of revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation\nSubscription and Premier Services Revenues\nWe recognize revenue as we satisfy a performance obligation. Accordingly, due to our subscription model, we recognize revenue for our subscription and premier services ratably over the contract term.\nWe typically invoice our customers at the beginning of the term, in multiyear, annual, quarterly or monthly installments. Our subscription and premier services contracts generally range from one to three years in length, are typically non-cancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Revenue is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities.\nProfessional Services\nProfessional services are generally billed on a fixed price basis, for which revenue is recognized over time based on the proportion performed.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts can include multiple performance obligations which may consist of some or all of subscription services, premier services, and professional services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, the customer demographic, the geographic area where services are sold, price lists, our go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and contract prices.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of billings in advance of revenue recognition generated by our subscription services, premier services, and professional services described above.\nDeferred Commissions\nSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for new contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have estimated to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, our technology and other factors. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. Amortization expense is included in sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.\nInternal-Use Software Costs\nWe capitalize costs to develop software for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, qualifying internal and external costs are capitalized until the application is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalized qualifying costs are amortized on a straight-line basis when the software is ready for its intended use over an estimated useful life, which is generally three years. Internal-use software costs also include on-premises software, which is amortized over the lesser of five years or the license term. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nLeases\nWe determine whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To determine whether a contract is or contains a lease, we consider all relevant facts and circumstances to assess whether the customer has both of the following:\n\u2022\nthe right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset\n\u2022\nthe right to direct the use of the identified asset\nWe recognize lease liabilities and right-of-use assets at lease commencement. We measure lease liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term discounted using the rate implicit in the lease when that rate is readily determinable or our incremental borrowing rate. We estimate our incremental borrowing rate based on an analysis of publicly traded debt securities of companies with credit and financial profiles similar to our own and adjust our incremental borrowing rate to reflect the corresponding lease term. We do not include in the lease term options to extend or terminate the lease unless it is reasonably certain that we will exercise any such options. We account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all our leases.\nWe measure right-of-use assets based on the corresponding lease liabilities adjusted for (i) prepayments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, (ii) initial direct costs we incur, and (iii) tenant incentives under the lease. We evaluate the recoverability of our right-of-use assets for possible impairment in accordance with our long-lived assets policy. We do not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases, which have a lease term of twelve months or less, and recognize the associated lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nOperating leases are reflected in operating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, finance lease liabilities, and finance lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe begin recognizing rent expense when the lessor makes the underlying asset available to us. We recognize rent expense under our operating leases on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, we record interest expense on the lease liability in addition to amortizing the right-of-use asset (generally straight-line) over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the right-of-use asset. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included within the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets calculation. We generally recognize sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards granted to our employees and other service providers, including stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock and purchase rights granted under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (2015 Plan) and 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2015 ESPP), based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards and purchase rights granted under our 2015 Plan and 2015 ESPP. We use the market closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the fair value of restricted stock units and restricted stock granted after our initial public offering. We recognize the fair value of stock options, restricted stock units and restricted stock as an expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We recognize the fair value of purchase rights granted under our 2015 ESPP as an expense on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\nOur Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of certain assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent management\u2019s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u2019s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nThese assumptions are estimated as follows:\n\u2022\nFair Value of Common Stock. We use the market closing price for our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange to determine the fair value of our common stock at each grant date.\n\u2022\nExpected Term. The expected term represents the period that our share-based awards are expected to be outstanding. The expected term assumptions were determined based on the vesting terms, exercise terms and contractual lives of the options and 2015 ESPP purchase rights.\n\u2022\nExpected Volatility. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, we have estimated the expected volatility of the stock option grants and 2015 ESPP purchase rights based on the historical volatility of our Class A common stock over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants and 2015 ESPP purchase rights, respectively. In previous years, we derived the expected volatility from the historical stock volatilities of several unrelated public companies within the same industry that we considered to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants and 2015 ESPP purchase rights as we did not have sufficient trading history of our Class A common stock.\n\u2022\nRisk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free rate that we use is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options and 2015 ESPP purchase rights.\n\u2022\nDividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and, therefore, use an expected dividend yield of zero.\nRefer to Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock option and ESPP purchase rights.\nFor performance-based restricted stock units that vest based upon continued service and achievement of certain performance conditions established by the board of directors for a predetermined period, the fair value is determined based upon the market closing price of our Class A common stock on the date of the grant; compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance condition will be satisfied based on the accelerated attribution method.\nIn addition, we have issued performance-based stock options that vest based upon continued service through the vesting term and achievement of certain market conditions established by the board of directors for a predetermined period. We measure stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock options containing market conditions based on the estimated grant date fair value determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model; we recognize compensation expense for such awards over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method.\nWe estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares that are expected to vest. We estimate the expected forfeiture rate at the date of grant based on historical experience and our expectations regarding future pre-vesting termination behavior of employees and other service providers and revise the estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nLong-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented.\nWe review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies goodwill impairment and measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized by comparing the fair value of our single reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is required; otherwise, any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. No impairment of goodwill has been identified during the years presented.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are typically amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is generally two to seven years. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any such impairment charges during the years presented.\nRecently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the effect of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements on our financial statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), \u201cUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,\u201d defines and prescribes the conditions for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, and free cash flow (collectively, the non-GAAP financial measures) each meet the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures and our key metrics for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics also facilitate management\u2019s internal comparisons to our historical performance as well as comparisons to our competitors\u2019 operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business.\nNon-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP operating margin\nWe define non-GAAP operating income (loss) as operating income (loss) excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation (SBC), acquired intangible assets amortization, and as applicable, other special items. Non-GAAP operating margin is defined as non-GAAP operating income (loss) divided by revenue. Although SBC is an important aspect of the compensation of our employees and executives, determining the fair value of certain of the stock-based instruments we utilize involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expense recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the vesting or future exercise of the related stock-based awards. Furthermore, unlike cash compensation, the value of stock options, which is an element of our ongoing stock-based compensation expense, is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond our control. For restricted stock unit awards, the amount of stock-based compensation expenses is not reflective of the value ultimately received by the grant recipients. Management believes it is useful to exclude SBC in order to better understand the long-term performance of our core business and to facilitate comparison of our results to those of peer companies. Management also views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company\u2019s developed technology and trade names, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, one that is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Furthermore, Box excludes the following expenses as they are considered by management to be special items outside of Box\u2019s core operating results: (1) fees related to shareholder activism, which include directly applicable third-party advisory and professional service fees, (2) expenses related to certain litigation, (3) expenses associated with restructuring activities, consisting primarily of severance and other personnel-related costs, and (4) expenses related to announced acquisitions, including transaction and discrete tax costs. There are no expenses related to litigation excluded from non-GAAP operating income (loss) in any of the periods presented.\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share\nWe define non-GAAP net income (loss) as net loss excluding expenses related to stock-based compensation, acquired intangible assets amortization and as applicable, other special items. We specifically identify other adjusting items in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss). These items include expenses related to certain litigation and the amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs associated with our Notes, which are amortized as interest expense, because they are considered by management to be special items outside our core operating results. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares. Similarly, the same adjusting items specified in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss) are also excluded from the calculation of non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, principal payments of finance lease liabilities, capitalized internally developed software costs, and other items that did not or are not expected to require cash settlement and that management considers to be outside of our core business. We specifically identify other adjusting items in our reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. We consider free cash flow to be a profitability and liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can possibly be used for investing in our business and strengthening the balance sheet; but it is not intended to represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. A reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities, its nearest GAAP equivalent, is presented below. The presentation of free cash flow is also not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nLimitations on the use of non-GAAP financial measures\nA limitation of our non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not have uniform definitions. Our definitions will likely differ from the definitions used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore comparability may be limited. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, in the case of stock-based compensation expense, if we did not pay a portion of compensation in the form of stock-based compensation expense, the cash salary expense included in costs of revenue and operating expenses would be higher which would affect our cash position.\nWe compensate for these limitations by reconciling non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nThe following table sets forth our reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures for years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except per share data and percentages). We adopted ASC Topic 842, effective February 1, 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method.

The Hawk Purchase Agreement also provides for additional consideration, in the event of achievement of certain revenue targets, to the selling shareholders as an additional earn-out, payable no later than December 31, 2022. The acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration was $2.2 million.\nThere were no acquisitions during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nResearch and Development\nWe have research and development activities focusing on creating new products and innovations, product enhancements, and funding future market opportunities. Research and development expenses were approximately $2.4 million or 18% of revenues and $1.6 million or 15% of revenues during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nEmployees\nHuman Capital\nBridgeline is dedicated to creating the best digital presence for our customers, and our employees are critical to achieving this mission. In order to continue to design innovative experiences and products, and compete and succeed in our highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, we continue to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. As part of these efforts, we strive to offer a competitive compensation and benefits program, foster a community where everyone feels included and empowered to do to their best work.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 60 full-time employees. Of our full-time employees, approximately 48 were in the United States and the remaining were in our various international locations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\nCompensation and Benefits Program\nOur compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, incentive bonuses, and long-term stock option awards tied to the value of our stock price. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests, including by incentivizing business and individual performance (pay for performance), motivating based on long-term company performance and integrating compensation with our business plans. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer employees benefits such as life and health (medical, dental & vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, and a 401(k) plan.\nCustomers\nWe primarily serve the following vertical markets that we believe have a history of investing in information technology enhancements and initiatives:\n\u25cf\nFinancial Services\n\u25cf\nFranchise/Dealer Networks\n\u25cf\nRetail Brand Names\n\u25cf\nHealth Services and Life Sciences\n\u25cf\nHigh Technology (software and hardware)\n\u25cf\nCredit Unions and Regional Banks\n\u25cf\nAssociations and Foundations\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, no customer exceeded 10% of the Company\u2019s total revenues. For the year ended September 30, 2020, one customer generated approximately 12% of our revenue.\nCompetition\nThe markets for our products and services, including software for web content management, eCommerce platform software, eMarketing software, web analytics software and digital engagement services are highly competitive, fragmented, and rapidly changing. Barriers to entry in such markets remain relatively low. The markets are significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future.\nWe believe we compete adequately with others and we distinguish ourselves from our competitors in a number of ways, including:\n\u25cf\nWe believe our competitors generally offer their web application software as a single point of entry type product (such as content management only, or commerce only) as compared to the deeply integrated approach provided by Bridgeline\u2019s platforms.\n\u25cf\nWe believe our competitors can generally only deploy their solutions in either a Cloud/SaaS environment or in a dedicated server environment. Bridgeline\u2019s platform\u2019s architecture is flexible and some are capable of being deployed in either a Cloud/SaaS or dedicated server environment.\n\u25cf\nWe believe the majority of our competitors do not provide interactive technology development services that complement their software products. Our ability to develop mission critical websites and online stores on our own deeply integrated platforms provides a quality end-to-end solution that distinguishes us from our competitors.\n\u25cf\nWe believe the interface of the Bridgeline platforms have been designed for ease of use without substantial technical skills.\n\u25cf\nFinally, we believe the Bridgeline platforms offers a competitive price-to-functionality ratio when compared to our competitors.\nPatents, Trademarks, and Trade Secrets\nWe own a number of trade secrets, licenses and trademarks related to Bridgeline products and services and their loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company. We do not own any patents. For additional information see Risk Factor - If we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights, our ability to compete in the marketplace may be substantially reduced.\nAvailable Information\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, along with any amendments to those reports, are made available upon request, on our website www.bridgeline.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).

For the year ended September 30, 2021, no customers exceeded 10% of the Company\u2019s total revenue. For the year ended September 30, 2020, one customer represented approximately 12% of the Company\u2019s total revenue.\nSummary of Results of Operations\nTotal revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 (\u201cfiscal 2021\u201d) increased to $13.3 million from $10.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 (\u201cfiscal 2020\u201d). Loss from operations for fiscal 2021 was $1.2 million, compared with loss from operations of $1.6 million for fiscal 2020. We had a net loss for fiscal 2021 of $6.7 million, which included government grant income related to Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) loan forgiveness of $88 thousand, a loss of approximately $5.9 million as a result of the change in fair value of certain warrant liabilities and a $1.2 million discrete benefit in taxes, compared with net income of $326 thousand, which included government grant income related to PPP loan forgiveness of $960 thousand and a gain of approximately $1.0 million as a result of the change in fair value of certain warrant liabilities for fiscal 2020. Basic and diluted net loss per share calculation attributable to common shareholders for fiscal 2021 was ($1.47) compared with the equivalent basic net loss per share attributable to common shareholders of ($0.59) for fiscal 2020.\n(in thousands)\nYears Ended\nSeptember 30,\n$\n%\nChange\nChange\nNet Revenue\nDigital engagement services\n$ 3,296\n$ 3,409\n$ (113 )\n(3 )%\n% of total net revenue\n%\n%\nSubscription and perpetual licenses\n9,963\n7,498\n2,465\n%\n% of total net revenue\n%\n%\nTotal net revenue\n13,259\n10,907\n2,352\n%\nCost of revenue\nDigital engagement services\n1,743\n1,831\n(88 )\n(5 )%\n% of digital engagement services revenue\n%\n%\nSubscription and perpetual licenses\n2,790\n2,676\n%\n% of subscription and perpetual revenue\n%\n%\nTotal cost of revenue\n4,533\n4,507\n%\nGross profit\n8,726\n6,400\n2,326\n%\nGross profit margin\n%\n%\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing\n2,726\n2,614\n%\n% of total revenue\n%\n%\nGeneral and administrative\n2,359\n2,455\n(96 )\n(4 )%\n% of total revenue%\n%\n%\nResearch and development\n2,387\n1,641\n%\n% of total revenue\n%\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n1,202\n%\n% of total revenue\n%\n%\nRestructuring and acquisition related expenses\n1,235\n%\n% of total revenue\n%\n%\nTotal operating expenses\n9,909\n8,044\n1,865\n%\nLoss from operations\n(1,183 )\n(1,644 )\n(28 )%\nInterest expense and other, net\n(883 )\n(7 )\n(876 )\n12,514 %\nGovernment grant income\n(872 )\n(91 )%\nChange in fair value of warrant liabilities\n(5,885 )\n1,028\n(6,913 )\n(672 )%\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n(7,863 )\n(8,200 )\n(2,433 )%\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n(1,174 )\n(1,185 )\n(10,773 )%\nNet income/(loss)\n$ (6,689 )\n$\n$ (7,015 )\n(2,152 )%\nNon-GAAP Measure:\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 1,839\n$ (116 )\n$ 1,955\n(1,685 )%\nRevenue\nOur revenue is derived from two sources: (i) digital engagement services and (ii) subscription and perpetual licenses.\nDigital Engagement Services\nDigital engagement services revenue is comprised of Bridgeline Unbound implementation and retainer-related services. Total revenue from digital engagement services decreased $113 thousand, or 3%, to $3.3 million in fiscal 2021 from $3.4 million in fiscal 2020. Digital engagement services revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 25% in fiscal 2021 from 31% in fiscal 2020. The decrease compared to the prior period is primarily due to a decrease in new service engagements partially offset by $325 thousand related to revenues from the Company\u2019s fiscal 2021 acquisitions.\nSubscription and Perpetual Licenses\nRevenue from subscription (SaaS) and perpetual licenses increased $2.5 million, or 33%, to $10.0 million in fiscal 2021 from $7.5 million in fiscal 2020. The increase compared to the prior period is primarily due to significant multi-year license renewals across our diverse portfolio of Fortune 500 companies and the inclusion of revenue of $2.6 million from the Company\u2019s fiscal 2021 acquisitions. Subscription and perpetual license revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 75% in fiscal 2021 from 69% in fiscal 2020. The increase as a percentage of total revenue is attributable to the additional increase in subscription and perpetual licenses during the period compared to digital services revenue.\nCost of Revenue\nTotal cost of revenue for fiscal 2021 increased $26 thousand, or 1%, to $4.5 million from $4.5 million. The increase for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily attributable to decreases in headcount and the use of third-party consultants.\nCost of Digital Engagement Services\nCost of digital engagement services decreased $88 thousand, or 5%, to $1.7 million in fiscal 2021 from $1.8 million in fiscal 2020. The decrease in cost of digital engagement services in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the allocation of support team and third-party subcontractor costs and additional costs related to the fiscal 2021 business acquisitions. The cost of total digital engagement services as a percentage of total digital engagement services revenue decreased to 53% in fiscal 2021 from 54% in fiscal 2020. The decrease as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the overall decrease in digital engagement services revenue and costs incurred related to fiscal 2021 business acquisitions, as noted above.\nCost of Subscription and Perpetual License\nCost of subscription and perpetual licenses increased $114 thousand, or 4%, to $2.8 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $2.7 million in fiscal 2020. The increase in cost of subscription and perpetual licenses in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to a reduction within our fixed costs to operate our cloud-based hosting model with Amazon Web Services and variable internal support costs. The cost of subscription and perpetual licenses as a percentage of subscription and perpetual license revenue decreased to 28% in fiscal 2021 from 36% in fiscal 2020. The decrease as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the overall increases in subscription and perpetual license revenue.\nGross Profit\nGross profit increased $2.3 million, or 36%, in fiscal 2021 to $8.7 million compared to $6.4 million in fiscal 2020.The gross profit margin increased to 66% for fiscal 2021 compared to 59% for fiscal 2020. The increase in the gross profit margin for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily attributable to decreases in headcount and the use of third-party consultants and an increase in the proportion of license revenue, which is generally associated with higher margins, to digital engagement service revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses increased $112 thousand, or 4%, to $2.7 million in fiscal 2021 from $2.6 million in fiscal 2020. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 21% in fiscal 2021 compared to 24% in fiscal 2020. The increase compared to the prior period is primarily attributable to the allocation of third-party subcontractor and partner costs and additional costs related to the fiscal 2021 business acquisitions. The decrease as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the overall increase in revenues.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $96 thousand, or 4%, to $2.4 million in fiscal 2021 from $2.5 million in fiscal 2020. General and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 18% in fiscal 2021 compared to 23% in fiscal 2020. These net decreases compared to the prior period are primarily attributable to an overall decrease in support headcount and personnel expenses offset by increases associated with business acquisitions in fiscal 2021.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense increased $746 thousand, or 45%, to $2.4 million in fiscal 2021 from $1.6 million in fiscal 2020. Research and development expense as a percentage of total revenue increased to 18% in fiscal 2021 compared to 15% for fiscal 2020. These increases compared to the prior period are primarily attributable to the allocation of support team and third-party subcontractor costs and additional research and development expenses related to the business acquisitions in fiscal 2021.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $234 thousand, or 24%, to $1.2 million in fiscal 2021 from $968 thousand in fiscal 2020. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenue remained consistent at 9% in fiscal 2021 and 2020. The increase compared to the prior period is primarily due to amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions completed during fiscal 2021.\nRestructuring and Acquisition Related Expenses\nIn connection with the acquisition of businesses completed during the fiscal 2021 second and third quarters, the Company incurred acquisition related legal and investment banking expenses of $1.2 million during fiscal 2021.\nDuring fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $366 thousand related to a reduction in the workforce in its U.S. and Canada operations aimed at improving efficiencies by combining functions, certain responsibilities and eliminating redundancies, which resulted in a reduction of 15 positions.\nLoss from Operations\nThe loss from operations was $1.2 million for fiscal 2021 compared to a loss from operations of $1.6 million for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $461 thousand or 28%.\nInterest expense and other, net; Government grant income; Change in fair value of warrant liabilities\nThe Company recognized a loss related to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $5.9 million, for the year ended September 30, 2021 and a gain related to the change in fair value of warrant liabilities of $1.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2020, respectively.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized government grant income of $88 thousand and $960 thousand, respectively, associated with proceeds received under the PPP deemed probable to be forgiven based on the actual expenditures from the date proceeds were received by the Company through September 30, 2020. The Company applied for full PPP loan forgiveness on March 29, 2021 and received approval from the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s (the \u201cSBA\u201d) in August 2021. The Company classifies unexpended loan proceeds on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a current or noncurrent liability based on the contractual maturities of the underlying loan agreement. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the remaining loan proceeds were expended on qualified expenses and as a result, the Company recognized $88 thousand of government grant income.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, interest expense and other net, was $883 thousand and $7 thousand, respectively and included non-recurring non-operating costs.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for (benefit from) income taxes was ($1.2) million for fiscal 2021 and $11 thousand for fiscal 2020, respectively. Income tax expense consists of estimated liability for federal and state income taxes owed by the Company. Net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards are estimated to be sufficient to offset any potential taxable income for all periods presented. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company maintains a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets. As of September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets.\nThe Federal NOL carryforward is approximately $32 million as of September 30, 2021 in which the 20-year carryforward expires on various dates through 2037 and the remaining NOL carryforward is indefinite. Net operating losses incurred after December 31, 2017 carry forward indefinitely. Internal Revenue Code Section 382 places certain limitations on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by NOL carryforwards after a change in control of a loss corporation. Generally, after a change in control, a loss corporation cannot deduct NOL carryforwards in excess of the Section 382 limitation. Due to these \u201cchange of ownership\u201d provisions, utilization of NOL carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation on utilization against taxable income in future periods. The Company has not performed a Section 382 analysis. However, if performed, Section 382 may be found to limit potential future utilization of our NOL carryforwards. The Company also has approximately $30 million in state NOLs which expire on various dates through 2039.\nThe acquisition of Hawk Search, Inc. during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 resulted in the recognition of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $1.1 million, related to intangible assets. Prior to the business combination, the Company had a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets. The deferred tax liabilities generated from the business combination netted against the Company\u2019s pre-existing deferred tax assets. Consequently, the impact of such resulted in the release of $1.1 million of the pre-existing valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets and corresponding deferred tax benefit recognized during fiscal 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe also measure our performance based on a non-GAAP (\u201cGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles\u201d) measurement of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, non-cash warrant related expenses, other income and expenses, change in fair value of derivative instruments, change in fair value of contingent consideration, and restructuring and acquisition related charges (\u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d).\nWe believe this non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to management and investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented and provides a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA, however, is not a measure of operating performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) and should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for U.S. GAAP profitability measures such as (i) income from operations and net income, or (ii) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, both as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure has material limitations because it excludes the financial statement impact of income taxes, net interest expense, amortization of intangibles, depreciation, goodwill impairment, restructuring charges, acquisition related expenses, loss on disposal of assets, other amortization, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and stock-based compensation, and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should be evaluated in conjunction with net income (loss) for a complete analysis of our profitability, as net income (loss) includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP operating performance measure to Adjusted EBITDA. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may also differ from and therefore may not be comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of the limitations that Adjusted EBITDA has as an analytical tool, investors should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table reconciles net income (loss) (which is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP operating performance measure) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nYears Ended\nSeptember 30,\nNet income (loss)\n$ (6,689 )\n$\nProvision for income tax\n(1,174 )\nInterest expense and other, net\nGovernment grant income\n(88 )\n(960 )\nChange in fair value of warrants\n5,885\n(1,028 )\nAmortization of intangible assets\n1,130\nDepreciation\nRestructuring and acquisition related charges\n1,235\nOther amortization\nStock-based compensation\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 1,442\n$ (116 )\nAdjusted EBITDA increased year over year, which is primarily attributable to increases in revenues due to business acquisitions that occurred in fiscal 2021 and cost control measures.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities was $989 thousand during fiscal 2021 compared to cash used in operating activities of $498 thousand during fiscal 2020. The change in cash used in operating activities compared to the prior period was primarily due to an increase in loss from operations partially offset by changes in non-cash items, including changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, and changes to accounts payable and accrued liabilities and deferred revenue.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $4.5 million during fiscal 2021 and we did not have any cash flows from investing activities during fiscal 2020. Cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2021 was primarily related to net cash paid for the purchase of businesses during the second and third fiscal quarters of 2021.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $13.5 million during fiscal 2021 compared with $1.0 million during fiscal 2020. Cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to cash proceeds of approximately $14.3 million related to the issuance of common stock, Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and stock options and warrant exercises partially offset by re-payments of contingent consideration and long-term debt assumed in connection with the acquisition of a business. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 was attributable to the proceeds received under the PPP.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity Outlook\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) as a pandemic. We expect our operations in all locations to be affected as the virus continues to proliferate. We have adjusted certain aspects of our operations to protect employees and customers while still meeting customers\u2019 needs for vital technology. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and it is possible that we will implement further measures. In light of the uncertainty as to the severity and duration of the pandemic, the impact on our revenue, profitability and financial position is uncertain at this time.\nIn July 2021, the Company received approximately $5.8 million in cash relating the issuance of 1,543,779 shares of its common stock upon exercise of Series A Warrants, originally issued in March 2019, with an exercise price of $4.00 per share.\nOn May 14, 2021, the Company offered and sold, in a registered direct offering, a total of 1,060,000 shares of its common stock par value $0.001 per share, at a price of $2.28 per share. On the same day, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements with certain institutional investors in connection with a private placement of 2,700 shares of newly designated Series D Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $1,000 per share and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 592,105 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. The aggregate proceeds, net of cash paid for certain fees due to placement agents and transaction-related expenses, of these two transactions that occurred on the same day was $4.6 million.\nOn February 4, 2021, the Company offered and sold a total of 880,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to certain institutional and accredited investors at a public offering price of $3.10 per share in a registered direct offering. The aggregate proceeds from this transaction, net of certain fees due to placement agents and transaction expenses, was approximately $2.5 million.\nIn connection with an acquisition of a business completed during the 2021 fiscal year third quarter (Hawk Search), the Company recognized an obligation for a deferred payment representing a portion of the purchase price of $2.0 million payable on or before December 31, 2021 and contingent earn-out payments of $2.2 million which are payable, no later than December 31, 2022, in the event of achievement of certain revenue targets and operational goals.\nIn connection with an acquisition of a business completed during the 2021 fiscal year second quarter (Woorank), the Company (1) assumed the outstanding long-term debt obligations of $2.1 million of the acquiree of which $732 thousand is payable over the next twelve months, (2) issued a seller note of $352 thousand to one of the selling shareholders payable over a five-year period, (3) deferred a portion of the purchase price of $376 thousand which is expected to be paid within the next twelve months, and (4) recognized contingent earn-out payments of $1.3 million which are payable in the event of achievement of certain revenue targets and operational goals.\nIn prior years, the Company incurred operating losses and used cash to fund operations, develop new products, and build infrastructure. During its 2020 fiscal year, the Company executed an operating plan that reduced operating expenses and headcount. The Company continued to maintain tight control over discretionary spending for the 2021 fiscal year. The Company believes that future revenues and cash flows will supplement its working capital and it has an appropriate cost structure to support future revenue growth.\nOn April 17, 2020, the Company entered into a loan with an aggregate principal amount of $1,047,500, pursuant to the PPP. The Company performed initial calculations for PPP loan forgiveness according to the terms and conditions of the SBA Loan Forgiveness Application (Revised June 16, 2020) and, based on such calculations, expected that the PPP loan will be forgiven in full based on usage of related proceeds over a period less than 24 weeks. In addition, the Company determined it was probable the Company will meet all the conditions of the PPP loan forgiveness. The Company applied for full PPP loan forgiveness on March 29, 2021, and received approval from the SBA in August 2021. The Company classifies unexpended loan proceeds on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a current or noncurrent liability based on the contractual maturities of the underlying loan agreement. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the remaining loan proceeds were expended on qualified expenses and as a result, the Company recognized $88 thousand as government grant income.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt this time, the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, other than our operating leases.\nContractual Obligations\nWe lease all of our office locations. The gross obligations for operating leases and subleases is $550 thousand and $236 thousand, respectively, of which $185 thousand and $101 thousand is expected in the next twelve months. Debt payments on the Company\u2019s various debt obligations total $1.9 million of which $732 thousand is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. Contingent consideration payments total $3.4 million of which $1.2 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. Deferred purchase price payments total $2.4 million of which $2.2 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThese critical accounting policies and estimates by our management should be read in conjunction with Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements that were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses in the reporting periods. We regularly make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. The most significant estimates included in our consolidated financial statements are the valuation of accounts receivable and long-term assets, including intangibles, goodwill and deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation, amounts of revenue to be recognized on service contracts in progress, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenue. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment:\n\u25cf\nRevenue recognition;\n\u25cf\nAllowance for doubtful accounts;\n\u25cf\nAccounting for goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u25cf\nAccounting for business combinations;\n\u25cf\nAccounting for Payroll Protection Program; and\n\u25cf\nAccounting for stock-based compensation.\nRevenue Recognition\nOverview\nThe Company derives its revenue from two sources: (i) Software Licenses, which are comprised of subscription fees (\u201cSaaS\u201d), perpetual software licenses, and maintenance for post-customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d) on perpetual licenses, and (ii) Digital Engagement Services, which are professional services to implement our products such as web development, digital strategy, information architecture and usability engineering search. Customers who license the software on a subscription basis, which can be described as \u201cSoftware as a Service\u201d or \u201cSaaS\u201d, do not take possession of the software.\nRevenue is recognized when control of these services is transferred to the Company\u2019s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The Company\u2019s subscription service arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. Revenue is reported net of applicable sales and use tax.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using a five-step model, which is described below:\n1.\nIdentify the customer contract;\n2.\nIdentify performance obligations that are distinct;\n3.\nDetermine the transaction price;\n4.\nAllocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and\n5.\nRecognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.\nIdentify the customer contract\nA customer contract is generally identified when there is approval and commitment from both the Company and its customer, the rights have been identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability and consideration is probable.\nIdentify performance obligations that are distinct\nA performance obligation is a promise to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and the Company\u2019s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nDetermine the transaction price\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding sales taxes that are collected on behalf of government agencies.\nAllocate the transaction price to distinct performance obligations\nThe transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices (\u201cSSP\u201d) of the goods or services being provided to the customer. The Company determines the SSP of its goods and services based upon the historical average sales prices for each type of software license and professional services sold.\nRecognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied\nRevenue is recognized when or as control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers. Revenue from SaaS licenses is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the license is made available to customers. Most subscription contracts are three-year terms. Customers who license the software on a perpetual basis receive rights to use the software for an indefinite time period and an option to purchase post-customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d). PCS revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period of performance and the perpetual license is recognized upon delivery. The Company also offers hosting services for those customers who purchase a perpetual license and do not want to run the software in their environment. Revenue from hosting is recognized ratably over the service period, ranging from one to three-year terms. The Company recognizes revenue from professional services as the services are provided.\nCustomer Payment Terms\nPayment terms with customers typically require payment 30 days from invoice date. Payment terms may vary by customer but generally do not exceed 45 days from invoice date. Invoicing for digital engagement services are either monthly or upon achievement of milestones and payment terms for such billings are within the standard terms described above. Invoices for subscriptions and hosting are typically issued monthly and are generally due in the month of service. The Company\u2019s subscription and hosting agreements provide for refunds when service is interrupted for an extended period of time and are reserved for in the month in which they occur, if necessary.\nOur digital engagement services agreements with customers do not provide for any refunds for services or products and therefore no specific reserve for such is maintained. In the infrequent instances where customers raise a concern over delivered products or services, we have endeavored to remedy the concern and all costs related to such matters have been insignificant in all periods presented.\nWarranty\nCertain arrangements include a warranty period, which is generally 30 days from the completion of work. In hosting arrangements, we provide warranties of up-time reliability. We continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the warranties to identify if a warranty claim may arise. If we determine that a warranty claim is probable, then any related cost to satisfy the warranty obligation is estimated and accrued. Warranty claims to date have been immaterial.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which represents estimated losses resulting from the inability, failure or refusal of our clients to make required payments.\nWe analyze historical percentages of uncollectible accounts and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We use an internal collection effort, which may include our sales and services groups as we deem appropriate. Although we believe that our allowances are adequate, if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if we underestimate the allowances required, additional allowances may be necessary, resulting in increased expense in the period in which such determination is made.\nAccounting for Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of every fiscal year and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The purpose of an impairment test is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit including goodwill to its fair value. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nFactors that could lead to a future impairment include material uncertainties such as operational, economic and competitive factors specific to the key assumptions underlying the fair value estimate we use in our impairment testing that have a reasonable possibility of changing. This could include a significant reduction in projected revenues, a deterioration of projected financial performance, future acquisitions and/or mergers, and a decline in our market value as a result of a significant decline in our stock price.\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nThe Company allocates the amount it pays for each acquisition to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets which arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The Company bases the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management\u2019s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. The Company allocates any excess purchase price that exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated growth rates, cash flows and discounts rates and estimated useful lives could result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods. Transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. In those circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, the Company recognizes a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments expected to be made as of the acquisition date. The Company re-measures this liability each reporting period and records changes in the fair value through income (loss) before income taxes within the consolidated statements of operations.\nAccounting for Payroll Protection Program\nU.S. GAAP does not contain authoritative accounting standards for forgivable loans provided by governmental entities to a for-profit entity. Absent authoritative accounting standards, interpretative guidance issued and commonly applied by financial statement preparers allows for the selection of accounting policies amongst acceptable alternatives. Based on the facts and circumstances, the Company determined it most appropriate to account for the PPP loan proceeds as an in-substance government grant by analogy to International Accounting Standards 20 (\u201cIAS 20\u201d), Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. Under the provisions of IAS 20, \u201ca forgivable loan from a government is treated as a government grant when there is reasonable assurance that the entity will meet the terms for forgiveness of the loan.\u201d IAS 20 does not define \u201creasonable assurance\u201d; however, based on certain interpretations, it is analogous to \u201cprobable\u201d as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) ASC 450-20-20 under U.S. GAAP, which is the definition the Company has applied to its expectations of PPP loan forgiveness. Under IAS 20, government grants are recognized in earnings on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognizes costs for which the grant is intended to compensate (i.e. qualified expenses). Further, IAS 20 permits for the recognition in earnings either separately under a general heading such as other income, or as a reduction of the related expenses. The Company has elected to recognize government grant income separately within other income to present a clearer distinction in its consolidated financial statements between its operating income and the amount of net income resulting from the PPP loan and subsequent expected forgiveness. The Company believes this presentation method promotes greater comparability amongst all periods presented.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nAt September 30, 2021, we maintained two stock-based compensation plans, one of which has expired but still contains vested and unvested stock options. The two plans are more fully described in Note 12 of these consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Topic of the Codification. Share-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values.\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for share-based payments issued or assumed after October 1, 2006 that are expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally three years. We recognize the fair value of the unvested portion of share-based payments granted prior to October 1, 2006 over the remaining service period, net of estimated forfeitures. In determining whether an award is expected to vest, we use an estimated, forward-looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rate and reduce the expense over the recognition period. Estimated forfeiture rates are updated for actual forfeitures quarterly. We also consider, each quarter, whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our forfeiture rate. Although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience, actual forfeitures in the future may differ. In addition, to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates, we record a true-up for the difference in the period that the awards vest, and such true-ups could materially affect our operating results.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions, including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options. The risk-free interest rate assumption we use is based upon United States Treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards. We use the historical volatility of our publicly traded options in order to estimate future stock price trends. In order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options, we use historical trends of employee turnovers. Our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense we record to vary.\nWe record deferred tax assets for stock-based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns, based on the amount of stock-based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction.",

We offer SaaS solutions and managed services for search, social and eCommerce.\nSearch, Social and eCommerce\nOur current product lineup consists of MarinOne and our two legacy products, Marin Search and Marin Social. We have been migrating customers, and we expect to continue to migrate customers in the first half of 2021, from Marin Search and Marin Social to MarinOne.\n\u2022\nMarinOne. Our next-generation platform that brings search, social and eCommerce advertising into a single-platform. MarinOne helps advertisers maximize a customer journey that spans Google, Facebook, Twitter and Amazon by combining the power of Marin Search and Marin Social with newer channels like LinkedIn, Apple Search Ads and YouTube.\n\u2022\nMarin Search.

Forecasting capabilities help predict campaign performance, which simplifies the budgeting process for marketing departments.\n\u2022\nReporting and Analytics.

Through integrations across multiple data sources, our Connect module can help advertisers have a holistic picture of their digital advertising campaigns.\nIn November 2019, we completed the divestiture of the assets and liabilities related to our Perfect Audience business, which focused on display retargeting advertisements, to SharpSpring, Inc. an unrelated third party for net proceeds of $4.3 million, as further described in Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nTechnology & Supporting Platform\nWe designed our cloud-based platform to support large global advertisers. The majority of our software is written in Java. Our hardware consists of industry-standard servers and network infrastructure. Our standard operating system is Linux. Our software platform is character-set, language, currency, and time-zone independent. Our technology platform has the following key benefits:\n\u2022\nScalability. Our platform is designed to handle billions of advertising units across thousands of advertisers, while delivering a responsive browsing and editing experience. If the number of advertisers and resulting computing and storage requirements changes, we can add or remove hardware to our platform to accommodate the demand.\n\u2022\nAvailability. Our customers are highly dependent on the availability of our platform, which is designed to be available 24x7, 365 days a year. We operate our own hardware and use third-party data centers that offer server redundancy, back-up communications and power and physical security.\n\u2022\nSecurity. Our platform manages a large quantity of customer data. We employ technologies, policies and procedures to protect customer data. The primary third-party data center that we use to host our platform has SSAE No. 18, Type 2 SOC 1, SOC 2 and SOC 3 attestations and is ISO 27001 certified.\nWe are continuously upgrading our software platform in a manner that we believe will cost-effectively extend the scalability, speed, resiliency and availability of our services and facilitate our ability to add new features to our products.\nStrategic Agreements\nWe have entered into long-term strategic agreements with certain leading search publishers. Under these strategic agreements, we receive consideration based on a percentage of the search advertising spend that our customers manage on our platform.\nIn December 2018, we entered into such an agreement with Google, under which we receive revenue share payments based on our customers' search advertising spend on Google and certain other eligible search engines. In exchange, we will reinvest a percentage of these revenue share payments to drive our technology platform innovation. This agreement went into effect on October 1, 2018, and is scheduled to terminate on September 30, 2021, although Google may terminate the agreement in certain circumstances. We are in preliminary discussions with Google to extend potentially the term of this agreement, but no assurances can be provided as to whether the term will be extended or as to terms of any extension of the agreement. This agreement and the related revenue recognition considerations are described more fully in Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nCustomers\nWe market and sell our technology solutions to advertisers directly and through advertising agencies that use our platform on behalf of their customers. Advertisers that we serve through our relationships with agencies generally represented approximately one-\nthird to one-quarter of our overall revenues. We also generate revenues from leading publishers through our long-term strategic agreements.\nCompetition\nThe digital advertising cloud market is highly competitive, fragmented, and subject to changes in both technology and customer behavior. We face significant competition today and expect competition to intensify in the future. To maintain and improve our competitive position, we must keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers and continue to develop and introduce new modules, features and services in a timely and efficient manner. We currently compete with large, well-established companies, such as Adobe Systems Incorporated, Facebook, Inc., Google Inc. (through its wholly owned subsidiary DoubleClick) and Kenshoo Ltd. We also compete with in-house proprietary tools, tools from publishers and custom solutions, including spreadsheets. We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:\n\u2022\nsolution quality, breadth, stability, flexibility and functionality;\n\u2022\ntangible platform benefits;\n\u2022\nlevel of customer satisfaction and our ability to respond to customer needs rapidly;\n\u2022\nbreadth and quality of advertiser and agency relationships;\n\u2022\nability to innovate and develop new or improved products and features while maintaining platform speed and stability;\n\u2022\nability to respond to changes in publishers\u2019 application programming interfaces;\n\u2022\nbrand awareness and reputation; and\n\u2022\nsize of customer base.\nApart from cross-channel platform competitors, we also compete with channel solutions in the social advertising market. Competitors in the social advertising market include companies such as 4C Insights, Inc., Salesforce.com (through its wholly owned subsidiary Social.com) and Smartly.io Inc.\nOur ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance in the areas of the quality, functionality and breadth of our solution and the availability and knowledgeability of our customer support.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell our solutions directly to advertisers and agencies in a wide range of industries through our global sales team. Our sales cycle can vary substantially by advertiser and agency, but can take between three and nine months. We have eight account directors organized by geography and market segments. The same account directors are responsible for long-term customer satisfaction and retention, renewal, support and driving an increase in the volume of media managed by customers on our platform.\nOur marketing team is focused on driving awareness and demand generation across major markets. This team provides thought leadership in the form of white papers, benchmarking reports, bylines, presenting at industry conferences and speaking to the press. In addition, they are responsible for the creation of field enablement assets such as case studies, blog posts and corporate and product collateral.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development team is responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of our platform. Our research and development process emphasizes frequent, iterative and incremental development cycles. Within our research and development organizations, we have several project teams that focus on platform and feature development for our advertising cloud solutions. Each of these project teams includes engineers, quality engineers and product managers, as needed, responsible for the initial and ongoing development for their projects.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business in the advertising and SaaS industries and on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. The manner in which existing laws and regulations will be applied to the SaaS and advertising industries and the Internet in general and how they will relate to our business in particular, are often unclear. For example, we often cannot be certain how existing laws will apply in the eCommerce and online context, including with respect to such topics as privacy, advertising, pricing, taxation, content regulation, quality of products and services and intellectual property ownership and infringement. In addition, in 2020 U.S. federal and\nstate and foreign governments and regulatory agencies initiated lawsuits or investigations against Google and Facebook related to certain of their anticompetitive business practices and conduct in the digital advertising and social media industries and we cannot be certain as to how such lawsuits and investigations might affect Google or Facebook or otherwise affect the digital advertising industry.\nNumerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States, and in some cases internationally, that have a direct impact on our business and operations. For example, on January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act went into effect, providing consumers the right to know what personal data companies collect, how it is used, and the right to access, delete and opt of sale of their personal information to third parties. Additionally, in May 2019, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, governing data privacy replaced the Data Protection Directive and established new requirements applicable to the handling of personal data and imposes penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of \u20ac20,000,000 or 4% of worldwide revenue.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur employees are our greatest asset. Our performance depends upon identifying, attracting, developing, motivating and retaining a highly skilled workforce in multiple areas, including engineering, sales and marketing, and customer service. Collectively, our employees have extensive experience and knowledge in digital marketing and we believe that we employ some of the top talent in our industry.\nWorkforce Demographics\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 162 employees, which was down from a total of 292 employees at December 31, 2018 and a total of 229 employees at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, approximately 45% of our employees were located in the United States, with approximately 40% of our employees located in Europe and approximately 15% of our employees located in Asia. At December 31, 2020, approximately one-half of our employees were on our engineering and research and development teams, with the remainder of our employees comprising our sales and marketing, customer service, and general and administrative teams.\nDuring 2020, one of our strategic initiatives was the implementation of a restructuring plan in the third quarter of 2020, which included a global reduction-in-force and other cost saving actions to reduce our operating expenses and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business (the \u201c2020 Restructuring Plan\u201d). The 2020 Restructuring Plan resulted in the reduction of our global workforce by approximately 60 employees, approximately half of which were located outside of the United States. We also experienced some senior management turnover in 2020, with the departures of the previous managers of our sales team and our customer service teams during the third quarter of 2020. We believe we have successfully restructured these teams and have promoted a talented and experienced new leader for the restructured teams from within our ranks.\nFollowing our recent restructuring efforts, we believe that we have better aligned our human capital resources with the current and planned needs of our business. We are now focused on retaining and motivating our employees at all levels and in all parts of the organization, and we are committed to maintaining a workplace environment that promotes employee productivity and satisfaction. We do not expect to increase the size of our employee base significantly in the near future.\nCompensation, Benefits and Well-being\nWe believe that we offer fair compensation and benefits that support our employees\u2019 overall well-being and are competitive in our industry and in the communities in which we operate. To promote alignment with our short- and long-term objectives, our compensation practices for employees include base pay, annual bonuses and other short-term incentives, and equity grants and other opportunities for long-term incentives. We offer an array of benefits, including comprehensive health and wealth insurance. We provide emotional well-being services through an Employee Assistance Program.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes in 2020 that we determined were in the best interests of our company, our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. The vast majority of our employees have been working from home since March 2020 and will likely to continue to do so for at least the next few quarters. In addition, we reduced the salaries of all of our employees whose annual base salary was in excess of $100,000 by up to 10% for the period from June 1, 2020 until August 1, 2020, and we reduced the salaries of our senior executives by 20% from June 1, 2020 until August 1, 2020, which reduction was reduced to 10% from August 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020 and to 0% effective as of January 1, 2021. We have been very encouraged by how our employees have responded to the challenges that have stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic and have generally maintained their productivity under the evolving working conditions.\nCommunication and Engagement\nWe believe that our success depends upon on our employees understanding how their work contributes to our overall strategy and plans. To this end, we try to communicate with our workforce through a variety of channels and encourage open and direct communication, including quarterly company-wide CEO update meetings, regular company-wide call on a variety of topics of interest and frequent email corporate communications.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe strive to promote and advance diversity and inclusion across the country and we value diverse perspectives and life experiences. We believe that everyone deserves respect and equal treatment, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation gender identity cultural background or religious belief.\nIntellectual Property\nOur intellectual property rights are a key component of our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had four issued patents and one patent application pending in the United States. We own and use trademarks on or in connection with our products and services, including two registered trademarks in the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, China, Japan and Russia; one registered mark in South Korea and Singapore; and unregistered common law marks and pending trademark applications in the United States, Canada and the European Union. We have also registered numerous Internet domain names.\nAvailable Information\nThe mailing address of our headquarters is 123 Mission Street, 27th Floor, San Francisco, California 94105 and our telephone number at that location is (415) 399-2580.

Our platform is an analytics, workflow and optimization solution for marketing professionals, enabling them to effectively manage their digital advertising spend. We market and sell our solutions to advertisers directly and through leading advertising agencies, and our customers collectively manage billions of dollars in advertising spend on our platform globally across a wide range of industries. We believe this makes us one of the largest providers of independent advertising cloud solutions. Our software solution is designed to help our customers:\n\u2022\nmeasure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns through our proprietary reporting and analytics capabilities;\n\u2022\nmanage and execute campaigns through our intuitive user interface and underlying technology that streamlines and automates key functions, such as advertisement creation and bidding, across multiple publishers and channels; and\n\u2022\noptimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels based on market and business data to achieve desired revenue outcomes using our predictive bid management technology.\nOur current product lineup consists of MarinOne and our two legacy products, Marin Search and Marin Social. We have been migrating customers, and we expect to continue to migrate customers in the first half of 2021, from Marin Search and Marin Social to MarinOne.\n\u2022\nMarinOne. Our next-generation solution brings search, social and eCommerce advertising into a single-platform that helps advertisers maximize a customer journey that spans Google, Facebook, Twitter and Amazon by combining the power of Marin Search and Marin Social with new channels like LinkedIn, Apple Search Ads and YouTube.\n\u2022\nMarin Search. Our original solution for large advertisers and agencies, Marin Search is designed to provide search advertisers with the power, scale and flexibility required to manage large-scale advertising campaigns.\n\u2022\nMarin Social. Helps advertisers manage their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter advertising spend at scale.\nAdvertisers use our platform to create, target and convert precise audiences based on recent buying signals from users\u2019 search, social and eCommerce interactions. Our platform is integrated with leading publishers such as Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Bing, Facebook, Google, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Verizon Media, Yahoo! Japan and Yandex. Additionally, we have integrations with more than 50 leading web analytics and advertisement-serving solutions and key enterprise applications, enabling our customers to more accurately measure the return on investment of their marketing programs.\nOur software platform serves as an integration point for advertising performance, sales and revenue data, allowing advertisers to connect the dots between advertising spend and revenue outcomes. Through an intuitive interface, we enable our customers to simultaneously run large-scale digital advertising campaigns across multiple publishers and channels, making it easy for marketers to create, publish, modify and optimize campaigns.\nOur predictive bid management and optimization technology also allows advertisers to forecast outcomes and optimize campaigns across multiple publishers and channels to achieve their business goals. Our optimization technology can help advertisers increase advertisement spend on those campaigns, publishers and channels that are performing well while reducing investment in\nthose that are not. This category of solutions, which we refer to as cross-channel bid and campaign optimization, helps businesses intelligently and efficiently measure, manage, and optimize their digital advertising spend to achieve desired business results.\nIn December 2019, the novel coronavirus causing the disease COVID-19 was reported in China and in March 2020 the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have an adverse impact on many of our customers and their businesses and their spending on digital advertising and has had an adverse impact on our recent results of operations and is likely to continue to affect our future results of operations. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including containment of COVID-19, the availability, deployment and efficacy of vaccines, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, and impact on our employees, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this time, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. Since mid-March 2020, some of our customers have reduced the amount of digital advertising spend that they manage using our product which has had an adverse effect on our results of operations and some of our customers have requested extended payment terms, reduced fees or fee waivers, early contract terminations and other forms of contract relief. Also, since mid-March 2020 most of our employees have not been able to work from our offices and have been working from home, which could cause some disruptions or delays in our business activities, including our product development efforts.\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, the Company commenced the implementation of a restructuring and reduction-in-force plan to reduce the Company\u2019s operating costs and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is ultimately expected to result in the reduction of the Company\u2019s global workforce by approximately 60 employees, approximately half of which are located outside of the United States (\u201c2020 Restructuring Plan\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, the majority of the planned workforce reductions were complete with the remainder expected to be completed over the next few quarters.\nIn November 2019, we divested the assets and liabilities related to our Perfect Audience business, which focused on display retargeting advertisements, to an unrelated third party for net proceeds of $4.3 million. We believe this transaction will allow us to focus on our enterprise brands across search, social and eCommerce advertising. This transaction is described more fully in Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues, Net\nWe generate revenues principally from subscription contracts under which we provide advertisers with access to our search, social and eCommerce advertising management platform, either directly or through the advertiser\u2019s relationship with an agency with whom we have a contract. Our subscription contracts are generally one year or less in length. Under subscription contracts with most of our direct advertisers and some independent agencies, we generally charge fees based on the amount of advertising spend that these customers manage through our platform or a contractual minimum monthly platform fee, whichever is greater. Certain of these customers are charged only a fixed monthly platform fee. Most of our subscription contracts with our network agency customers do not include a committed minimum monthly platform fee, and we charge fees based upon the amount of advertising spend that these customers manage through our platform. Due to the nature of the platform and the services performed under the subscription agreements, revenues are typically recognized in the amount billable to the advertiser.\nOur long-term strategic agreements have historically included multiple-year terms and are invoiced quarterly. Our largest agreement with Google was entered into in December 2018 with an effective date of October 1, 2018 (the \u201cGoogle Revenue Share Agreement\u201d) and includes both a fixed baseline amount and a variable portion based on a percentage of relevant advertising search spend above the baseline threshold that runs through our technology platform. The Google Revenue Share Agreement has a three-year term; however, until March 2020, when we and Google executed the first amendment to the original agreement (the \u201cFirst Amendment\u201d), Google could terminate the Google Revenue Share Agreement after two years, with no penalty if we did not meet certain financial metrics. Accordingly, the Company accounted for the Google Revenue Share Agreement as a two-year agreement with one optional renewal year. The revenue impact of the third year is being accounted for prospectively from the date of the First Amendment. Our other long-term strategic agreements are generally variable in nature, based on a percentage of relevant search advertising spend that runs through our technology platform.\nThe majority of our revenues are derived from advertisers based in the United States. Advertisers from outside of the United States represented 25% of total revenues for both 2020 and 2019. The Google Revenue Share Agreement accounted for approximately 31% of our revenues in 2020 and approximately 25% in 2019.\nRefer to Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition considerations.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues primarily includes personnel costs, consisting of salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation expense for employees associated with our cloud infrastructure and global services for implementation and ongoing customer service. Other costs of revenues include fees paid to contractors who supplement our support and data center personnel, expenses related to third-party data centers, depreciation of data center equipment, amortization of internally developed software, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. Incremental cost of revenues associated with our long-term strategic agreements, including our largest agreement with Google, are generally not significant.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses, as well as sales commissions and other costs including travel and entertainment, marketing and promotional events, lead generation activities, public relations, marketing activities, professional fees, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead. All of these costs are expensed as incurred, except sales commissions and the related payroll taxes, which are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of benefit in accordance with the relevant authoritative accounting guidance (refer to Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements). Our commission plans provide that commission payments to our sales representatives are paid based on the key components of the applicable customer contract, including the minimum or fixed monthly platform fee during the initial contract term.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our product development and engineering employees and executives, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses. Also included are non-personnel costs such as professional fees payable to third-party development resources, amortization of intangible assets and allocated overhead.\nOur research and development efforts are focused on enhancing our software architecture, adding new features and functionality to our platform and improving the efficiency with which we deliver these services to our customers, including the development of MarinOne.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation expense and bonuses for our administrative, legal, human resources, finance and accounting employees and executives. Also included are non-personnel costs, such as audit fees, tax services and legal fees, as well as professional fees, insurance and other corporate expenses, including allocated overhead.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nIn November 2019, we performed an impairment assessment of goodwill utilizing the simplified method which resulted in an impairment of goodwill of $1.9 million at that time, reducing the goodwill balance to zero\nGain on Divestiture\nThe gain on divestiture related to the divestiture of the assets and liabilities of our Perfect Audience business to unrelated third party SharpSpring, Inc. in November 2019. It represents the difference between net proceeds received and the net liabilities of Perfect Audience that were transferred to SharpSpring, Inc.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net, primarily consists of sublease income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses, as well as interest income earned on our cash equivalents offset by the interest expense related to our outstanding note payable and finance lease liabilities.\nBenefit from Income Taxes\nThe benefit from income taxes consists of federal, state and foreign income taxes. Due to recent losses, we maintain a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2020. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our deferred tax assets.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table is a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the specified periods and results of operations as a percentage of revenues for those periods. The period-to-period comparisons of results are not necessarily indicative of results for future periods. Percentage of revenues figures are rounded and therefore may not subtotal exactly.\nA discussion regarding our consolidated statements of operations and results of operations as a percentage of revenue for 2020 compared to 2019 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 23, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov.\nYears Ended December 31,\nAmount\n% of\nRevenue\nAmount\n% of\nRevenue\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenues, net\n$\n29,983\n%\n$\n49,036\n%\nCost of revenues (1) (2) (3)\n17,946\n22,843\nGross profit\n12,037\n26,193\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing (1) (2) (3)\n6,958\n15,836\nResearch and development (1) (2) (3)\n12,815\n17,845\nGeneral and administrative (1) (2) (3)\n8,559\n10,446\nImpairment of goodwill\n-\n-\n1,910\nTotal operating expenses\n28,332\n46,037\nLoss from operations\n(16,295\n)\n(54\n)\n(19,844\n)\n(40\n)\nGain on divestiture\n-\n-\n5,064\nOther income, net\n1,533\n2,252\nLoss before benefit from income taxes\n(14,762\n)\n(49\n)\n(12,528\n)\n(26\n)\nBenefit from income taxes\n(711\n)\n(2\n)\n(120\n)\n-\nNet loss\n$\n(14,051\n)\n(47\n)\n%\n$\n(12,408\n)\n(25\n)\n%\n(1)\nStock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations data above was as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenues\n$\n$\nSales and marketing\nResearch and development\n1,025\nGeneral and administrative\n$\n1,494\n$\n2,664\n(2)\nAmortization of intangible assets included in the consolidated statements of operations data above was as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenues\n$\n$\nSales and marketing\n-\nResearch and development\nGeneral and administrative\n-\n-\n$\n$\n1,814\n(3)\nRestructuring-related expenses included in the consolidated statements of operations data above were as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenues\n$\n$\nSales and marketing\nResearch and development\n-\nGeneral and administrative\n-\n$\n1,176\n$\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated revenues by geographic area, as well as the related percentages of total revenues, for the specified periods.\nYears Ended December 31,\nAmount\n% of\nRevenue\nAmount\n% of\nRevenue\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenues, net by geography\nUnited States of America\n$\n22,409\n%\n$\n36,718\n%\nUnited Kingdom\n3,905\n5,489\nOther\n3,669\n6,829\nTotal revenues, net\n$\n29,983\n%\n$\n49,036\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, the amortization of internally developed software, intangible assets, the capitalization of internally developed software, the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, interest expense, net, the benefit from or provision for income taxes, other income or expenses, net and the non-recurring costs or gains associated with acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss, operating loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We prepare Adjusted EBITDA to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. Investors are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons:\n\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company\u2019s operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, capitalized software development costs, interest expense, net, benefit from or provision for income taxes, other income or expenses, net and costs or gains associated with acquisitions, divestitures and restructurings, that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired;\n\u2022\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of operating performance and the effectiveness of our business strategies and in communications with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance; and\n\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of operations and also facilitates comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\nWe understand that although Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, it has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported under GAAP. These limitations include:\n\u2022\nDepreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future; however, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements;\n\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments;\n\u2022\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for income taxes and the cash impact of other income or expense; and\n\u2022\nOther companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss, the most comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nNet loss\n$\n(14,051\n)\n$\n(12,408\n)\nDepreciation\n1,924\n1,934\nAmortization of internally developed software\n2,984\n3,904\nAmortization of intangible assets\n1,814\nBenefit from income taxes\n(711\n)\n(120\n)\nImpairment of goodwill\n-\n1,910\nStock-based compensation expense\n1,494\n2,664\nCapitalization of internally developed software costs\n(1,869\n)\n(2,056\n)\nRestructuring related expenses\n1,176\nGain on divestiture\n-\n(5,064\n)\nOther income, net\n(1,533\n)\n(2,252\n)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n(10,491\n)\n$\n(9,177\n)\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenues, Net\nYears Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenues, net\n$\n29,983\n$\n49,036\n$\n(19,053\n)\n(39\n)\n%\nRevenues, net in 2020 decreased by $19.1 million, or 39%, as compared to 2019. During 2020, we experienced ongoing customer turnover that was only partially offset by new customer bookings. Since mid-March 2020, some of our customers have reduced the amount of digital advertising spend that they manage using our product due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, in November 2019, we divested our Perfect Audience business which contributed $2.5 million of revenues, net in 2019. Revenues, net in 2020 and 2019 are inclusive of $9.1 million and $12.2 million, respectively, from the Google Revenue Share Agreement, as described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenues, net in 2020 and 2019 from our customers located in the United States represented 75% of total revenues in both years. The Google Revenue Share Agreement accounted for 31% and 25% of total revenues, net for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\nYears Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nCost of revenues\n$\n17,946\n$\n22,843\n$\n(4,897\n)\n(21\n)\n%\nGross profit\n12,037\n26,193\n(14,156\n)\n(54\n)\nGross margin\n%\n%\nCost of revenues in 2020 decreased by $4.9 million, or 21%, as compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of global services and cloud infrastructure personnel, which led to a decrease of $1.9 million in compensation and benefits expense, including stock-based compensation expense, as compared to 2019. This reduction in headcount also contributed to a decrease in allocated facilities and information technology costs of $0.5 million in 2020. We experienced a decrease of $0.9 million in hosting costs in 2020 due to a decline in usage of our hosting platform, and a decrease in the amortization of intangible assets of $0.8 million as our remaining intangible assets became fully amortized in the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, amortization of internally developed software costs decreased by $0.9 million in 2020, due primarily to the timing of the capitalization of certain internal projects as compared to 2019. Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of $0.4 million in restructuring costs in 2020 related to our 2020 Restructuring Plan.\nWe expect cost of revenues to decrease in the near term in absolute dollars as savings from the 2020 Restructuring Plan are realized and we continue our efforts to realign our cost structure with our revenues.\nOur gross margin decreased to 40% during 2020, as compared to 53% during 2019. This was primarily due to our revenues, net, declining at a faster rate than the corresponding decrease in costs, in part due to the timing of revenue recognition from the Google Revenue Share Agreement.\nSales and Marketing\nYears Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nSales and marketing\n$\n6,958\n$\n15,836\n$\n(8,878\n)\n(56\n)\n%\nPercent of revenues, net\n%\n%\nSales and marketing expenses in 2020 decreased by $8.9 million, or 56%, as compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the global sales support and marketing headcount, including reductions that were part of our restructuring activities during 2020, contributing to net decreases of $5.9 million in personnel-related costs, and $1.5 million in allocated facilities and information technology costs as compared to 2019. Additionally, our marketing costs decreased by $1.1 million, as we eliminated or shifted the timing of certain of our marketing activities.\nWe expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease in the near term in absolute dollars as savings from the 2020 Restructuring Plan are realized and we continue our efforts to realign our cost structure with our revenues.\nResearch and Development\nYears Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nResearch and development\n$\n12,815\n$\n17,845\n$\n(5,030\n)\n(28\n)\n%\nPercent of revenues, net\n%\n%\nResearch and development expenses in 2020 decreased by $5.0 million, or 28%, as compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of full-time research and development personnel, resulting in a decrease of $3.5 million in compensation expense and $0.6 million in allocated facilities and information technology costs as compared to 2019. Additionally, amortization of intangible assets decreased by $0.8 million as our remaining intangible assets became fully amortized in the first quarter of 2020.\nWe expect research and development expenses to decrease in the near term in absolute dollars as savings from the 2020 Restructuring Plan are realized and we continue our efforts to realign our cost structure with our revenues.\nGeneral and Administrative\nYears Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nGeneral and administrative\n$\n8,559\n$\n10,446\n$\n(1,887\n)\n(18\n)\n%\nPercent of revenues, net\n%\n%\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2020 decreased by $1.9 million, or 18%, as compared to 2019. Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $1.7 million in 2020, primarily due to a reduction in headcount. Also contributing to the decrease were lower professional fees of $0.5 million as we reduced the number of contractors and the scope of our activities with consultants and other advisors.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease in the near term in absolute dollars as savings from the 2020 Restructuring Plan are realized and we continue our efforts to realign our cost structure with our revenues.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nYears Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nImpairment of goodwill\n$\n-\n$\n1,910\n$\n(1,910\n)\n(100\n)\n%\nPercent of revenues, net\n-\n%\n%\nWe recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, reducing the goodwill balance to zero at that time.

Refer to Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on this gain on divestiture.\nOther Income, Net\nYears Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nOther income, net\n$\n1,533\n$\n2,252\n$\n(719\n)\n(32\n)\n%\nOther income, net, primarily consists of sublease income recorded under agreements for portions of our San Francisco and Portland office spaces, with terms through July 2022 and May 2020, respectively, as well as foreign currency transaction gains and losses and interest income and expense. In 2020, we generated sublease income of $1.7 million, as compared to $2.3 million in 2019. Foreign currency transaction losses and interest expense were each less than $0.1 million in both 2020 and 2019.\n(Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes\nYears Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nBenefit from income taxes\n$\n(711\n)\n$\n(120\n)\n$\n(591\n)\n%\nThe benefit from income taxes in 2020 totaled $0.7 million, as compared to a benefit for income taxes of $0.1 million in 2019.

We have prepared the quarterly data on a basis consistent with our audited annual financial statements, including, in the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the financial information contained in these statements. The historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands)\nRevenues, net\n$\n7,252\n$\n6,796\n$\n7,275\n$\n8,660\n$\n11,384\n$\n11,728\n$\n12,476\n$\n13,448\nCost of revenues (1) (2) (3)\n3,693\n4,323\n4,585\n5,345\n5,536\n5,567\n5,929\n5,811\nGross profit\n3,559\n2,473\n2,690\n3,315\n5,848\n6,161\n6,547\n7,637\nOperating expenses\nSales and marketing (1) (2) (3)\n1,275\n1,491\n1,880\n2,312\n3,383\n3,732\n4,087\n4,634\nResearch and development (1) (2) (3)\n2,934\n3,106\n3,338\n3,437\n4,418\n3,872\n4,660\n4,895\nGeneral and administrative (1) (2) (3)\n2,436\n2,131\n2,011\n1,981\n2,317\n2,631\n2,277\n3,221\nImpairment of goodwill\n-\n-\n-\n-\n1,910\n-\n-\n-\nTotal operating expenses\n6,645\n6,728\n7,229\n7,730\n12,028\n10,235\n11,024\n12,750\nLoss from operations\n(3,086\n)\n(4,255\n)\n(4,539\n)\n(4,415\n)\n(6,180\n)\n(4,074\n)\n(4,477\n)\n(5,113\n)\nGain on divestiture\n-\n-\n-\n-\n5,064\n-\n-\n-\nOther income, net\nLoss before (benefit from) provision for income taxes\n(2,670\n)\n(4,144\n)\n(4,002\n)\n(3,946\n)\n(576\n)\n(3,434\n)\n(3,945\n)\n(4,573\n)\n(Benefit from) provision for income taxes\n(143\n)\n(72\n)\n(521\n)\n(50\n)\n(161\n)\nNet loss\n$\n(2,527\n)\n$\n(4,072\n)\n$\n(3,481\n)\n$\n(3,971\n)\n$\n(526\n)\n$\n(3,273\n)\n$\n(4,003\n)\n$\n(4,606\n)\nNet loss per share available to common stockholders, basic and diluted\n$\n(0.29\n)\n$\n(0.58\n)\n$\n(0.50\n)\n$\n(0.58\n)\n$\n(0.08\n)\n$\n(0.49\n)\n$\n(0.65\n)\n$\n(0.77\n)\n(1)\nStock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations data above was as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenues\n$\n$\n(19\n)\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nSales and marketing\nResearch and development\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal stock-based compensation expense\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(2)\nAmortization of intangible assets included in the consolidated statements of operations data above was as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenues\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\nSales and marketing\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nResearch and development\n-\n-\n-\nGeneral and administrative\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal amortization of intangible assets\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n(3)\nRestructuring-related expenses included in the consolidated statements of operations data above were as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenues\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n(7\n)\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nSales and marketing\n-\n-\nResearch and development\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nGeneral and administrative\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal restructuring related expenses\n$\n$\n1,051\n-\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the specified periods as a percentage of our revenues for those periods.

From incorporation until our initial public offering, or the IPO, we raised $105.7 million, net of related issuance costs, in funding through private placements of our preferred stock. In March and April 2013, we raised net proceeds of $109.3 million in our IPO. In 2019 and 2020 we raised total net proceeds of $9.4 million from an at-the-market offering program administered by JMP Securities and in 2020 we received proceeds of $3.3 million from a loan through the Paycheck Protection Program. From time to time, we have also utilized equipment lines and entered into finance lease arrangements to fund capital purchases. As of December 31, 2020, our principal source of liquidity was our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $14.3 million. Our primary operating cash requirements include the payment of compensation and other employee-related expenses, as well as costs for our facilities and information technology infrastructure.\nWe maintain a $0.4 million irrevocable letter of credit to secure the non-cancelable lease for our corporate headquarters in San Francisco and a $0.1 million irrevocable letter of credit to secure the non-cancelable lease for our office in Paris. These balances are reflected as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We maintain cash balances in our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, we had $14.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in aggregate, of which $1.2 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, which instituted fundamental changes to the taxation of multinational corporations. Among these changes is a mandatory one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries, and a tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries in excess of a specified return on the subsidiaries' tangible assets, known as the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI. We completed our analysis of the accounting for the transition tax in the fourth quarter of 2018 and there was no tax due as a result of significant accumulated losses in our foreign subsidiaries. We also determined that no GILTI inclusion would be required in 2019 or 2020 as our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated significant losses. If funds held by our foreign subsidiaries were needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue U.S. tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of these funds. However, given the amount of our net operating loss carryovers in the United States, such repatriation will most likely not result in material U.S. cash tax payments within the next year. Additionally, we do not believe that foreign withholding taxes associated with repatriating these funds would be material.\nOn March 14, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on May 10, 2019, under which we may offer our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, subscription rights and\nunits having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million. As part of the shelf registration statement, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities LLC under which we could offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $13.0 million through an at-the-market offering program administered by JMP Securities. We were not required to sell any of our stock under this program. JMP Securities was entitled to compensation of up to 5.0% of the gross proceeds from sales of our common stock pursuant to the equity distribution agreement. We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of securities under the equity distribution agreement primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 2.7 million shares of our common stock under the equity distribution agreement, and received proceeds of $7.5 million, net of offering costs of $0.5 million, at a weighted average sales price of $2.92 per share. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 0.7 million shares of our common stock under the equity distribution agreement, and received proceeds of $1.6 million, net of offering costs of $0.2 million, at a weighted average sales price of $2.82 per share. During February 2021 we sold an additional 1.2 million shares of our common stock under the equity distribution agreement and received proceeds of $3.1 million, net of offering costs of $0.1 million, at a weighted average sales price of $2.68 per share. There are currently no additional amounts available to be sold under this equity distribution agreement.\nIn May 2020, we entered into a loan agreement with a lender for the loan in an aggregate principal amount of $3.3 million (the \u201cLoan\u201d) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. We received the Loan proceeds on May 12, 2020. We expect to apply for forgiveness of approximately $2.9 million due under the Loan once the Lender opens the application process, but no assurances can be provided as to the amount or timing of any potential Loan forgiveness. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this loan.\nWe have incurred significant losses in each fiscal year since our incorporation in 2006, and we expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows in the future. Based on our current and anticipated level of operations, including our internal forecasts and projections, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Our ability to achieve our business objectives and to continue to meet our obligations is dependent upon maintaining a certain level of liquidity, which could be impacted by several factors, including the extent of customer acceptance and adoption of our new MarinOne platform and other market conditions and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and continues to disrupt economic markets and the full economic impact, duration and spread of COVID-19 is uncertain at this time and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape. Since mid-March 2020, some of our customers have reduced the amount of digital advertising spend that they manage using our products, which has had an adverse effect on our results of operations, and some of our customers have requested extended payment terms, reduced fees or fee waivers, early contract terminations and other forms of contract relief. Although we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue additional sources of liquidity, including additional equity and debt financing, there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. During the second half of 2020, we commenced a restructuring plan that included a global reduction-in-force and other cost saving actions to reduce our operating expenses and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business (the \u201c2020 Restructuring Plan\u201d). The 2020 Restructuring Plan is expected to ultimately result in the reduction of our global workforce by approximately 60 employees, approximately half of which are located outside of the United States. We completed the majority of the workforce reductions during 2020 and recognized $1.2 million in restructuring charges. Our ability to continue as a going concern is substantially dependent upon our ability to improve customer retention rates, increase new bookings, and manage our cash flows. Other factors that may significantly affect our ability to continue as a going concern include one or more of the following; our ability to obtain partial forgiveness of our loan under the Paycheck Protection Program, our ability to renew our revenue sharing agreement with Google on acceptable terms, our ability to raise additional financing, and our ability to further reduce our expenses.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nNet cash used in operating activities\n$\n(5,675\n)\n$\n(1,236\n)\nNet cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n(1,884\n)\n1,607\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n10,233\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n(29\n)\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n2,715\n$\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities is primarily influenced by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the operation of our business and the fluctuations in the number of advertisers using our platform. Cash used in operating activities has typically been affected by net losses and further increased by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly in the areas of accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and deferred income tax benefits.\nCash used in operating activities in 2020 of $5.7 million was primarily the result of a net loss of $14.1 million, which was partially offset by non-cash expenses of $6.8 million, primarily consisting of depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, provision for bad debts and net changes in operating leases, and a $1.6 million net change in working capital items. These items consisted most notably of (1) a decrease in accounts receivable of $4.1 million due to the decrease in revenues and the timing of related collections and (2) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities (both current and non-current) of $2.5 million due to the timing of related disbursements and lower accrued payroll-related costs driven by lower headcount.\nCash used in operating activities in 2019 of $1.2 million was primarily the result of a net loss of $12.4 million, which was not fully offset by non-cash expenses of $7.6 million, primarily consisting of impairment of goodwill, depreciation, amortization, gain on divestiture of Perfect Audience, stock-based compensation expense, provision for bad debts and net changes in operating leases, and a $3.6 million net change in working capital items. These items consisted most notably of (1) a decrease in accounts receivable of $4.2 million due to the decrease in revenues and the timing of related collections; (2) a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets (both current and non-current) of $0.2 million due to the timing of related disbursements; and (3) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities (both current and non-current) of $0.8 million due to the timing of related disbursements.\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2020, investing activities primarily consisted of $1.9 million of capitalized internally developed software costs. In 2019 investing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds from the divestiture of Perfect Audience. Capital expenditures may vary from period-to-period due to the timing of our operational requirements and the development cycles of our internally-developed hosted software platform. We expect to continue to invest in the development of our software platform for the foreseeable future.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $10.2 million. This primarily consisted of $7.7 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of common shares pursuant to our equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities and $3.3 million net proceeds from our Loan pursuant to the PPP under the CARES Act, partially offset by $0.6 million of net repayments under our right-of-use finance lease liabilities and $0.2 million in employee taxes paid for withheld shares upon the settlement of equity awards.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2019 was $0.3 million. This was primarily due to $1.6 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common shares pursuant to our equity distribution agreement with JMP Securities and $0.1 million of proceeds from net contributions to the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or 2013 ESPP, offset by $1.2 million of net repayments under our right-of-use finance lease liabilities and $0.3 million in employee taxes paid for withheld shares upon the settlement of equity awards.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of operating leases for office space, net of sublease income. As of December 31, 2020, the future minimum payments under these commitments, were as follows:\nPayments Due By Period\nTotal\nWithin 1\nYear\n1 - 3\nYears\n3 - 5\nYears\nMore Than\n5 Years\n(in thousands)\nNote payable\n$\n3,320\n$\n1,854\n$\n1,466\n$\n-\n$\n-\nFinance lease obligations\n-\n-\n-\nOperating leases obligations\n8,962\n7,117\n1,845\n-\n-\nSublease income\n(1,721\n)\n(1,105\n)\n(616\n)\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n10,576\n$\n7,881\n$\n2,695\n$\n-\n$\n-\nThe amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding, which specify significant terms including payment terms, related services and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table.\nThe note payable relates to our loan pursuant to the PPP under the CARES Act. We expect to apply for forgiveness of approximately $2.9 million due under the loan once the Lender opens the application process, but no assurances can be provided as to the amount or timing of any potential loan forgiveness. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this loan.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions within certain of our contracts. Pursuant to these arrangements, we may be obligated to indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally parties with which we have commercial relations, in connection with certain intellectual\nproperty infringement claims by any third party with respect to our software. To date, there have not been any costs incurred in connection with such indemnification arrangements and therefore, there is no accrual for such amounts as of December 31, 2020.\nIn addition to the obligations in the table above, we have approximately $1.4 million of uncertain tax positions that have been recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2020. It is uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We are therefore not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships.\nWe have no obligations that meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement as of December 31, 2020, other than operating leases and related subleases, as described in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements, and the irrevocable letter of credit described above.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future.\nSince March 2020, we have undertaken measures to protect our employees and customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There can be no assurance that these measures will be effective, however, or that we can adopt them without adversely affecting our business operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in global financial markets, which may decrease technology spending, depress demand for our platform and harm our business and results of operations.\nOur estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected. See \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for certain matters that may affect these estimates or our future financial condition or results of operations. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if the changes in estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of judgment by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and, accordingly, we believe the policies described below are the most critical for understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenues principally from subscriptions either directly with advertisers or with advertising agencies to our platform for the management of search, social and eCommerce advertising. Revenue is recognized when control of these advertising management services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u2022\nDetermination of the transaction price;\n\u2022\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\nOur subscription contracts provide advertisers with access to the Company's advertising management platform. Advertisers do not have the right to take possession of the software supporting the services at any time. These contracts are generally one year or less in length. The subscription fee under most contracts consists of the greater of a minimum monthly platform fee or variable consideration based on the volume of advertising spend managed through our platform at the contractual percentage of spend. The variable portion generally includes tiered pricing, whereby the percentage of spend charged decreases as the value of advertising spend increases. The tiered pricing resets monthly and is consistent throughout the contract term. We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the pricing tiers are consistent throughout the contract term and similar pricing is typically offered to similar classes of customers within the same geographical areas and markets. Certain subscription contracts consist of only a flat monthly platform fee. Subscription fees are generally invoiced on a monthly basis in arrears based on the actual amount of advertising spend managed on the platform. In certain limited circumstances we will invoice an advertiser in advance for the contractual minimum monthly platform fee for a defined future period, which is typically three to 12 months.\nOur subscription services comprise a single stand-ready performance obligation satisfied over time, as the advertiser simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit from our performance. This performance obligation constitutes a series of services that are substantially the same and provided over time using the same measure of progress. Revenues derived from these arrangements are recognized over time using an output method based upon the passage of time as this provides a faithful depiction of the pattern of transfer of control. Fixed minimum monthly platform fees are recognized ratably over the contract term as the single performance obligation is satisfied. Variable fees are allocated to the distinct month of the series in which they are earned because the terms of the variable payments relate specifically to the outcome from transferring the distinct time increment (month) of service and because such amounts reflect the fees to which we expect to be entitled for providing access to the advertising management platform for that period, consistent with the allocation objective of authoritative revenue recognition guidance.\nWe have also entered into long-term strategic agreements with certain leading search publishers. Under these strategic agreements, we receive consideration based on a percentage of the search advertising spend that our customers manage on our platform. These strategic agreements are generally billed on a quarterly basis. The majority of the strategic agreement revenue is concentrated to one revenue share agreement, executed with Google in December 2018, but with an effective date of October 1, 2018. Under this agreement, which constitutes a single performance obligation, we receive both fixed and variable revenue share payments based on a percentage of the search advertising spend that is managed through our platform. The agreement requires us to reinvest a specified percentage of these revenue share payments to drive our search technology platform innovation. The performance obligation is satisfied over time ratably over the contractual term of two years, since Google simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit from our performance, using an output method based upon the passage of time. We believe this provides a faithful depiction of the pattern of transfer of control. The agreement carries a three-year term; however, until March 2020, when we and Google executed the first amendment to the agreement, the term was cancellable by Google after two years with no penalty if we did not meet certain financial metrics, and, therefore, we historically evaluated the agreement as a two-year agreement with one optional renewal year. We are accounting for the impact of the third year prospectively as of the date of execution of the first amendment.\nWe evaluate the total amount of variable revenue share payments expected to be earned from this agreement by using the expected value method, as we believe this method represents the most appropriate estimate for this consideration, based on historical service trends, the individual contract considerations and our best judgment at the time. We include estimates of variable consideration in revenues only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We expect that in the future, revenues from strategic agreements will continue to grow as a percentage of our total revenues, net.\nWe capitalize certain contract acquisition and fulfillment costs and amortize those costs based on the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be 30 months. This period of benefit was determined by taking into consideration the duration of our customer contracts, historical contract renewal rates, the underlying platform technology and other factors.\nAt the inception of a customer contract, we make an assessment as to that customer's ability to pay for the services provided in order to determine whether collectability is probable and a contract exists for revenue recognition purposes. We assess collectability based on a number of factors, including credit worthiness of the customer along with past transaction history. In addition, we perform periodic evaluations of our customers' financial condition. Certain contracts with advertising agencies contain sequential liability provisions, where the agency does not have an obligation to pay until payment is received from the agency\u2019s customers. In these circumstances, we evaluate the credit worthiness of the agency\u2019s customers, in addition to the agency itself.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a result of our current net operating loss position in the United States, income tax expense consists primarily of corporate income taxes resulting from profits generated in foreign jurisdictions by wholly owned subsidiaries, along with state income taxes payable in the United States. As we have incurred operating losses in all periods to date and recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets (except for deferred tax assets associated with certain of our foreign subsidiaries), we have not historically recorded a provision for U.S. federal income taxes. Realization of any of our deferred tax assets depends upon future earnings, the timing and amount of which are uncertain. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the extent to which a valuation allowance should be applied against our deferred tax assets.\nUtilization of our net operating losses may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Code and similar state provisions. We last assessed the application of Internal Revenue Code Section 382 during the fourth quarter of 2017, and concluded no limitation applied. We have monitored equity transactions in the periods since the fourth quarter of 2017 and have found no circumstances which would result in a significant change in our stock ownership. In the event we have subsequent changes in ownership or profitability is delayed, net operating losses and research and development credit carryovers could be further limited and may expire unutilized.\nAccounts Receivable and Related Reserves\nWe record accounts receivable at the invoiced amounts, and these receivables do not bear interest. We record reserves as a reduction of our accounts receivable balance for doubtful accounts and revenue credits. Estimates are required to determine both of these reserves.\nOur allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence. When collection of an outstanding balance is no longer probable, we will either partially or fully write-off the balance against the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts charges are included as a component of general and administrative expenses. Our reserve for revenue credits relates to service credits that are expected to be issued to customers during the ordinary course of business. These credits typically relate to customer disputes and billing adjustments and are recorded as reductions to revenues, net. Reserves for revenue credits are accounted for as variable consideration under authoritative revenue recognition guidance and are estimated using the expected value method based on an analysis of credits issued in previous periods. These estimates could change significantly for various reasons, including changes in our customers' financial condition, interruptions to our platform or deterioration in the economy.\nOther Long-Lived Assets -- Impairment Assessments\nWe periodically review the carrying amounts of other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amount of such assets (or asset group) to the future undiscounted cash flow we expect the assets (or asset group) to generate. If we consider any of these assets to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist.\nEach period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of other long-lived assets to assess whether a revision to the remaining periods of amortization is required. Assumptions and estimates about remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy. Although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results. We did not recognize any long-lived asset impairment charges to date.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee \u201cNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.",

    "item_1": "Item 1. Business Factors\nHistory\nThe Company was formed in Delaware on June 5, 2006 as Caddystats, Inc.\nOn March 3, 2009, the Company acquired all of the voting shares of Roadships Holdings, Inc., a Florida Corporation, and Roadships America, Inc., also a Florida Corporation in exchange for an aggregate of 16,025,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. On March 4, 2009, the Company changed its name to Roadships Holdings, Inc.\nOn May 26, 2015, the Company acquired all the voting shares of Click Evidence Inc., an Arizona corporation. Effective November 2, 2015, the Company changed its name to Tautachrome Inc.\nOur Business\nTautachrome operates in the internet applications space, a large business space we believe to be uniquely able to make possible fast growing and novel business. The iPhone, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber and numerous other examples are reminders of the ability of the internet applications business space to surprise us with new business universes \u201cout of nowhere.\u201d A recent arrival in the internet applications space is blockchain technology, a technology empowering entities to create ecosystems of trade based on self-introduced and globally useable secure trading currencies. Blockchain technology has added a significant element to Tautachrome\u2019s business plans and activities. In addition, the subsequent development of a new patent pending technology dubbed ARknet technology that exploits augmented reality in a new solution to the purchasing interaction between global consumers and providers has been licensed by the Company for development.\nTautachrome is currently pursuing three main avenues of business activity based on our patented activated imaging technology, our blockchain trading currency, and the ARknet patent pending technology (together banded \u201cKlickZie\u201d technology):\n1.\nKlickZie ARknet technology business: Our licensed activity to develop and monetize a new augmented reality (\u201cAR\u201d) technology called \u201cARknet technology which permits goods and services providers to establish geolocated augmented reality interfaces, called ARks, allowing consumers to interact with inside info on the provider\u2019s products, specials and discounts with live purchasing provided. A provider\u2019s ARk may be located anywhere on earth, at a store location, or anywhere else the provider may desire. The ARknet is a fintech platform connecting consumers to providers in the global $48 trillion household purchasing market, using augmented reality as the medium of interaction.\n2.\nKlickZie\u2019s blockchain trading currency ecosystem: our recently added activity to create our own KlickZie blockchain and trading currency to incentivize consumer usage of the ARknet paltform, and\n3.\nKlickZie Activated Digital Imagery business: our longstanding flagship activity to develop and monetize downloadable apps based on our patented KlickZie trusted imaging technology and based on our patented trusted image-based social interactions using the pictures and videos that smartphone users generate on the web using their KlickZie imaging app.\n1. ARk Business Activity\nOn October 17, 2018, the Company licensed and is now developing the ARknet technology, a Fintech patent pending technology aimed at the global household goods and services market. ARks are floating interactive pictures (ARk Symbols) only visible around you in the Augmented Reality view provided by the ARknet app using the camera imager in your smartphone. ARks are intended for goods and service providers as a way to draw attention to customers in the vicinity of a provider\u2019s ARk Symbol. Shoppers and buyers seeing a Symbol can interact with the provider\u2019s goods or services via the ARk Symbol. The picture above is a shopping mall scene, where two stores, Claire\u2019s on your right, and rue 21 etc! on your left, are shown displaying interactive ARk symbols. Claire\u2019s ARk is a \u201cstandard\u201d ARk symbol, while rue 21 etc! uses a picture of their \u201cetc. Gold\u201d perfume product as their ARk symbol. Either way, using their smartphone imager an ARknet app users can touch the store\u2019s ARk Symbol and on their smartphone access the provider\u2019s Ark page containing interest-grabbing information, including pictures or videos of today\u2019s specials, in-ARk purchase and checkout features, reviews, links, menus, social media profiles or anything else the store wants to advertise.\nArks may be mobile ARks, using the app user\u2019s mobile device to mobilize the ARk location, or stationary ARks, using a set geo location determined by coordinates or determined by fixing the ARk location by moving the ARk owner\u2019s mobile device to a desired location and setting the stationary ARk\u2019s location there.\nProviders may create their ARks, decide on their ARk Symbol, choose their Symbol geolocations and provide for license payment to the Company, using features in the ARk app.\nWe intend the ARk app to be free to consumers and other users wishing to use the app to survey their environ for the presence of ARk symbols.\nWe envision a KlickZie ARknet with billions of users and ARks connecting humanity, commerce, information, crypto currency, and innovation in useful ways. Plus, we want to return the ownership of users\u2019 information and valuable items such as images and video, back to where it rightfully belongs, the individual user.\nFor additional information, visit https://myarknet.io.\n2. KlickZie blockchain trading currency\nIn late 2017 we formed a development team of providers to develop a KlickZie blockchain (branded the \u201czChain\u201d) to handle transactions using a cryptographically secured trading currency designated the \u201cKLK\u201d currency. The KLK is intended to be the currency of the imagery trading ecosystem allowing KlickZie users to monetize their pictures and videos and thereby enabling the ability to conduct widescale buying, selling and licensing of KlickZie pictures and videos.\nOur development team consists of individuals from the blockchain development company Kelecorix, Inc., and individuals from the image storage company Honeycomb Digital, LLC. The team has developed the software and architecture for the implementation of a simple KlickZie app that seeks to implement the ownership properties of KlickZie imaging.\nLike other blockchains, the zChain is intended to run in a decentralized manner. \u201cSmart contracts\u201d residing on the zChain would implement the buying, selling licensing and other trading features on the zChain. Such smart contracts would implement a commission on zChain transactions that involve participation by the Company to complete (for instance the certification of the validity of KlickZie imagery when requested).\nBecause KlickZie users own the imagery they create, the use of KlickZie imagery by others, including advertisers, could be done through the execution of a smart contract on the zChain transferring KLK currency from the advertiser to the user.\n3. KlickZie technology-based business activity\nTautachrome\u2019s KlickZie technology addresses two features of the internet age that create a new need and a new opportunity. The first is the need for a way to trust the pictures and videos you see on the web. Right now the trillions of pictures and frames of video on the web are so easily and often falsified that trustability of internet imagery is essentially zero. For this reason we believe that a universally available, downloadable system that turns the everyday pictures and videos we take from our smartphones into imagery that can be trustable to others seeing it, will have substantial value . We would like to see only two kinds of imagery come to exist on the web: imagery whose trustworthiness everybody can be certain of, and all the rest of the imagery for which the notion of trust is meaningless. The KlickZie system aims to satisfy the requirement of for universal trustability for the ordinary imagery it produces.\nThe technology required for trustability also opens the door to a new opportunity. This is the opportunity to enable people to use KlickZie pictures and videos on the web to readily and safely interact with each other via the imagery itself. It is frequently the case that when you run across interesting imagery on the web you cannot know anything about it, including who the author is, who else may have seen it, or what others may think or know about it. By allowing people to interact with interesting or important pictures or videos by using the imagery itself as the portal of communication, the KlickZie system can add the viewpoints and the information offerings of interacting people to the richness of pictures and videos. This can be carried by the system into the future along with the imagery, as an evolving information structure of interaction and imagery.\nKlickZie imaging Platform\nUsers will download KlickZie\u2019s free software into their mobile device (iPhone, Android or other smartphone). The software, an upgrade to the smartphone\u2019s camera software, will activate the pictures and videos taken by their device using proprietary KlickZie marking technology. Behind the scenes, KlickZie will capture the imagery and available metadata related to the imaging event, and mark the imagery and its metadata with advanced and invisible KlickZie marking technology.\nKlickZie activation seeks to add a new utility to ordinary pictures and videos. Other KlickZie users who come across an activated picture can communicate with the author of the picture, or with amenable others who have seen the picture or with the data stored in the picture by clicking or touching the picture (\u201ctouch-to-comm\u201d). We intend the picture itself by click or touch to make the communication happen no matter where or how you come across an activated picture.\nWhat happens to an activated picture from its creation onward is intended to be added to the picture\u2019s data for tracking into the future. Activated pictures seek to answer many questions. For example, in a group photo you could ask: Have any of the people in my contacts list interacted with this picture? Are any of them engaging it right now? Who else besides my contacts have already engaged this picture in some way? Who took it? Where? When?\nThe upshot is that activation seeks to allow effective touch to comm with the authors and viewers of smartphone pictures and videos, and to ensure that activated pictures and videos can be trusted.\nKlickZie Product Rollout\n\u00b7\nPhase 1: Build the minimal testable KlickZie system -including the Arknet app and trusted imaging app and the service cloud.\n\u00b7\nPhase 2: Release the KlickZie system into a limited audience to optimize user experience and user interfaces, to set up the KlickZie cloud for global scale up, and to plan global rollout.\n\u00b7\nPhase 3: Roll out the KlickZie system of ARks, trusted imaging, and the KLK trading currency, culture by culture and language by language, adding support staff and services as rollout moves forward.\nMonetizing\nAs presently conceived, the KlickZie product aims at revenues from four primary sources:\n\u00b7\nARk licensing fees paid by ARk-using providers\n\u00b7\nWell behaved advertising.\n\u00b7\nUser premium service fees.\n\u00b7\nEnterprise revenue paid by entities licensing our technologies for enterprise usages.\nFunding\nWe plan to continue raising funds to finance KlickZie product rollout.\nOngoing financing is currently being accomplished by equity sale, by incurring debt, and by other innovative means. There can be no assurances given that any of our funding efforts will be successful.\nFirst KlickZie revenues\nOur Plan of Operations for KlickZie based revenue looks for first revenues from ARk business app users coming on line within the first year after the receipt of funding sufficient to round out the KlickZie team. Preparations for other KlickZie revenue are geared for the two year and out timeframe.\nShelved business activity\nGeneral app development and digital design activities that were being carried out under our wholly-owned Polybia Studios subsidiary, and our acquisition activities that were being carried out under our Appquisitions Division have been shelved for the time being. Work on our PhotoSweep app has also been shelved in preference to a strict focusing on the KlickZie business activity.\nCompetition\nWith regard to the internet applications in general, competition is intense. According to Statista there are millions of smartphone applications available to users. In spaces that are this crowded the principal matter of competition is about capturing user mind space, which for a given product consists of elements such as degree of product exposure to users, degree of product apparent desirability, pleasure of product usage, and persisting necessity for the product in a user\u2019s life. These elements of competition are well known to our competitors which include the internet giants Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, all of whom have financial resources and operating staffs substantially larger than those of the Company, and all of whom can focus on the optimization of their products towards the same consumer and business arenas upon which we intend to focus.\nWith regard to the ARknet augmented reality space, while there is no direct competition in the space at the moment, that could change in a heartbeat with an interest taken by any of the internet giants mentioned above.\nWith regard to KlickZie\u2019s technology for marking, storing and tracking digital imagery, there are many firms who mark, store and track digital imagery. Among these have been Digimarc, BatchPhoto, and Thirdlight who have marketed such processes for purposes of protecting intellectual property. To our knowledge none of these has turned the smartphone into a generally trustable imager or an advanced image-based communicator as envisioned here. This requires substantially more talent and development activity than required for marking, storing and tracking digital imagery. However, there is nothing stopping any firm, particularly the internet giants, from entering into similar activity. Moreover Truepic, which entered the arena of smartphone trusted imagery, also has patents related to trusted imagery. We have reviewed Truepic\u2019s patent claims and believe that our planned applications do not infringe their claims.\nIntangible Properties: issued and pending patents\nThe proprietary nature of, and protection for, our technologies, processes, and know-how are important to our business. Our success could substantially depend upon our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our technologies and know-how, to protect our technology from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.\nWe seek patent protection for our technologies. Our policy is to patent the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications will be granted, or that any patents or licenses which we own or obtain in the future will fully protect our position. Our patent rights and the patent rights of technology companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. We believe that our existing technology licensing, and the patents which we hold and for which we have applied, do not infringe anyone else's patent rights. We believe our technology and patent rights will provide meaningful protection against others duplicating our proprietary technologies. We cannot be sure of this, however, because of the complexity of the legal and scientific issues that could arise in litigation over these issues.\nDespite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages.\nAs of the date of this annual report, our patent portfolio includes the patents and applications issued by and filed with the USPTO and the purchase technology licensing as described in the following table:\nTitle\nStatus\nPatent or Application Number\nGrant or Application Date\nLicense to commercialize the patent: Exploitation Of Augmented Reality And Cryptotoken Economics In An Information-Centric Network Of Smartphone Users And Other Imaging Cyborgs\nPatent pending owned by Arknet Inc & licensed to Tautachrome\n62/755589\n11/05/18\nAuthentication And Validation Of Smartphone Imagery\nPatent granted to & owned by Tautachrome\n02/28/17\nAuthentication And Validation Of Smartphone Imagery\nPatent granted to & owned by Tautachrome\n07/10/18\nAuthentication And Validation Of Smartphone Imagery\nPatent granted to & owned by Tautachrome\n07/10/18\nSystem And Method For Creating, Processing, And Distributing Images That Serve As Portals Enabling Communication With Persons Who Have Interacted With The Images\nPatent granted to & owned by Tautachrome\n03/27/18\nSystem And Method For Creating, Processing, And Distributing Images That Serve As Portals Enabling Communication With Persons Who Have Interacted With The Images\nPatent granted to & owned by Tautachrome\n15/888381\n02/05/18\nWe rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our ownership of know-how and trade secrets through an active program of legal mechanism including assignments, confidentiality agreements, material transfer agreements, research collaborations, and licenses.\nEmployees\nTautachrome, Inc. has no employees. Services are currently provided through independent contractors.",
    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation\nThe following Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d) provides information for the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. This MD&A should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d elsewhere in this report.\nOverall Performance\nWe are an early stage internet applications company, engaged in advanced technology and business development in the internet applications space. We have incurred general and administrative costs, marketing expenses and research and development costs since we commenced our current operations in May 2015, against very little revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. We had negative cash flows from operations of $90,344 and $1,014,724 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with recurring losses and negative working capital of $3,867,587 and $4,329,297 as at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe continuing operations of the Company are dependent upon our ability to raise adequate financing and to commence profitable operations in the future. The Company may raise additional capital through the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or through loans from related parties. We believe that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding may provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. There is no guarantee, however, that the Company will be successful in achieving these objectives.\nResults of Operations for the Years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019\nNet Comprehensive Loss\nThe Company realized a net comprehensive loss of $2,874,525 for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a net comprehensive loss of $3,388,979 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nRevenue and Cost of Sales\nThe Company recognized $1,015 in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus $209 in 2019. The company has two sources of revenues: the online sales platform in which we take a 2% fee for all merchant sales made on the platform and promotional products such a t-shirts. Cost of sales were $371 for the year ended December 31, 2020 versus non in 2019.\nOperating Expenses\nThe Company\u2019s total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1,625,789 compared to $1,171,816 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $453,973, or 39%).\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $607,274 compared to $617,877 for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $10,603 (2%) primarily attributable to increased software development activity offset by decreases in consulting costs . The following table sets out the material components of the Company\u2019s general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nYear Ended December 31,\nCategory of General and Administrative Expense\nLegal and accounting fees\n$ 129,329\n$ 272,447\nConsulting\n85,860\n75,000\nOther professional services\n77,053\n166,842\nOffice and occupancy costs\n27,422\n19,603\nArknet license fees\n200,000\n-\nAdvertising and promotion\n64,764\n49,967\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,621\n-\nOther\n19,225\n34,018\n$ 607,274\n$ 617,877\nResearch and development\nResearch and development costs were $1,014,894 in 2020 versus $553,939 in 2019 owing to increased development activity.\nOther Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a gain of $105,000 on our settlement of the McRae affair (See Note 6 to the financial statements). We had no such gains in the previous year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we had losses on settlements of debt of $96,993. We had no such losses in the current year.\nThe Company recorded $1,021,100 of interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2020 versus $568,828 during the previous year. About $400,000 was due to an increase in discount amortization due to the introduction of derivative liabilities associated with the issuance of new convertible notes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we had $127,031 of losses on conversion of debt. During 2020, we had 37,267 of such losses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded loss on changes in the value of our derivative liabilities in the amount of $215,812 compared to a loss of $1,426,354 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther Comprehensive Loss\nAt each balance sheet date, transactions and balances that are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars are adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate which may give rise to a foreign currency translation adjustment accounted for as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity and included in other comprehensive income. The Company recorded a translation loss of $80,201 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a gain of $1,837 for the year ended December 31, 2019. These amounts are included in the Company\u2019s statement of operations as foreign currency gain (loss) for the respective years.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of the date of this report, the Company has generated only $1,221 in revenue and is not profitable. The Company\u2019s operations to date have been funded primarily by private placements of common stock and convertible notes, as well as by loans from its management and controlling stockholders.\nAs at December 31, 2020, the Company had $114,527 in cash and $3,982,114 in current liabilities resulting in a working capital deficit of $3,867,587. The Company is not currently able to maintain its operations through its existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows. Moreover, we have determined that the current capital structure of the Company is not adequate to fund its planned growth.\nWe intend to secure additional capital to fund the Company\u2019s operations through the issuance of common stock, convertible debt instruments and loans from our management. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the capital the Company requires to achieve its business objectives, or that such capital will be available on acceptable terms. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including technology development costs, technology product rollout and support expense and the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services.\nOperating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company used net cash of $910,344 in operating activities compared to $1,014,724 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased net losses.\nThe Company\u2019s average monthly cash burn rate was $75,862 during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $84,560 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Subject to the success of the Company\u2019s financing activities, we expect to increase operating activities in the coming year with a concomitant increase in the Company\u2019s monthly burn rate. We will not be able to predict the increase to our burn rate until we have determined the outcomes of our financing activities.\nInvesting Activities\nThe Company purchased on hend-held self-positioning white light scanner system during the year ended December 31, 2020. The original cost was $43,447.\nFinancing Activities\nThe Company received net cash of $1,125,215 from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, consisting primarily from the issuance of convertible notes. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received a net of $1,038,010 from financing activities which, again, we primarily from the issue of convertible notes. We expect to continue our financing activities to fund our operations until such time as the Company\u2019s technologies are commercialized and we generate revenue on a profitable basis.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u2019s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of the Company\u2019s financial statements is critical to an understanding of its financial statements.\nWe adopted ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Under this method, the Company follows the five-step model provided by ASC Topic 606 in order to recognize revenue in the following manner: 1) Identify the contract; 2) Identify the performance obligations of the contract; 3) Determine the transaction price of the contract; 4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) Recognize revenue. An entity recognizes revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company\u2019s revenue recognition policies remained substantially unchanged as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, and there were no significant changes in business processes or systems.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-02, \u201cLeases (Topic 842)\u201d and subsequent amendments, which replaced existing lease accounting guidance in GAAP and requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all in-scope leases with a term of greater than 12 months and requires disclosure of certain quantitative and qualitative information pertaining to an entity\u2019s leasing arrangements. The Company adopted the standard as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We regularly evaluate estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets, valuation of convertible debentures, assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation and derivative liabilities, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (FASB) Accounting Codification Standard No. 820 (\u201cASC 820), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. ASC 820 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2 - Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe Company\u2019s financial instruments consist principally of cash, amounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, due to related parties and convertible notes. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of the Company\u2019s cash is determined based on \u201cLevel 1\u201d inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. We believe that the recorded values of all of the Company\u2019s other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe have reviewed the FASB issue Accounting Standards Update, (\u201cASU\u201d) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness dates during the period reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material impact on the corporation\u2019s reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration.",

Our Bylaws generally provide for majority approval of directors in order to adopt resolutions, and provide that the Board of Directors may be expanded by Board action. All executive officer compensation, including payroll expenditures, salaries, stock options, stock incentives, and bonuses, must be approved by the unanimous consent of the Board of Directors. The entire Board of Directors acts as the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee.\nOn future compensation matters, the Board will consider and recommend payroll expenditures, salaries, stock options, stock incentive and bonus proposals for our employees (if any). Acting in its audit committee function, the Board reviews, with our independent accountants, our annual financial statements prior to publication, and reviews the work of, and approves non-audit services performed by, such independent accountants. The Board appoints the independent public accountants for the ensuing year. The Board also reviews the effectiveness of the financial and accounting functions and the organization, operation and management of our Company.\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nThe following table identifies each person who, at any time during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, was a director, executive officer, or beneficial owner of more than 10% of our common stock that failed to file on a timely basis reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal year:\nName\nNumber of Late Reports\nNumber of Transactions Not Reported on a Timely Basis\nReports Not Filed\nDr. Jon Leonard\nDavid LaMountain\nCode of Ethics\nWe do not currently have a Code of Ethics, because we have only limited business operations, have a limited number of officers and directors, and believe a Code of Ethics would, at the present time, have limited utility.

Instead, the board considers how a candidate could contribute to the Company's business and meet the needs of the Company and the board.\nIndemnification\nUnder our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the corporation, we may indemnify an officer or director who is made a party to any proceeding, including a law suit, because of his position, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in our best interest. We may advance expenses incurred in defending a proceeding. To the extent that the officer or director is successful on the merits in a proceeding as to which he is to be indemnified, we must indemnify him against all expenses incurred, including attorney's fees. With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware.\nRegarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Delaware law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable."

When we enter a new product market, we begin with a small number of early adopter customers. We focus on learning from these early adopters and ensuring that they are successful with our products. Once successful, our early adopters have developed into vocal advocates, enabling our reference selling model.\nFinally, our goal is to drive strong growth and profitability through highly efficient, targeted sales and marketing, disciplined product planning, and profitable professional services. Our strong growth and profitability have allowed us to make ongoing investments for continued product innovation in our existing markets and provides us with the resources to invest in new market opportunities.\nOur Industry Cloud Solutions for Life Sciences\nOur industry cloud solutions for the life sciences industry are grouped into two key product areas-Veeva Commercial Cloud and Veeva Vault-and are designed to address pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies\u2019 most pressing strategic needs in their commercial and R&D operations.\nVeeva Commercial Cloud\nVeeva Commercial Cloud is a suite of software, data and analytics solutions built specifically for life sciences companies to more efficiently and effectively commercialize their products.\nVeeva Commercial Cloud software applications include:\n\u2022Veeva CRM and Veeva Medical CRM enable customer-facing employees, such as life sciences sales representatives, key account managers, and scientific liaisons, to manage, track, and optimize interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations utilizing a single, integrated solution.

For an explanation of how we define current customers, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Results of Operations.\u201d We deliver solutions to companies throughout the life sciences industry, including pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device companies, contract sales organizations, and contract research organizations. Our life sciences customers range from the largest global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as Bayer AG, Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Eli Lilly and Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., and Novartis International AG, to emerging growth pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including Alkermes plc, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Idorsia Pharmaceuticals Ltd, and Moderna Inc. We also deliver solutions to companies in the following regulated industries outside of life sciences: consumer goods, chemicals, and cosmetics.\nOur Human Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had a world-wide employee population of 4,506 employees, up by 1,005 from the previous year. Our employees in the United States are not represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign locations, local workers\u2019 councils represent our employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good.\nOur workforce is diverse in many respects. As of January 31, 2021, 42% of our global employee population self-identified as female, and as of December 31, 2020, approximately 38% of our U.S. workforce self-identified as members of underrepresented racial or ethnic groups.\nWe use a combination of base salary and equity to compensate our employees. We also offer a range of benefits to our employees, including comprehensive healthcare and other wellness programs. We believe our compensation and benefits programs are competitive.\nWhile we experience intense competition for talent, we believe we have been effective in attracting and retaining talented employees. Our rate of voluntary attrition has been comparatively low historically.\nResearch and Development\nOur R&D organization is responsible for the design, development, and testing of our solutions and applications. Based on customer feedback and needs, we focus our efforts on developing new solutions functionality, applications, and core technologies and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance, and flexibility of existing solutions and applications.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell our solutions through our direct sales organization. In large life sciences companies, the R&D and commercial business functions commonly have separate technology and business decision makers. Accordingly, we market and sell our solutions to align with the distinct characteristics of those decision makers. We have distinct R&D and commercial sales teams, which we further segment to focus on selling to large global life sciences companies and smaller life sciences companies. We also have a distinct sales team for our sales efforts to companies in regulated industries outside of life sciences.\nTechnology Infrastructure and Operations\nOur solutions utilize a pod-based architecture that allows for scalability, operational simplicity, and security. Our products are hosted in data centers located in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, and South Korea. Our products used only in China are hosted in data centers located in China. We utilize third parties to provide our computing infrastructure and manage the infrastructure on which our solutions operate. For example, for Veeva CRM and certain of our multichannel CRM applications, we utilize the hosting infrastructure provided by salesforce.com. For our Veeva Vault applications, Veeva Network applications, and certain other Veeva Commercial Cloud applications, we utilize Amazon Web Services.\nOur infrastructure providers employ advanced measures to ensure physical integrity and security, including redundant power and cooling systems, fire and flood prevention mechanisms, continual security coverage, biometric readers at entry points and anonymous exteriors. We also implement various disaster recovery measures such that data loss would be minimized in the event of a single data center disaster. We architect our solutions using\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nredundant configurations to minimize service interruptions. We continually monitor our solutions for any sign of failure or pending failure, and we take preemptive action to attempt to minimize or prevent downtime.\nOur technology is based on multitenant architectures that apply common, consistent management practices for all customers using our solutions. We enable multiple customers to share the same version of our solutions while securely partitioning their respective data. Portions of our multichannel customer relationship management applications are built on the Salesforce Platform of salesforce.com inc. Our Veeva Vault applications, Veeva Network, and portions of our other Commercial Cloud applications are built upon our own proprietary platforms. Certain of our other applications rely on technology platforms provided by Amazon Web Services. For example, Veeva Nitro, our commercial data warehouse application, utilizes Amazon Redshift.\nQuality and Compliance Program\nVeeva maintains a quality management system certified to ISO9001 to ensure process controls conform to established industry standards across our regulated product offerings. To comply with IT healthcare regulations, certain capabilities such as robust audit trail tracking, compliant electronic signature capture, data encryption, and secure access controls must be designed for and embedded in our solutions. In addition to design requirements, our solutions must be thoroughly tested to comply with the regulations that apply to electronic record keeping systems for the life sciences industry, which include:\nRegulation Regulation Description\n21 CFR 820.75 U.S. FDA device regulation on system validation\n21 CFR 211.68 U.S. FDA pharma GMP regulation on system validation\n21 CFR 11 U.S. FDA requirement for maintenance of electronic records\nEU Annex 11 EU Good Manufacturing Processes (GMP) requirement for maintenance of electronic records\n21 CFR 203 Drug sample tracking as required by the Prescription Drug Marketing Act\nPFSB Notification, No. 0401022 (Japan) Use of Electromagnetic Records and Electronic Signatures for Approval of, or License for, Drugs\nOECD No. 17\nApplication of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Principles to Computerised Systems\nICH E6(R2) Section 5.5\nGood Clinical Practice (GCP) Validation Principles\nSecurity Program\nVeeva maintains an information security management system certified to ISO 27001 and managed by our Chief Information Security Officer to ensure security controls conform to established standards across both product and infrastructure components. Our solution undergoes internal vulnerability testing prior to release, and we employ third parties to perform penetration and vulnerability tests on our solutions on at least an annual basis. We also obtain independent third-party audit opinions related to security and availability annually, such as SOC 2 Type 2 reports and ISO 27001 attestation reports. We also require role-based security and security awareness training and have defined security incident response processes.\nPrivacy Program\nVeeva maintains a global privacy program aligned to applicable laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We have a Chief Privacy Officer, who collaborates with our Chief Information Security Officer and business and product leaders throughout our organization. Veeva maintains an active EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certification and a Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield certification; however, we currently rely on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses as our alternative legal data transfer mechanism. Veeva is also registered as a data broker as required by the California Attorney General. In addition, Veeva maintains privacy policies and procedures and role-based privacy awareness training. For more information about our privacy practices, please visit veeva.com/privacy.\nCompetition\nThe markets for our solutions are global, rapidly evolving, highly competitive, and subject to changing regulations, advancing technology, and shifting customer needs. In new sales cycles, we generally compete with other cloud-\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nbased solutions from providers that make applications geared toward the life sciences industry. The principal such competitor for our Veeva Commercial Cloud applications is IQVIA Inc., which offers a CRM application built on the Salesforce Platform and other applications. Our data and data analytics products, including Veeva OpenData, Veeva Link, Veeva Crossix, and Veeva Data Cloud, compete with IQVIA and smaller data and data analytics providers. No single vendor offers products that compete with all of our Veeva Vault applications, but IQVIA, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, OpenText Corporation, Oracle Corporation, and other smaller application providers offer applications that compete with certain of our Veeva Vault applications.\nOur Commercial Cloud and Veeva Vault application suites also compete to replace client server-based legacy solutions offered by companies such as Oracle, Microsoft Corporation, and other smaller application providers. Our customers may also choose to use cloud-based applications or platforms that are not life sciences specific-such as Box, Inc., Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft-for certain of the functions our applications provide.\nWe sell certain of our Veeva Vault applications to companies outside the life sciences industry. In this segment of our business, we compete with solutions such as those offered by OpenText, Microsoft, Sparta Systems Inc. (recently acquired by Honeywell International Inc.), EtQ Management Consultants, LLC, Oracle, and Box, and custom-built software developed by third-party vendors or in-house by our potential customers.\nOur business consulting and professional services offerings compete with a range of professional services firms.\nSome of our actual and potential competitors have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand and business recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios, and agreements with a broader set of system integrators and other partners. We expect competition to intensify in the future, and we may face competition from new market entrants as well.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:\n\u2022level of customer satisfaction;\n\u2022regulatory compliance verification and functionality;\n\u2022domain expertise with respect to life sciences;\n\u2022ease of deployment and use of solutions and applications;\n\u2022breadth and depth of solution and application functionality;\n\u2022brand awareness and reputation;\n\u2022modern and adaptive technology platform;\n\u2022capability for customization, configurability, integration, security, scalability and reliability of applications;\n\u2022total cost of ownership;\n\u2022ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;\n\u2022size of customer base and level of user adoption;\n\u2022ability to secure the rights to load and process third party proprietary data licensed by customers; and\n\u2022ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications.\nWe believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of these factors.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We have developed a process for seeking patent protection for\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nour technology innovations. The table below provides a summary of our issued patents and pending patent applications as of January 31, 2021:\nIssued U.S. patents (expiring between May 2027 and January 2039) 33\nIssued international patents (expiring between April 2025 and June 2037) 11\nU.S. and international pending patent applications 58\nOur patents and patent applications cover technology within the following of our product categories: Veeva Commercial Cloud, Veeva Vault Platform, Veeva Vault Clinical, Veeva Vault RIM, Veeva Vault CDMS, and Veeva Vault Safety. We plan to continue expanding our patent portfolio. We require our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements, and we control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Although we rely on our intellectual property rights, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our applications are essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position as a provider of technology solutions to the life sciences industry.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our application. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult, and protection of our rights through civil enforcement mechanisms may be expensive and time consuming.\nCompanies in our industry, as well as non-practicing entities, often own a number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. We are currently engaged in legal proceedings with competitors in which the competitors are asserting trade secret misappropriation and other claims, and we may face new allegations in the future that we have infringed the patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights of other competitors or non-practicing entities. We expect that we and others in our industry will continue to be subject to third-party infringement claims by competitors as the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps, and by non-practicing entities. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time. For example, see the description of our current litigations in note 15 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nCorporate Information\nOur website address is http://www.veeva.com.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. We discuss factors that we believe could cause or contribute to these differences below and elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nVeeva is the leading provider of industry cloud solutions for the global life sciences industry. We were founded in 2007 on the premise that industry-specific cloud solutions could best address the operating challenges and regulatory requirements of life sciences companies. Our solutions span cloud software, data, and business consulting and are designed to meet the unique needs of our customers and their most strategic business functions-from research and development (R&D) to commercialization. Our solutions help life sciences companies develop and bring products to market faster and more efficiently, market and sell more effectively, and maintain compliance with government regulations.\nIn our fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we derived approximately 51% and 49% of our subscription services revenues and 49% and 51% of our total revenues from our Veeva Commercial Cloud solutions and Veeva Vault solutions, respectively. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020, we derived approximately 52% and 48% of our subscription services revenues and 49% and 51% of our total revenues from our Veeva Commercial Cloud solutions and Veeva Vault solutions, respectively. The contribution of subscription services revenues and total revenues associated with our Veeva Vault solutions are expected to continue to increase as a percentage of subscription services revenues and total revenues in the future. Please note that revenues attributable to our Crossix and Physicians World businesses, which we acquired in November 2019, are classified under Veeva Commercial Cloud and impacted the mix of revenues between Veeva Commercial Cloud and Veeva Vault. We also offer certain of our Veeva Vault solutions to three industries outside the life sciences industry primarily in North America and Europe.\nFor our fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our total revenues were $1,465 million, $1,104 million, and $862 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth in total revenues of 33% in our fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, and 28% in our fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. For our fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our subscription services revenues were $1,179 million, $896 million, and $694 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth in subscription services revenues of 32% in our fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, and 29% in our fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. Please note that our total revenues and subscription services revenues for our fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 only included revenue contribution from the acquired Crossix and Physicians World businesses in the fourth quarter of that fiscal year. We expect the growth rate of our total revenues and subscription services revenues to decline in the future. We generated net income of $380 million, $301 million, and $230 million for our fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nAs of January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we served 993, 861, and 719, customers, respectively. As of January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we had 432, 390 and 335 Veeva Commercial Cloud customers, respectively, and 852, 715, and 574 Veeva Vault customers, respectively. The combined customer counts for Veeva Commercial Cloud and Veeva Vault exceed the total customer count in each year because some customers subscribe to products in both areas. Veeva Commercial Cloud customers are those customers that have at least one of the following products: Veeva CRM, Veeva CLM, Veeva CRM Approved Email, Veeva CRM Engage, Veeva Align, Veeva CRM Events Management (including services delivered via Veeva Digital Events), Veeva Nitro, Veeva Andi, Veeva OpenData, Veeva Link, Veeva Network Customer Master, Veeva Crossix, or Veeva Data Cloud. Veeva Vault customers are those customers that have at least one Vault product. Many of our Veeva Vault applications are used by smaller, earlier stage pre-commercial companies, some of which may not reach the commercialization stage. Thus, the potential number of Veeva Vault customers is significantly higher than the potential number of Veeva Commercial Cloud customers.\nOn November 1, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Crossix, a provider of privacy-safe patient data and data analytics. Crossix brings Veeva additional depth in patient data and data analytics. Crossix's existing data analytics offerings are complementary to our existing Commercial Cloud offerings, and we are utilizing the Crossix Data Platform to build Veeva Data Cloud, our longitudinal patient and prescriber data offering. Further, on November 7, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Physicians World, a provider of speakers bureau services for healthcare professionals. Acquiring Physicians World makes it easier for our customers to get industry leading cloud software and services from a single vendor. We consider these businesses fully integrated into Veeva as of January 31, 2021.\nRecent Development\nOn February 1, 2021, we became a Delaware public benefit corporation (PBC), and we amended our certificate of incorporation to include the following public benefit purpose: \u201cto provide products and services that are intended to help make the industries we serve more productive, and to create high-quality employment opportunities in the communities in which we operate.\u201d When making decisions, our directors have a fiduciary duty to balance the financial interests of stockholders, the best interests of other stakeholders materially affected by our conduct (including customers, employees, partners, and the communities in which we operate), and the pursuit of our public benefit purpose. For more information on our conversion to a PBC and associated risks, see \u201cBusiness\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 has had and continues to have a widespread and unpredictable worldwide impact on our business operations, the life sciences industry, healthcare systems, financial markets, and the global economy. While the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance has not been materially negative to date, the future impact is uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, government responses to the pandemic, the impact on our customers, the impact on our employees, the extent of further adverse impacts to the economy, and the scale and pace of economic recovery and resumption of normal business activities, all of which cannot be predicted with certainty.\nIn response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we shifted most of our customer, employee, and industry events to virtual-only experiences for our fiscal year ending January 31, 2021. We will continue to monitor events related to the pandemic and plan to continue the same approach for our fiscal year ending January 31, 2022. We have also implemented employee travel restrictions and, as of the time of this filing, for many of our U.S. offices, including our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton, California, we have recommended that most employees work from home and the substantial majority of employees continue to do so. Many of our customers have implemented similar measures, which may limit our ability to sell or provide professional services to them over time. Customers may delay or cancel purchasing decisions or professional services projects in light of uncertainties to their businesses arising from COVID-19 or may renew their subscriptions at lower levels. In our fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, our recently acquired Crossix and Physicians World businesses were negatively impacted by COVID-19, and sales to certain other customer segments were and may continue to be negatively impacted as well, including sales to cosmetics companies. We may also experience requests from customers for lengthened payment terms or less favorable billing terms that could adversely impact our financial performance. Such requests to date have not been significant but may increase in the future. Due to our subscription-based business model, the effect of COVID-19, and any impact to our sales efforts, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nAt the same time, COVID-19 has necessitated the adoption of digital communication channels and remote working technology within the life sciences industry at a rapid pace. This transition has accelerated the use and adoption of certain of our applications, including Veeva CRM Engage Meeting and Veeva CRM Approved Email, and that may continue in the future with respect to these and other of our Veeva Commercial Cloud and Veeva Vault solutions that enable remote interactions. For instance, from March 2020 until December 31, 2020, we allowed customers to use Veeva CRM Engage Meeting free of charge to facilitate the ability for life sciences personnel to meet remotely with healthcare professionals. A significant number of customers adopted and began use of Veeva CRM Engage Meeting for the first time during this period, and we observed a dramatic increase in the volume of virtual meetings with healthcare professionals via Veeva CRM Engage Meeting over the same time period. At the end of the free use period, we saw very high conversion rates to paid subscriptions by the customers who were using Veeva Engage Meeting without charge during the free use period.\nCertain impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting changes in business practice may be enduring over the long term and may result in significant changes in business practice within the technology industry, the life sciences industry, and the world economy generally. For example, the extent to which remote work will remain common practice or become increasingly prevalent after the COVID-19 pandemic ends is not certain and may have significant impacts on hiring practices, management practices, expense structures and investments, and other aspects of our business and the businesses of our customers. Similarly, the extent to which virtual meetings and interactions continue to be used or preferred in lieu of in-person interactions may significantly change business practices for us and our customers, and, in turn, may impact demand for our products and services. For example, if our customers reduce sales representatives in response to an increasing preference for virtual meetings with doctors, demand for our core CRM application may decline. We expect life sciences companies to reduce the number of sales representatives that they employ by roughly 10% over the next one to two years, which could negatively impact sales of our solutions, including Veeva CRM and other Commercial Cloud applications in particular, but we cannot be certain such reductions will happen or of the timing or magnitude of such reductions. At the same time, demand for our products that enable virtual interactions with doctors and clinical trial participants may increase. We cannot accurately predict how such changes may impact Veeva's results over the long term.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nInvestment in Growth\nWe have invested and intend to continue to invest aggressively in expanding the breadth and depth of our product portfolio, including through acquisitions. We expect to continue to invest in research and development to expand existing solutions and build new solutions; in sales and marketing to promote our solutions to new and existing customers and in existing and expanded geographies and industries; in professional services and business consulting to help ensure customer success; and in other operational and administrative functions to support our expected growth. We expect that our headcount will increase as a result of these investments. We also expect our total operating expenses will continue to increase over time, which could have a negative impact on our operating margin.\nAdoption of Our Solutions by Existing and New Customers\nMost of our customers initially deploy our solutions to a limited number of end users within a division or geography and may only initially deploy a limited set of our available solutions. Our future growth is dependent upon our existing customers\u2019 continued success and their renewals of subscriptions to our solutions, expanded deployment of our solutions within their organizations, and their purchase of subscriptions to additional solutions. Our growth is also dependent on the adoption of our solutions by new customers.\nSubscription Services Revenue Retention Rate\nA key factor to our success is the renewal and expansion of our existing subscription agreements with our customers. We calculate our annual subscription services revenue retention rate for a particular fiscal year by dividing (i) annualized subscription revenue as of the last day of that fiscal year from those customers that were also customers as of the last day of the prior fiscal year by (ii) the annualized subscription revenue from all customers as of the last day of the prior fiscal year. Annualized subscription revenue is calculated by multiplying the daily subscription revenue recognized on the last day of the fiscal year by 365. This calculation includes the impact on our revenues from customer non-renewals, deployments of additional users or decreases in users, deployments of additional solutions or discontinued use of solutions by our customers, and price changes for our solutions.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nHistorically, the impact of price changes on our subscription services revenue retention rate has been minimal. For our fiscal years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our subscription services revenue retention rate was 124%, 121%, and 122%, respectively.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription services fees and professional services fees. Subscription services revenues consist of fees from customers accessing our cloud-based software solutions and fees for our data solutions. Professional services and other revenues consist primarily of fees from implementation services, configuration, data services, training, and managed services related to our solutions and services related to our Veeva Business Consulting offerings. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, subscription services revenues constituted 81% of total revenues and professional services and other revenues constituted 19% of total revenues.\nWe generally enter into master subscription agreements with our customers and count each distinct master subscription agreement that has not been terminated or expired and that has orders for which we have recognized revenue in the quarter as a distinct customer for purposes of determining our total number of current customers as of the end of that quarter. We generally enter into a single master subscription agreement with each customer, although in some instances, affiliated legal entities within the same corporate family may enter into separate master subscription agreements. Conversely, affiliated legal entities that maintain distinct master service agreements may choose to consolidate their orders under a single master service agreement, and, in that circumstance, our customer count would decrease. Divisions, subsidiaries, and operating units of our customers often place distinct orders for our subscription services under the same master subscription agreement, and we do not count such distinct orders as new customers for purposes of determining our total customer count. For purposes of determining customers of Veeva Crossix that do not contract under a master subscription agreement, we count each entity that has a statement of work or services agreement and a recurring known payment obligation as a distinct customer if such entity is not otherwise a customer of ours.\nNew subscription orders for our core Veeva CRM application generally have a one-year term. If a customer adds end users or additional Veeva Commercial Cloud applications to an existing order for our core Veeva CRM application, such additional orders will generally be coterminous with the anniversary date of the core Veeva CRM order, and as a result, orders for additional end users or additional Veeva Commercial Cloud applications will commonly have an initial term of less than one year.\nWith respect to applications other than our core Veeva CRM application and particularly with respect to our Veeva Vault applications, we have entered into a number of orders with multi-year terms. The fees associated with such orders are typically not based on the number of end-users and typically escalate over the term of such orders at a pre-agreed rate to account for, among other factors, implementation and adoption timing and planned increased usage by the customer. There are timing differences between billings and revenue recognition with respect to certain of our multi-year orders with escalating fees which will result in fluctuations in deferred revenue and unbilled accounts receivable balances. For instance, when the amounts we are entitled to invoice in any period pursuant to multi-year orders with escalating fees are less than the revenue recognized in accordance with relevant accounting standards, we will accrue an unbilled accounts receivable balance (a contract asset) related to such orders. In the same scenario, the net deferred revenue we would record in connection with such orders will be less because we will be recognizing more revenue earlier in the term of such multi-year orders.\nOur subscription orders are generally billed at the beginning of the subscription period in annual or quarterly increments, which means the annualized value of such orders may not be completely reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Also, particularly with respect to our Veeva Commercial Cloud orders, because the term of orders for additional end users or applications is commonly less than one year, the annualized value of such orders may not be completely reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. We have also agreed from time to time, and may agree in the future, to allow customers to change the renewal dates of their orders to, for example, align more closely with a customer\u2019s annual budget process or to align with the renewal dates of other orders placed by other entities within the same corporate control group, or to change payment terms from annual to quarterly, or vice versa. Such changes typically result in an order of less than one year as necessary to align all orders to the desired renewal date and, thus, may result in a lesser increase to deferred revenue than if the adjustment had not occurred. Additionally, changes in renewal dates may change the fiscal quarter in which deferred revenue associated with a particular order is booked. Accordingly, we do not believe that changes on a\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nquarterly basis in deferred revenue, unbilled accounts receivable, or calculated billings, a metric commonly cited by financial analysts, are accurate indicators of future revenues for any given period of time. We define the term calculated billings for any period to mean revenue for the period plus the change in deferred revenue from the immediately preceding period minus the change in unbilled accounts receivable (contract asset) from the immediately preceding period.\nSubscription services revenues are recognized ratably over the respective non-cancelable subscription term because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. Our subscription services agreements are generally non-cancelable during the term, although customers typically have the right to terminate their agreements for cause in the event of material breach. Our agreements typically provide that orders will automatically renew unless notice of non-renewal is provided in advance. Subscription services revenues are affected primarily by the number of customers, the scope of the subscription purchased by each customer (for example, the number of end users or other subscription usage metric), and the number of solutions subscribed to by each customer.\nWe utilize our own personnel to perform our professional services and business consulting engagements with customers. In certain cases, we may utilize third-party subcontractors to perform professional services engagements. The majority of our professional services arrangements are billed on a time and materials basis and revenues are recognized over time based on time incurred and contractually agreed upon rates. Certain professional services and business consulting arrangements are billed on a fixed fee basis and revenues are typically recognized over time as the services are delivered based on time incurred. Data services and training revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed. Professional services revenues are affected primarily by our customers\u2019 demands for implementation services, configuration, data services, training, speakers bureau logistics, and managed services in connection with our solutions. Our business consulting revenues are affected primarily by our customers\u2019 demands for services related to a particular customer success initiative, strategic analysis, or business process change, and not a cloud software implementation.\nAllocated Overhead\nWe accumulate certain costs such as building depreciation, office rent, utilities, and other facilities costs and allocate them across the various departments based on headcount. We refer to these costs as \u201callocated overhead.\u201d\nCost of Revenues\nCost of subscription services revenues for all of our solutions consists of expenses related to our computing infrastructure provided by third parties, including salesforce.com and Amazon Web Services, personnel related costs associated with hosting our subscription services and providing support, including our data stewards, data acquisition costs, expenses associated with computer equipment and software, allocated overhead, and amortization expense associated with certain purchased intangibles related to our subscription services. We intend to continue to invest additional resources in our subscription services to enhance our product offerings and increase our delivery capacity. We may add or expand computing infrastructure capacity in the future, migrate to new computing infrastructure service providers, make additional investments in the availability and security of our solutions, and make continued investments in data sources.\nCost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related expenses associated with providing these services. The cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of the related revenues than for our subscription services due to the direct labor costs and costs of third-party subcontractors.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, third-party consulting fees, and hosted infrastructure costs. We continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and applications and increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud-based applications.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, sales commissions, marketing program costs, amortization expense associated with purchased intangibles related to our customer contracts, customer relationships and brand development, travel-related expenses, and allocated\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\noverhead. Marketing program costs include advertising, customer events, corporate communications, brand awareness, and product marketing activities. Sales commissions are costs of obtaining new customer contracts and are capitalized and then amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be three years.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of employee-related expenses for our executive, finance and accounting, legal, employee success, management information systems personnel, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include fees related to third-party legal counsel, fees related to third-party accounting, tax and audit services, other corporate expenses, and allocated overhead.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net, consists primarily of transaction gains or losses on foreign currency, net of hedging costs, interest income, and amortization of premiums paid on investments.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions. See note 9 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2021\nRefer to note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of the recent accounting pronouncements adopted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods indicated:\nFiscal year ended January 31,\n2021 2020\n(in thousands)\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income Data:\nRevenues:\nSubscription services $ 1,179,486 $ 896,294\nProfessional services and other 285,583 207,787\nTotal revenues 1,465,069 1,104,081\nCost of revenues(1):\nCost of subscription services 184,589 136,328\nCost of professional services and other 224,339 167,041\nTotal cost of revenues 408,928 303,369\nGross profit 1,056,141 800,712\nOperating expenses(1):\nResearch and development 294,220 209,895\nSales and marketing 235,014 190,331\nGeneral and administrative 149,113 114,267\nTotal operating expenses 678,347 514,493\nOperating income 377,794 286,219\nOther income, net 16,199 27,478\nIncome before income taxes 393,993 313,697\nProvision for income taxes 13,995 12,579\nNet income $ 379,998 $ 301,118\n(1) Includes stock-based compensation as follows:\nCost of revenues:\nCost of subscription services $ 4,840 $ 2,638\nCost of professional services and other 27,698 17,518\nResearch and development 63,541 37,001\nSales and marketing 40,574 27,537\nGeneral and administrative 48,348 31,212\nTotal stock-based compensation $ 185,001 $ 115,906\nFiscal Year Ended January 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following is a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. For a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019, please refer to Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2020, which is hereby incorporated by reference.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nRevenues\nFiscal year ended January 31,\n2021 2020 % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenues:\nSubscription services $ 1,179,486 $ 896,294 32%\nProfessional services and other 285,583 207,787 37%\nTotal revenues $ 1,465,069 $ 1,104,081 33%\nPercentage of revenues:\nSubscription services 81 % 81 %\nProfessional services and other 19 19\nTotal revenues 100 % 100 %\nTotal revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 increased $361 million, of which $283 million was from growth in subscription services revenues. The increase in subscription services revenues consisted of $152 million of subscription services revenue attributable to Veeva Vault solutions and $131 million of subscription services revenue attributable to Veeva Commercial Cloud solutions, which includes the full year contribution from Veeva Crossix. The geographic mix of subscription services revenues was 56% from North America and 27% from Europe for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 as compared to subscription services revenues of 54% from North America and 27% from Europe for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.\nProfessional services and other revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 increased $78 million. The increase was primarily due to new customers requesting implementation and deployment related professional services and existing customers requesting professional services related to expanding deployments or the deployment of newly purchased solutions, and, to a lesser extent, professional services revenues associated with our acquired Veeva Crossix and Physicians World businesses, which only contributed to revenue in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The increased demand for professional services and the resulting increase in professional services revenues was weighted heavily towards implementation and deployments of our Veeva Vault solutions. The geographic mix of professional services and other revenues was 62% from North America and 30% from Europe for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 as compared to 60% from North America and 32% from Europe for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020.\nOver time, we expect the proportion of our total revenues from professional services to decrease.\nCosts and Expenses\nFiscal year ended January 31,\n2021 2020 % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nCost of revenues:\nCost of subscription services $ 184,589 $ 136,328 35%\nCost of professional services and other 224,339 167,041 34%\nTotal cost of revenues $ 408,928 $ 303,369 35%\nGross margin percentage:\nSubscription services 84 % 85 %\nProfessional services and other 21 % 20 %\nTotal gross margin percentage 72 % 73 %\nGross profit $ 1,056,141 $ 800,712 32%\nCost of revenues for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 increased $106 million, of which $48 million was related to cost of subscription services. The increase in cost of subscription services included an increase of $14 million in data acquisition costs related to the Veeva Data Cloud product offering. There was also an increase of $9 million in employee compensation-related costs (which includes an increase of $2 million in stock-based compensation) and was primarily driven by the increase in headcount during the period and the full year impact of the headcount from the acquired Crossix business. Finally, there was an increase of $7 million in fees paid to salesforce.com, driven by an increase in the number of end users of our subscription services, and an increase of\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\n$9 million in other computing infrastructure costs, the vast majority of which was for computing infrastructure provided by Amazon Web Services. We expect cost of subscription services to increase in absolute dollars in the near term due to increased usage of our subscription services and increased data costs related to our Veeva Data Cloud offering.\nCost of professional services and other for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 increased $57 million, primarily due to a $55 million increase in employee compensation-related costs (which includes an increase of $10 million in stock-based compensation). The increase in employee compensation-related costs is primarily driven by the increase in headcount during the period and the full year impact of the headcount from the acquired Physicians World business. We expect cost of professional services and other to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we add personnel to our global professional services organization.\nGross margin for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020 was 72% and 73%, respectively. The decrease compared to the prior period is largely due to the products and services of our acquired Crossix and Physicians World businesses, which have lower gross margins than many of our other products and services.\nOperating Expenses and Operating Margin\nOperating expenses include research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. As we continue to invest in our growth through hiring, we expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenue in the future.\nResearch and Development\nFiscal year ended January 31,\n2021 2020 % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nResearch and development $ 294,220 $ 209,895 40%\nPercentage of total revenues 20 % 19 %\nResearch and development expenses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 increased $84 million, primarily due to an increase of $71 million in employee compensation-related costs (which includes an increase of $27 million in stock-based compensation). The increase in employee compensation-related costs is primarily driven by the increase in headcount during the period. The expansion of our headcount in research and development is to support development work for the increased number of products that we offer or may offer in the future.\nWe expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenue in the future, primarily due to higher headcount as we continue to invest in our product offerings.\nSales and Marketing\nFiscal year ended January 31,\n2021 2020 % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nSales and marketing $ 235,014 $ 190,331 23%\nPercentage of total revenues 16 % 17 %\nSales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 increased $45 million, primarily due to an increase of $44 million in employee compensation-related costs (which includes an increase of $13 million in stock-based compensation). The increase in employee compensation-related costs is primarily driven by the increase in headcount during the period. There was an additional increase of $7 million in amortization of purchased intangibles related to our acquired Crossix and Physicians World businesses. These increases were partially offset by a $10 million decrease in travel and entertainment costs primarily related to travel and meeting restrictions associated with COVID-19.\nWe expect sales and marketing expenses to grow in absolute dollars in the future, primarily due to employee-related expenses as we increase our headcount to support our sales and marketing efforts associated with our\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nproduct offerings, the impact of changes to our sales compensation plans, and our continued expansion of our sales capacity across all our solutions. Additionally, we expect travel and entertainment costs to start to increase in the second half of the fiscal year ending January 31, 2022.\nGeneral and Administrative\nFiscal year ended January 31,\n2021 2020 % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nGeneral and administrative $ 149,113 $ 114,267 30%\nPercentage of total revenues 10 % 10 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 increased $35 million, primarily due to an increase of $31 million in employee compensation-related costs (which includes an increase of $17 million in stock-based compensation). The increase in employee compensation-related costs is primarily driven by the increase in headcount during the period.\nWe expect general and administrative expenses to continue to grow in absolute dollars in the future as a result of employee-related expenses as we increase our headcount, investments in information technology infrastructure, and third-party fees, including fees associated with on-going litigation.\nOther Income, Net\nFiscal year ended January 31,\n2021 2020 % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nOther income, net $ 16,199 $ 27,478 (41)%\nOther income, net, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 decreased $11 million, primarily due to a $9 million reduction in interest income, net, reflecting the lower interest rates on short-term investments.\nWe continue to experience foreign currency fluctuations primarily due to the impact resulting from the periodic re-measurement of our foreign currency balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Our results of operations are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen and Chinese Yuan. We may continue to experience favorable or adverse foreign currency impacts due to volatility in these currencies.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFiscal year ended January 31,\n2021 2020 % Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nIncome before income taxes $ 393,993 $ 313,697 26%\nProvision for income taxes $ 13,995 $ 12,579 11%\nEffective tax rate 3.6 % 4.0 %\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state taxes, tax credits, equity compensation, and the deduction for foreign derived intangible income. Future tax rates could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or by rulings in tax related litigation, as may be applicable. We will continue to identify and analyze other applicable changes in tax laws in the United States and abroad.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nFor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, our effective tax rates were 3.6% and 4.0%, respectively. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 as compared to the prior year period, our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to the increase in excess tax benefits related to equity compensation. We recognized such tax benefits in our provision for income taxes of $81 million and $50 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn our public disclosures, we have provided non-GAAP measures, which we define as financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. In addition to our GAAP measures, we use these non-GAAP financial measures internally for budgeting and resource allocation purposes and in analyzing our financial results.\nFor the reasons set forth below, we believe that excluding the following items provides information that is helpful in understanding our operating results, evaluating our future prospects, comparing our financial results across accounting periods, and comparing our financial results to our peers, many of which provide similar non-GAAP financial measures:\n\u2022Stock-based compensation expenses. We exclude stock-based compensation expenses primarily because they are non-cash expenses that we exclude from our internal management reporting processes. We also find it useful to exclude these expenses when we assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. Moreover, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, we believe excluding stock-based compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies.\n\u2022Amortization of purchased intangibles. We incur amortization expense for purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies. Amortization of intangible assets is a non-cash expense and is inconsistent in amount and frequency because it is significantly affected by the timing, size of acquisitions, and the inherent subjective nature of purchase price allocations. Because these costs have already been incurred and cannot be recovered, and are non-cash expenses, we exclude these expenses for internal management reporting processes. We also find it useful to exclude these charges when assessing the appropriate level of various operating expenses and resource allocations when budgeting, planning, and forecasting future periods. Investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well.\n\u2022Income tax effects on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP costs and expenses. The income tax effects that are excluded relate to the imputed tax impact on the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP costs and expenses due to stock-based compensation and purchased intangibles for GAAP and non-GAAP measures.\nLimitations on the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThere are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures because non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures provided by other companies.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which items are adjusted to calculate our non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in our public disclosures.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business, and to view our non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nThe following table reconciles the specific items excluded from GAAP metrics in the calculation of non-GAAP metrics for the periods shown below:\nFiscal year ended January 31,\n2021 2020\n(in thousands)\nOperating income on a GAAP basis $ 377,794 $ 286,219\nStock-based compensation expense 185,001 115,906\nAmortization of purchased intangibles 20,007 10,120\nOperating income on a non-GAAP basis $ 582,802 $ 412,245\nNet income on a GAAP basis $ 379,998 $ 301,118\nStock-based compensation expense 185,001 115,906\nAmortization of purchased intangibles 20,007 10,120\nIncome tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments(1)\n(111,795) (79,763)\nNet income on a non-GAAP basis $ 473,211 $ 347,381\nDiluted net income per share on a GAAP basis $ 2.36 $ 1.90\nStock-based compensation expense 1.15 0.73\nAmortization of purchased intangibles 0.12 0.06\nIncome tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments(1)\n(0.69) (0.50)\nDiluted net income per share on a non-GAAP basis $ 2.94 $ 2.19\n(1) For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020, we used an estimated annual effective non-GAAP tax rate of 21%\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal year ended January 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 551,246 $ 437,375 $ 310,827\nNet cash used in investing activities (333,634) (516,910) (103,869)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 33,818 10,010 25,910\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 484 (2,856) (2,077)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents $ 251,914 $ (72,381) $ 230,791\nOur principal sources of liquidity continue to be comprised of our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, as well as cash flows generated from our operations. As of January 31, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $1,664 million, of which $59 million represented cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States.\nOur remaining non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents have been earmarked for indefinite reinvestment in our operations outside the United States, except in certain designated jurisdictions that have an immaterial impact to our financial statements. As of January 31, 2021, we have not recorded any taxes, such as withholding taxes, associated with the foreign earnings that are indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. We believe our U.S. sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the United States and do not expect that we will need to repatriate additional funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Under currently enacted tax laws, should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, such amounts may be subject to certain jurisdictional taxes.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the ongoing investments in technology infrastructure, the introduction of new and enhanced solutions, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, and intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing for those arrangements or for other reasons. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nmay not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nThe following is a discussion of our cash flows for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. For a discussion of our cash flows for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019, please refer to Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2020, which is hereby incorporated by reference.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash inflows is cash collections from our customers for subscription services. We also generate significant cash flows from our professional services arrangements. The first quarter of our fiscal year is seasonally the strongest quarter for cash inflows due to the timing of our annual subscription billings and related collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, expenses related to our computing infrastructure (including salesforce.com and Amazon Web Services), building infrastructure costs (including leases for office space), fees for third-party legal counsel and accounting services, data acquisition costs, and marketing program costs. Note that our net income reflects the impact of excess tax benefits related to equity compensation.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $551 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $437 million provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The $114 million increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to net income for the period of $380 million driven by increased sales and the related impact to deferred revenue, partially offset by cash collections and the related impact to accounts receivable. Additionally, operating cash flow benefited from a non-cash adjustment for stock-based compensation.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to cash used for the purchase of marketable securities, net of maturities. We also use cash to invest in capital assets to support our growth.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $334 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $517 million used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The $183 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was mainly due to our prior year investments in Crossix and Physicians World acquisitions, partially offset by the nature and timing of purchases of short-term investments in excess of maturities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe cash flows from financing activities relate primarily to stock option exercises.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $34 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to $10 million provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020. The $24 million increase in cash provided by financing activities is primarily related to an increase in proceeds from employee stock option exercises resulting from both an increase in stock option exercise volume and a higher aggregate average exercise price during the period.\nCommitments\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations for minimum payment commitments to salesforce.com, and leases for office space and data centers. On March 3, 2014, we amended our agreement with salesforce.com. The agreement, as amended, requires that we meet minimum order commitments of $500 million over the term of the agreement, which ends on September 1, 2025, including \u201ctrue-up\u201d payments if the orders we place with salesforce.com have not equaled or exceeded the following aggregate amounts within the timeframes indicated: (i) $250 million for the period from March 1, 2014 to September 1, 2020 and (ii) the full amount of $500 million by September 1, 2025. We met our first minimum order commitment of $250 million and have a remaining purchase commitment of $57 million, as of January 31, 2021, that must be made by September 1, 2025.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K\nAs of January 31, 2021, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows:\nPayments due by period\nTotal Less than 1 year 1-3\nYears 3-5\nYears More than\n5 years\n(in thousands)\nSalesforce.com commitments $ 57,119 $ - $ - $ 57,119 $ -\nOperating lease obligations 71,504 12,887 22,365 14,676 21,576\nFinance lease obligations 380 380 - - -\nTotal $ 129,003 $ 13,267 $ 22,365 $ 71,795 $ 21,576\nThe amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding, which specify significant terms including payment terms, related services, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under agreements that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). In the preparation of these consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenues primarily from subscription services and professional services. Some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to the distinct performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Significant judgment is sometimes required in developing an estimate of the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation based on our overall pricing objectives, market conditions, and other factors, including other groupings such as customer type and geography.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows, future revenue growth, margins, customer retention rates, technology life, royalty rates, expected use of acquired assets, and discount rates. These factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets. These estimates are based in part on historical experience, market conditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recorded.\nVeeva Systems Inc. | Form 10-K",

As discussed in the section titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d included under Part I, Item 1A within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCompany Overview\nWe provide a cloud-based customer relationship management (\u201cCRM\u201d) Platform. Our CRM Platform is comprised of Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub and content management system (\u201cCMS\u201d) Hub as well as other tools and integrations that enable companies to attract, engage, and delight customers throughout the customer experience.\nAt the core of our CRM Platform is our CRM that our customers use which creates a single view of all interactions a prospective or existing customer has with their marketing, sales and customer service teams. The CRM shares data across every application in the CRM Platform, automatically informing more personalized emails, website content, ads, and conversations, and enables more accurate timing cues for our customer\u2019s internal teams. In addition, the CRM Platform was built to easily and seamlessly integrate third party applications to further customize to an individual company\u2019s industry or needs. We designed and built our CRM Platform to serve a broad range of customers globally. Our CRM Platform starts completely free and grows with our customers to meet their needs at different stages in their life-cycles. It supports multiple languages and currencies and offers an array of sophisticated features, including content partitioning at the enterprise level for companies operating in or serving multiple countries.\nWe focus on selling to mid-market business-to-business, or B2B, companies, which we define as companies that have between two and 2,000 employees. While our CRM Platform was built to grow with any company, we focus on selling to mid-market businesses because we believe we have significant competitive advantages attracting and serving this market segment. These mid-market businesses seek an integrated, easy-to-implement and easy-to-use solution to reach customers and compete with organizations that have larger marketing, sales, and customer service budgets. We efficiently reach these businesses at scale through our proven inbound methodology, our Solutions Partners, and our \u201cfreemium\u201d model. A Solutions Partner is a service provider that helps businesses with strategy, execution, and implementation of go-to-market activities and technology solutions. Our freemium model attracts customers who begin using our CRM Platform through our free products and then upgrade to our paid products. As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,225 full-time employees and 103,994 Total Customers of varying sizes in more than 120 countries, representing almost every industry.\nOur CRM Platform is a multi-tenant, single code-based and globally available software-as-a-service product delivered through web browsers or mobile applications. We sell our CRM Platform on a subscription basis. Our total revenue increased to $883.0 million in 2020, from $674.9 million in 2019, and from $513.0 million in 2018, representing year-over-year increases of 31% in 2020 and 32% in 2019. We had net losses of $85.0 million in 2020, $53.7 million in 2019, and $63.8 million in 2018, primarily due to investments in our growth.\nWe derive most of our revenue from subscriptions to our cloud-based CRM Platform and related professional services, which consist of customer on-boarding and training services. Subscription revenue accounted for 97% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 96% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 95% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. We sell multiple product plans at different base prices on a subscription basis, each of which includes our CRM and integrated applications to meet the needs of the various customers we serve. Customers pay additional fees if the number of contacts stored and tracked in the customer\u2019s database exceeds specified thresholds. We also generate additional revenue based on the purchase of additional subscriptions and products, and the number of account users and subdomains. Most of our customers\u2019 subscriptions are one year or less in duration.\nSubscriptions are billed in advance on various schedules. Because the mix of billing terms for orders can vary from period to period, the annualized value of the orders we enter into with our customers will not be completely reflected in deferred revenue at any single point in time. Accordingly, we do not believe that change in deferred revenue is an accurate indicator of future revenue.\nMany of our customers purchase on-boarding and training services which are designed to help customers enhance their ability to attract, engage and delight their customers using our CRM Platform. Professional services and other revenue accounted for 3% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, 4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 5% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect professional services and other margins to range from a moderate loss to breakeven for the foreseeable future.\nCOVID-19 Update\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization, or WHO, declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) to be a pandemic (the \u201cpandemic\u201d). This pandemic is having widespread, rapidly-evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets, and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including physical distancing, travel bans and restrictions, closure of non-essential businesses, quarantines, work-from-home directives, shelter-in-place orders, and limitations on public gatherings. These measurements have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide.\nOur focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers, and ensuring business continuity. In March 2020, we temporarily closed our global offices, including our corporate headquarters, suspended all company-related travel, and all HubSpot employees globally were required to work from home. We shifted our Solutions Partner events and INBOUND 2020 to virtual-only experiences and have cancelled other customer and industry events. During the third quarter of 2020, we began to slowly re-open our offices on a staggered, region-to-region basis in accordance with local authority guidelines while ensuring that our return to work was thoughtful, prudent, and handled with an abundance of caution with the health of our employees being the top priority. During the fourth quarter of 2020, due to surges in COVID-19 cases at almost all of our office locations, we elected to close all of our global offices. We are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic and will continue to be thoughtful about employee safety and well-being.\nGiven that the economic consequences of the pandemic have been exceptionally challenging for many of our customers and prospects, we also implemented certain changes to our pricing structure in March 2020, including reducing prices on our Starter Growth Suite, offering certain product functionality free of charge for a limited time, suspending marketing email send limits for a limited time, and offering a one-time six-month advance on commissions to certain of our Solutions Partners.\nWhile the pandemic has not had a material adverse financial impact on our business to date, the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance will depend on future developments and conditions. The pandemic and its adverse effects are prevalent in the locations where we, our customers, and partners conduct business. As a result, at the outset of the pandemic, we experienced, and may again experience in the future, curtailed customer demand that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and overall financial performance in future periods. Specifically, we may be impacted by changes in our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our offerings; changes in the timing of our current or prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions; pricing discounts or extended payment terms; reductions in the amount or duration of customers\u2019 subscription contracts; or increased customer attrition rates. While our revenue, customer retention, and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the effect of the pandemic will not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods.\nWhile the implications of the pandemic remain uncertain, we plan to continue to make investments to support business growth. We believe that the growth of our business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to expand our customer base, increase adoption of our CRM Platform within existing customers, develop new products and applications to extend the functionality of our CRM Platform and provide a high level of customer service. We expect to invest in sales and marketing to support customer growth. We also expect to invest in research and development as we continue to introduce new products and applications to extend the functionality of our CRM Platform. We also intend to maintain a high level of customer service and support which we consider critical for our continued success. We plan to continue to invest in our data center infrastructure and services capabilities in order to support continued customer growth. We also expect to continue to incur general and administrative expenses to support our business and to maintain the infrastructure required to be a public company. We expect to use our cash flow from operations and the proceeds from our convertible debt and stock offerings to fund these growth strategies and support our business despite the potential impact from the pandemic and do not expect to be profitable in the near term.\nKey Business Metrics\nThe following key business metrics are presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in our press releases announcing our financial results which are furnished on Form 8-K. We use these key business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business and results of operations, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. These key business metrics may be calculated in a manner different than similar key business metrics used by other companies.\nYear Ended December 31,\nTotal Customers\n103,994\n73,483\n56,628\nTotal Average Subscription Revenue per Customer\n$\n9,582\n$\n9,920\n9,904\nTotal Subscription Dollar Retention Rate\n102.3\n%\n99.9\n%\n100.7\n%\nTotal Customers. We believe that our ability to increase our customer base is an indicator of our market penetration and growth of our business as we continue to expand our sales force and invest in marketing efforts. We define our Total Customers at the end of a particular period as the number of business entities or individuals with one or more paid subscriptions to our CRM Platform either paid directly or through a Solutions Partner. We do not include in Total Customers business entities or individuals with one or more paid subscriptions solely for our legacy Sales Hub ($10) product or any PieSync product. A single customer may have separate paid subscriptions for separate websites, sales licenses or seats, or our Sales Hub, Marketing Hub, Service Hub, or CMS Hub products, but we count these as one customer if certain customer-provided information such as company name, URL, or email address indicate that these subscriptions are managed by the same business entity or individual.\nTotal Average Subscription Revenue per Customer. We believe that our ability to increase the Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer is an indicator of our ability to grow the long-term value of our existing customer relationships. We define Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer during a particular period as subscription revenue, excluding revenue from our legacy Sales Hub ($10) and PieSync products, from our Total Customers during the period divided by the average Total Customers during the same period.\nTotal Subscription Dollar Retention Rate. We believe that our ability to retain and expand a customer relationship is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customers. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our Total Subscription Dollar Retention Rate. We compare the aggregate Total Contractual Monthly Subscription Revenue of our Total Customer base as of the beginning of each month, which we refer to as Total Retention Base Revenue, to the aggregate Total Contractual Monthly Subscription Revenue of the same group of Total Customers at the end of that month, which we refer to as Total Retained Subscription Revenue. We define Total Contractual Monthly Subscription Revenue as the total amount of subscription fees contractually committed to be paid for a full month under all of our Total Customer agreements, excluding any commissions owed to our Solutions Partners. Our Total Subscription Dollar Retention Rate for a given period is calculated by first dividing Total Retained Subscription Revenue by Total Retention Base Revenue for each month in the period, calculating the weighted average of these rates using the Total Retention Base Revenue for each month in the period, and then annualizing the resulting rates.\nKey Components of Consolidated Statements of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from two major sources, revenue from subscriptions to our CRM Platform and professional services and other revenue consisting mainly of on-boarding and training services fees.\nSubscription based revenue is derived from customers using our CRM Platform for their inbound marketing, sales, service, and content management needs. Our CRM Platform features integrated applications that create a cohesive and adaptable customer experience. These integrated applications include a CRM, search engine optimization, blogging, website content management, messaging, chatbots, social media, marketing automation, email, predictive lead scoring, sales productivity, ticketing and helpdesk tools, customer NPS surveys, analytics, and reporting. Subscriptions are billed in advance on various schedules. All subscription fees that are billed in advance of service are recorded in deferred revenue. Subscription based revenue is recognized net of consideration paid to Solutions Partners when those Partners purchase a subscription to our CRM Platform.\nProfessional services and other revenue are derived primarily from customer on-boarding and training services. The on-boarding and training services provided to customers typically involves an implementation specialist. An implementation specialist will typically work with our customers to enhance their understanding of how to attract leads and convert them into customers through search engine optimization, social media, blogging and other content. Training is generally sold in connection with a customer\u2019s initial\nsubscription and is billed in advance. The training is also available to be purchased separately following a customer\u2019s purchase of its initial subscription and our Solutions Partners routinely provide the same training to customers. The Company recognizes revenue from on-boarding and training services as the services are provided.\nCost of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenue\nCost of subscription revenue consists primarily of managed hosting providers and other third-party service providers, employee-related costs including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our customer support team, amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired technology, and allocated overhead costs, which we define as rent, facilities, depreciation of fixed assets, and costs related to information technology.\nCost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel costs of our professional services organization, including salaries, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with our internally built software platform, as well as allocated overhead costs.\nWe expect that cost of subscription and professional services and other revenue will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in growing our business. Over time, we expect to gain benefits of scale associated with our costs of hosting our CRM Platform relative to subscription revenues, resulting in improved subscription gross margin, exclusive of stock-based compensation. We expect professional services and other margins to range from a moderate loss to breakeven for the foreseeable future, exclusive of stock-based compensation.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our development team, including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense and allocated overhead costs. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing new products and adding incremental functionality to our CRM Platform and amortize such costs as costs of subscription revenue over the estimated life of the new product or incremental functionality, which is generally two years. We also capitalize certain development costs that are attributable to developing our internally developed software platforms and amortize such costs throughout the consolidated statement of operations over the estimated life of our internally developed software platforms, which is generally five years. We focus our research and development efforts on improving our products and developing new ones, delivering new functionality and enhancing the customer experience. We believe delivering new functionality for our customers is an integral part of our solution and provides our customers with access to a broad array of options and information critical to their marketing, sales, and customer service efforts. We expect to continue to make investments in and expand our offerings to enhance our customers\u2019 experience and satisfaction and attract new customers. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to increase the functionality of our CRM Platform.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our sales and marketing employees, including sales commissions and incentives, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, marketing programs, including lead generation, costs of our annual INBOUND conference, other brand building expenses, amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with our internally built software platforms, and allocated overhead costs. We defer certain sales commissions related to acquiring new contracts and amortize them ratably over a period of benefit that we have determined to be approximately one to three years. Sales and marketing expenses also include commissions paid to our Solutions Partners in instances where the end customer purchases and pays for a subscription to our CRM Platform.\nWe plan to continue to expand sales and marketing to grow our customer base and increase sales to existing customers. This growth will include adding sales personnel and expanding our marketing activities to continue to generate additional leads and build brand awareness. We expect sales and marketing expenses will increase as a result of hiring net new quota-carrying sales representatives in the United States and worldwide and adding to our marketing staff. Over time, we expect sales and marketing expenses will decline as a percentage of total revenue, exclusive of stock-based compensation.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, human resources, employee-related information technology, administrative personnel, including payroll, benefits and stock-based compensation expense; professional fees for external legal, accounting and other consulting services, amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with our internally built software platforms, and allocated overhead costs. We expect that\ngeneral and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis but decrease as a percentage of total revenue, exclusive of stock-based compensation expense, as we focus on processes, systems and controls to enable our internal support functions to scale with the growth of our business. We also anticipate continuing increases to general and administrative expenses as we incur the costs of compliance associated with being a publicly traded company, including audit and consulting fees.\nOther Expense\nInterest income primarily consists of interest earned on invested cash and cash equivalents balances and investments. Interest expense primarily consists of amortization of the debt discount, issuance costs and contractual interest expense related to our Notes, and the loss on early extinguishment of our 2022 Notes. Other expense primarily consists of the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses associated with monetary assets and liabilities.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe income tax expense consists of current and deferred taxes for U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We have historically had a taxable loss in our most significant jurisdiction, the U.S., and a full valuation allowance against the majority of our deferred tax assets. We expect this to continue in the near term.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth certain consolidated financial data in dollar amounts and as a percentage of total revenue.\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nRevenue:\nSubscription\n$\n853,025\n$\n646,266\n$\n487,450\nProfessional services and other\n30,001\n28,594\n25,530\nTotal revenue\n883,026\n674,860\n512,980\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription\n130,685\n98,510\n69,718\nProfessional services and other\n36,274\n31,448\n30,639\nTotal cost of revenue\n166,959\n129,958\n100,357\nGross profit\n716,067\n544,902\n412,623\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development\n205,589\n158,237\n117,603\nSales and marketing\n452,081\n340,685\n267,444\nGeneral and administrative\n109,225\n92,971\n75,834\nTotal operating expenses\n766,895\n591,893\n460,881\nLoss from operations\n(50,828\n)\n(46,991\n)\n(48,258\n)\nOther expense:\nInterest income\n7,773\n19,429\n9,176\nInterest expense\n(37,049\n)\n(22,818\n)\n(21,386\n)\nOther expense\n(711\n)\n(393\n)\n(1,492\n)\nTotal other expense\n(29,987\n)\n(3,782\n)\n(13,702\n)\nLoss before income tax expense\n(80,815\n)\n(50,773\n)\n(61,960\n)\nIncome tax expense\n(4,216\n)\n(2,973\n)\n(1,868\n)\nNet loss\n$\n(85,031\n)\n$\n(53,746\n)\n$\n(63,828\n)\nYear Ended December 31,\nRevenue:\nSubscription\n%\n%\n%\nProfessional services and other\nTotal revenue\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription\nProfessional services and other\nTotal cost of revenue\nGross profit\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development\nSales and marketing\nGeneral and administrative\nTotal operating expenses\nLoss from operations\n(6\n)\n(7\n)\n(9\n)\nTotal other expense\n(3\n)\n(1\n)\n(3\n)\nLoss before income tax expense\n(9\n)\n(8\n)\n(12\n)\nIncome tax expense\n(0\n)\n(0\n)\n(0\n)\nNet loss\n(10)%\n(8)%\n(12)%\n*\nPercentages are based on actual values.

Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer decreased from $9,920 for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $9,582 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The growth in Total Customers was primarily driven by our increased sales representative capacity to meet market demand as well as our freemium product offering and lower priced starer products. The decrease in average subscription revenue per customer was driven primarily by the volume of continued purchases of our lower priced starter products.\nThe 5% increase in professional services and other revenue resulted primarily from the increase in Total Customers and from the delivery of on-boarding services for the additional subscriptions sold, slightly offset by fewer classroom trainings being held due to social gathering restrictions and travel bans implemented due to the pandemic.\nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\nAmount\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nTotal cost of revenue\n$\n166,959\n$\n129,958\n$\n37,001\n%\nGross profit\n716,067\n544,902\n171,165\n%\nGross margin\n%\n%\nTotal cost of revenue increased 28% during 2020 primarily due to an increase in subscription and hosting costs, employee-related costs, amortization of capitalized software development costs, and allocated overheard expenses, offset by a decrease in amortization of acquired technology due to certain acquired technology reaching the end of its useful life during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Additionally, we saw higher subscription and hosting costs as we focus on the security, reliability and performance of our CRM Platform. Employee-related costs increased as a result of increased headcount as we continue to grow our customer support organization to support our customer growth and improve service levels and offerings, offset slightly by reduced discretionary spending as a result of the pandemic. Amortization of capitalized software development costs increased due to the increased number of developers working on our software platform as we continue to develop new products and increased functionality.

Total Average Subscription Revenue per Customer increased from $9,904 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $9,920 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The growth in Total Customers was primarily driven by our increased sales representative capacity to meet market demand as well as the freemium model.

We believe our working capital is sufficient to support our operations for at least the next 12 months. At December 31, 2020, $83.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held in accounts outside the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we no longer assert indefinite reinvestment of our foreign earnings because these earnings have been subject to U.S. Federal tax. While we have concluded that any incremental tax incurred upon ultimate distribution of these earnings to be immaterial, our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate undistributed earnings to fund our U.S. operations.\nNet Cash and Cash Equivalents Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities consists primarily of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and other non-cash charges, net.\nNet cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily reflected our net loss of $85.0 million, the portion of the repayment of the 2022 Notes attributable to the debt discount of $49.0 million, benefit for deferred income taxes of $2.2 million and accretion of bond discounts of $3.7 million, offset by non-cash expenses that included $37.1 million of depreciation and amortization, $121.5 million in stock-based compensation, $10.5 million of loss on early extinguishment of 2022 Notes and $24.9 million of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. Working capital sources of cash and cash equivalents primarily included a $72.6 million increase in deferred revenue primarily resulting from the growth in the number of customers invoiced during the period, a $26.0 million increase in accrued expenses, a $3.7 million increase in accounts payable related to timing of bill payments, and a $31.4 million increase in right-of-use asset. These sources of cash and cash equivalents were offset by a $31.6 million decrease in lease liabilities, a $30.0 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased billings to customers consistent with the overall growth of the business, $19.3 million increase in deferred commissions and a $17.0 million increase in prepaid and other assets.\nNet cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily reflected our net loss of $53.7 million and accretion of bond discount of $14.2 million offset by non-cash expenses that included $28.8 million of depreciation and amortization, $97.8 million in stock-based compensation, and $21.8 million of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. Working capital sources of cash and cash equivalents primarily included a $49.3 million increase in deferred revenue primarily resulting from the growth in the number of customers invoiced during the period, a $7.8 million increase in accrued expenses, a $3.9 million increase in accounts payable related to timing of bill payments, and a $22.7 million increase in right-of-use asset. These sources of cash and cash equivalents were offset by a $15.8 million decrease in lease liabilities, a $15.4 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased billings to customers consistent with the overall growth of the business, $9.7 million increase in deferred commissions and a $3.3 million increase in prepaid and other assets.\nNet cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflected our net loss of $63.8 million and accretion of bond discount of $6.8 million offset by non-cash expenses that included $23.4 million of depreciation and amortization, $76.3 million in stock-based compensation, $2.3 million of non-cash rent expense and $20.3 million of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.

These sources of cash and cash equivalents were offset by a $17.7 million increase in accounts receivable as a result of increased billings to customers consistent with the overall growth of the business, and a $23.9 million increase in deferred commissions.\nNet Cash and Cash Equivalents Used in Investing Activities\nOur investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases, maturities and sale of investments, property and equipment purchases, an acquisition of a business, strategic investments, and capitalization of software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are related to new products or improvements to our existing software platform that expands the functionality for our customers.\nNet cash and cash equivalents used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of $1.5 billion in purchases of investments, $37.3 million of purchased property and equipment, $2.5 million of purchases of strategic investments, and $21.6 million of capitalized software development costs.

These uses of cash were offset by $644.4 million received related to the maturity of investments.\nNet Cash and Cash Equivalents Provided by Financing Activities\nOur financing activities have consisted primarily of our stock offerings, the various components of our 2025 Notes offering, the various components of our 2022 Notes repayment, the issuance of common stock under our stock plans, payments of employee taxes related to the net share settlement of stock-based awards, and repayments of our finance lease obligations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities consisted of $450.1 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Notes, $363.6 million of proceeds from the settlement of the Convertible Note Hedges related to the 2022 Notes, and $30.4 million of proceeds related to issuance of common stock under stock plans. This source of cash was offset by $236.0 million used for repayment of the 2022 Notes attributable to the principal, $327.5 million for payment to settle the Warrants related to the 2022 Notes, $50.6 million for payment of the Capped Call Options related to the 2025 Notes, and $7.4 million used for payment of employee taxes related to the net share settlement of stock-based awards.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash and cash equivalents provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $342.6 million of net proceeds related to common stock offering and $23.6 million of proceeds related to issuance of common stock under stock plans.

These sources of cash were offset by $8.0 million used for payment of employee taxes related to the net share settlement of stock-based awards and $0.7 million used for repayments of finance leases.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates, assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues, results of operations and net income or loss, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet during and as of the reporting periods. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary because future events and their effects on our results and the value of our assets cannot be determined with certainty and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained, and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which typically include subscriptions to our online software solutions and professional services which include on-boarding and training services. Our customers do not have the right to take possession of the online software products. Revenue from online software products is recognized ratably over the subscription period beginning on the date the online software product is made available to customers. We recognize revenue from on-boarding and training services as the services are provided. Amounts billed that have not yet met the applicable revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue.\nWe allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) of each good or service. We calculate SSP for each type of online software product and professional service offering by averaging the selling price of all purchases within the trailing four calendar quarters. We use four quarters of transaction data to determine SSP as most of our customer arrangements are one year or less and pricing may be subject to change upon each customer\u2019s renewal. In instances where there are not sufficient data points, or the average selling prices for a particular online software product or professional service offering are disparate, we estimate the SSP using other observable inputs, such as similar products or services. If the actual selling price for the sale of an online software product or professional service offering within a multiple performance obligation arrangement substantially differs from the SSP of that offering, we use the relative SSP to allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract with a Customer\nSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental, recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Sales commissions for initial contracts are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit that we have determined to be approximately one to three years. The one to three-year period has been determined by taking into consideration the type of product sold, the commitment term of the customer contract, the nature of the Company\u2019s technology development life-cycle, and an estimated customer relationship period. Sales commissions for upgrade contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated customer relationship period of the related customer.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nSoftware development costs consist of certain payroll and stock compensation costs incurred to develop functionality for our CRM Platform and internally-built software platforms, as well as certain upgrades and enhancements that are expected to result in enhanced functionality. We capitalize certain software development costs for new offerings as well as upgrades to our existing software platforms, while costs associated with planning new developments and maintaining our CRM Platform software and internally built software platforms are expensed as incurred.. We amortize these development costs over the estimated useful life of two to five years on a straight-line basis. We determined that a two- to five- year life is appropriate for our internal-use software based on our best estimate of the useful life of the internally developed software after considering factors such as continuous developments in the technology, obsolescence, and anticipated life of the service offering before significant upgrades. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on a quarterly basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nWe determine the amount of internal software costs to be capitalized based on the amount of time spent by our developers on projects in the application stage of development. There is judgment involved in estimating the time allocated to a particular project in the application stage. A significant change in the time spent on each project could have a material impact on the amount capitalized and related amortization expense in subsequent periods.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease guidance using a modified retrospective transition method applied to those leases which were not completed as of January 1, 2019.\nWe lease office facilities under non-cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through May 2031. Certain leases contain optional termination dates.\nWe determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception and does not separate lease and non-lease components of an arrangement determined to contain a lease. Operating and finance leases with a duration of less than 12 months are excluded from right-of-use-assets and lease liabilities and related expense is recorded as incurred.\nWe use our estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of operating lease payments. To determine the estimated incremental borrowing rate, we use publicly available credit ratings for peer companies. We estimate the incremental borrowing rate using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of the lease payments, which requires judgment.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nContractual obligations are cash that we are obligated to pay as part of certain contracts that we have entered during our course of business. Certain of our leases contain optional termination dates. The table below only includes payments up to the optional termination date. If we were to extend leases beyond the optional termination date, the future commitments would increase by approximately $90.8 million.

    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOur Business\nWe are a digital technology company that provides email and collaboration software, cloud-based identity management platforms, managed web and mobile portals, and advertising solutions. Our customers include communications providers, media companies, government entities and enterprises. We are their trusted partner for enterprise software platforms and monetization solutions that we deliver through public and private cloud software-as-a-service, software licensing, and professional services. Our platforms enable our clients to deepen engagement with their consumers and users.\nOn February 10, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (\"the Merger Agreement\") with CLP SY Holding, LLC (\"Parent\") and SY Merger Sub Corporation an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (\"Purchaser\") an affiliate of Centre Lane Partners, LLC, a New York-based private investment firm, to be acquired in an all-cash transaction that values Synacor, in the aggregate, at approximately $92 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser and Parent on March 3, 2021 commenced a tender offer (the \"Offer\") to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Synacor at a purchase price of $2.20 per share payable net to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law (such consideration as it may be amended from time to time pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the \u201cOffer Price\u201d). The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, as soon as practicable following the acceptance and purchase by Purchaser of the shares of Synacor common stock in the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the \u201cMerger\u201d) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, with the Merger to be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the \u201cDGCL\u201d). Because the Merger will be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL, assuming the requirements of Section 251(h) of the DGCL are met, no vote of the stockholders of the Company will be required to consummate the Merger. As a result of, and at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Synacor common stock not purchased in the Offer (other than (1) shares of Synacor common stock owned by Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or the Company, including all shares of Synacor common stock held by the Company as treasury stock, or (2) shares of Synacor common stock that are held by any stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with the provisions of, Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price from Purchaser.\nProducts and Services\nCloud ID Authentication\nSynacor develops and operates a cloud-based identity and access management platform for large enterprises that runs authentication, user lifecycle management and identity security for our customer\u2019s end users when they need to sign-in to online applications and access their services with networked devices.\nConsumers access their online services and subscription content using a myriad of devices where many find the login process frustrating. Enterprises are challenged to handle the digital identities of tens of millions of consumers and resiliently unlock access during online events that require thousands of verifications per second, often breaking under the load.\nSynacor Cloud ID managed identity services resiliently scale to handle the largest enterprises without requiring customers to install on-premises identity management systems. Cloud ID simplifies the end user experience by offering native single sign on, home-based authentication and device management to reduce login friction and improve security.\nEmail/Collaboration\nOur open and extensible Email/Collaboration platform is used by service providers, regulated entities (government & financial institutions), enterprises, and small and medium sized businesses around the world. Branded as Zimbra, our open-standards-based Email/Collaboration platform powers hundreds of millions of mailboxes globally through our network of over 1,900 channel partners (value-added resellers, or VARs, and Business Service Providers, or BSPs) and about 4,000 licensed customers. Zimbra is delivered as software-as-a-service through public and private cloud infrastructure, and as licensed software. Our Email/Collaboration Services include white-label hosting, security and migration.\nManaged Portals and Advertising\nOur Managed Portals and Advertising solutions provide our customers with substantial revenue opportunities generated by their consumers\u2019 engagement across devices. Our Managed Portals are intended to be daily destinations for consumers and are delivered across devices and under our customers\u2019 own brand names. To help our customers increase their consumers\u2019 engagement, we deliver relevant content, such as top news, entertainment, and long and short-form video and apps, on our Managed Portals. We have licensing and distribution agreements with a wide range of programmers and content and service providers. In addition, consumers have the ability through our portals to manage their email and messaging, pay bills, receive special promotions and perform other account management needs.\nWe monetize the online traffic generated by consumers through search advertising, digital advertising (including video), and syndicated content on our Managed Portals. As we monetize our customers\u2019 online traffic on our Managed Portals, we share a portion of this revenue with our customers, resulting in a mutually beneficial partnership.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy is, with operational and financial discipline, to:\n\u2022increase value for existing customers by optimizing consumer experience and monetization;\n\u2022innovate on Synacor-as-a-platform for advanced services;\n\u2022win new customers in current and related verticals; and\n\u2022extend our product portfolio into emerging growth areas.\nInnovating on Synacor-as-a-platform for advanced services\nOur Cloud ID Authentication platform is reported as having some of the highest consumer login success rates in the industry.\nCloud ID supports four of the top OTT players, simplifying their consumer log-in experiences under extreme traffic loads. Synacor is the leading provider of ISP on-network home-based authentication and Apple Single Sign-On for TV providers. Since 2019, Cloud ID has built on a record of success by delivering highly-scalable authorization of video streaming to enter new markets for consumer identity and access management, now serves 20 million unique users per month. Cloud ID, empowers our clients, in aggregate reaching over 100 million accounts, to utilize Synacor's managed identity services to reliably unlock access for their subscribers in the simplest manner possible and to quickly extend services to new distribution partners and the latest consumer electronics devices.\nWinning new customers in current and related verticals\nWe have an established presence among broadband and pay-TV providers in the U.S. and Canada. Some of these providers use our complete suite of solutions, and others use only certain components. We view this as a growth opportunity within our existing customer base.\nIn 2020, Synacor added 330 new Zimbra Email and Collaboration Suite enterprise and government customers around the world.\nIncreasing value for existing customers by optimizing user experience and monetization\nWith respect to our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions, we have made major upgrades to our portal platform that yield significant benefits. Our new platform has increased page performance by 60% and reduced bounce rate by over 50% on average. Our portal, with its engaging user experience and responsive design for desktop and mobile web, have video threaded throughout and is designed to optimize consumer engagement and monetization. Our latest upgrades increase page performance and deliver a cleaner user experience that results in improved user engagement while decreasing the implementation time for customers to launch and also decreasing the resources necessary to maintain and support the product.\nExtending our product portfolio into emerging growth areas\nWe plan to capitalize on opportunities such as international expansion and delivery of business services. Through our acquisition of the Zimbra assets we have expanded our international customer base, and we believe this represents an opportunity to find new customers for our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions.\nTechnology and Operations\nTechnology Architecture\nOur products leverage technology that is reliable, fault tolerant and scalable through the addition of more servers as usage grows. In 2020 we invested heavily in providing these same capabilities using public cloud technologies. In addition to the existing reliable/fault tolerant infrastructure, cloud technologies enable us to provide self-healing software, auto-scaling, and automated deployments.\nData Center Facilities\nWe currently operate and maintain five data centers in regionally diverse locations and have a network operations center that is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our primary data centers are located in shared facilities in Allen, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Lewis Center, Ohio; Toronto, Canada; and Watertown, Massachusetts. All systems are fully monitored for reporting continuity and fault isolation. The data centers are each in a physically secure facility using monitoring, environmental alarms, closed circuit television and redundant power sources. Our network operations center also is located in a secure facility.\nCustomers\nOur recurring and fee-based customers consist of high-speed internet service providers along with enterprises, government and nonprofit organizations, either directly or through resellers. Contracts with these customers typically have an initial term of one to three years and frequently provide for one or more automatic renewal terms of one to two years each. Our recurring and fee-based customer contracts also typically contain service level agreements that call for specific system \u201cup times\u201d and 24 hours per day, seven days per week support. As of December 31, 2020, we had agreements, both directly and indirectly through resellers, with over 120 high-speed internet service providers and over 4,000 enterprise, government and nonprofit customers.\nOur Managed Portals and Advertising customers principally consist of high-speed internet service providers. Contracts with these customers typically have an initial term of two to three years from the deployment of our Managed Portals and frequently provide for one or more automatic renewal terms of one to two years each.\nContent and Service Providers\nWe license the content available in our Managed Portals, as well as premium services, from numerous third-party content and service partners. These partners provide a variety of content, including news and information, entertainment, video, games, shopping, travel, and finance. Our relationships with content providers give consumers access to over five hundred thousand articles and one million short-form videos each month. To obtain this content, we enter into a variety of licensing arrangements with the content providers. These arrangements are typically one to two years in duration with payment terms that may be based on traffic, advertising revenue share, number of subscribers, flat fee payments over time, or some combination thereof. In addition to using licensed content to populate our Managed Portals, we also provide premium services that subscribers may purchase for additional fees.\nSales and Marketing\nEmail/Collaboration\nWe market our Email/Collaboration product through both direct and indirect sales channels. Our regional sales and marketing teams host several events each year with partners and run various campaigns to generate sales leads. Once a lead has been identified, our internal sales representatives work closely with our regional partners on better identifying the opportunity and gathering customer requirements.\nWe sell to internet service providers primarily through a direct sales force consisting of regional account executives. Sales cycles can be six months or longer. We sell to prospective government, nonprofit and enterprise customers through a two-tier indirect model via more than 1,590 channel partners (VARs and BSPs). Our VARs sell on-premise licenses to end customers while our BSPs sell a cloud service to the end customer. Sales cycles can range from thirty days to six months, depending on size and scope.\nManaged Portals and Advertising Solutions\nSynacor\u2019s managed portal network and publisher-focused advertising platform reaches over 200 million monthly unique visitors. Our advertising solutions enable our customers to earn incremental revenue by monetizing media from their consumers across all popular devices.\nOur advertising sales team sells advertising inventory directly to advertisers and/or to advertising agencies representing those advertisers, as well as employing programmatic ad monetization strategies utilizing ad exchanges via real-time bidding. These advertisers may be small companies with the advertising locally or regionally focused on the Managed Portals of one customer, or large companies with nationwide advertising on the Managed Portals of many customers as well as on our syndicated group of publishers\u2019 sites. We have a team of direct advertising sales employees, independent advertising sales representatives, and programmatic ad specialists focused on this effort and expect to continue to develop this team and attempt to grow the amount of advertising revenue generated with our customers. As of December 31, 2020, we had arrangements with over 100 advertising partners.\nManaged Portals\nOur managed portal network consists of white-labeled browser start pages and iOS/Android start apps that serve as daily destinations for consumers. Powered by our media and programming library which includes news, entertainment, and short and long form video, these products increase consumer engagement and generate advertising revenue. They also provide consumers with self-management capabilities for email and messaging, bill paying and other account management activities.\nSyndicated Advertising\nSynacor\u2019s syndicated advertising platform works with hundreds of publishers to deliver brand-safe monetization that leverages scale, premium brands and programmatic technology across desktop and mobile. We help publishers dynamically target different audiences by matching relevant content to the right users across multiple devices. Publishers also leverage our demand facilitation services to connect premium advertisers and brands with their target audiences on brand-safe sites.\nGovernment Regulation\nAs a cloud-based business serving global video, internet and communications providers, device manufacturers, governments and others, we are required to comply with a variety of laws and other legal obligations. Some jurisdictions, both in the United States and abroad, have enacted or proposed laws and other legal obligations governing, among other things, the internet, online entertainment and other aspects of our businesses. These laws and other legal obligations cover issues such as taxation, pricing, content, distribution, quality and delivery of products and services, electronic contracts, intellectual property rights, and privacy and security of personal information in our possession or under our control.\nFederal laws of the United States that could have an impact on our business include the following: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which is intended to reduce the liability of online service providers of third-party content, including content that may infringe copyrights or other rights of third parties; the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, which imposes restrictions on the ability of online service providers to collect information from children under 13 years of age; and the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act, which requires online service providers to report evidence of violations of federal child pornography laws under certain circumstances.\nThere have been numerous laws and other legal obligations adopted in the United States and around the world regarding privacy and the collection, destruction, protection, sharing, storing, and use of personal information. The impact of these laws and other legal obligations on our business is increasing as more jurisdictions attempt to protect personal information. In light of a rapidly changing legal landscape, as well as rapidly changing technology, these laws and other legal obligations are at times subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent or conflict with laws and other legal obligations of other jurisdictions. While we are committed to remaining in compliance with all laws and other legal obligations, there may be instances when it is problematic to do so.\nThe European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which took effect in May 2018, applies to personal information relating to individuals in the European Union in our possession or under our control. The GDPR includes comprehensive requirements for companies that process such personal information, regardless of the location of the processing, and provides for significant penalties for non-compliance.\nPursuant to the GDPR, personal information relating to individuals in the European Union can only be transferred from the European Union to other countries that have adequate laws and other legal requirements in place to protect such personal information. The European Union has determined that the United States currently does not have adequate laws and other legal requirements in place to protect such personal information. In response, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission adopted the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, and the U.S. Department of Commerce and Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner adopted the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. The purpose of the privacy shields is to enable businesses in the United States that desire to receive transfers of personal information relating to individuals in the European Union to certify to their compliance with the GDPR and other applicable law. However, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u201cCJEU\u201d) invalidated the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, and shortly thereafter, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner questioned the validity of the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. In doing so, the CJEU suggested that U.S. businesses could use other methods available under the GDPR for meeting the so-called \u201cadequacy requirement\u201d (e.g. standard contractual clauses and binding corporate rules), but it is possible that, in applying the same analysis used in invalidating the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, the CJEU could at some point invalidate these other methods as well.\nWe initially certified to being in compliance with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield in December 2016 and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield in June 2017, and have renewed our certifications each year thereafter. We currently plan on renewing our certifications for the foreseeable future, in addition to, or in lieu of, using any other method available under the GDPR for complying with the \u201cadequacy requirement\u201d to continue transferring personal information from the European Union to the United States.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020, requires certain businesses to, among other things, provide (1) certain data relating to their collection and use of personal information of California consumers, (2) data access and deletion rights to California consumers, and (3) California consumers with the right to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. While it remains unclear how some provisions of the CCPA will be interpreted, significant penalties can be imposed for non-compliance with the CCPA or data breaches. The California Attorney General began enforcing the CCPA as of July 1, 2020, and has adopted detailed regulations to clarify some of its provisions.\nThe California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCPRA\u201d), which was recently passed, but is not effective until January 1, 2023, supplements and enhances the CCPA. Due to the requirements of the CPRA, many businesses have already begun to comply with its terms. The CPRA requires stricter protection of consumer privacy, similar to the GDPR, and imposes privacy and data security requirements for businesses. In addition, the CPRA establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency as an \u201cindependent watchdog,\u201d vested with \u201cfull administrative power, authority, and jurisdiction to implement and enforce the [CPRA].\u201d\nThere are currently pending a number of legislative proposals in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions that could impose additional obligations affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement. In addition, some countries and other jurisdictions are considering, or have passed, legislation that mandates local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services.\nWe strive to comply with all applicable laws and other legal obligations, company policies, and industry-standard codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. Compliance with any such applicable laws and other legal obligations, company policies, and industry-standard codes of conduct (including, but not limited to, the GDPR and the CCPA) could require us to incur additional costs and expenses. At the same time, the failure to comply with such applicable laws and other legal obligations, company policies, and industry-standard codes of conduct could result in governmental enforcement actions, significant damages and fines being imposed on us, loss of the ability to transfer E.U. personal data to the United States, litigation, restrictions on our and our customers\u2019 ability to market products and services, uncertainty of internet usage, reductions in the demand for our products and services, and mandatory changes to our privacy and data security practices, as well as our products and services.\nIntellectual Property\nWe believe that the protection of our intellectual property is critical to our success. We rely on copyright, trademark and patent enforcement, contractual restrictions and trade secret, trade dress and domain name laws to protect our brand and other proprietary and intellectual property rights. We have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and nondisclosure agreements and other agreements containing confidentiality protections with certain parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure of, our proprietary information and technology, such as trade secrets, confidential information, know-how and technical information. We have applied for patents to protect certain of our intellectual property. In addition, we have acquired intellectual property, including patents and trademarks, through our acquisitions including Zimbra, Technorati, NimbleTV and Teknision. We have three trademark registrations in the United States for SYNACOR (U.S. Registration Numbers 5108679, 2845578 and 2811272).\nWe endeavor to protect our internally-developed systems and maintain our trademarks. We generally control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and our software is protected by United States and international copyright laws.\nIn addition to legal protections, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, new product developments, frequent product enhancements and reliable product support and services are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position.\nCompetition\nThe market for internet-based services and products in which we operate is highly competitive and involves rapidly-changing technologies and customer and consumer requirements, as well as evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. While we believe that our technology offers considerable value and flexibility to our customers by helping them to extend their consumer relationships to a wide variety of internet-based services, we face competition at four levels:\n\u2022When one of our prospective or existing customers considers another supplier, including one of our partners, for elements of the services or products which we provide.\n\u2022When consumers choose to rely on other vendors for similar products and services.\n\u2022When content and service providers prefer to establish direct relationships with one or more of our customers.\n\u2022When one of our customers decides to make the significant headcount and technology investment to develop products and services in-house similar to those that we provide.\nOur technology competes primarily with high-speed internet service providers that have internal information technology staff capable of developing similar solutions in-house.\nEmail/Collaboration\nWith respect to our Email/Collaboration solutions, we compete primarily with Google and Microsoft in the enterprise and government markets, and with Open-Xchange and OpenWave in the internet service provider markets.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in the email/collaboration market include a company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022provide customers the ability to perform security and compliance audits of our source code;\n\u2022deliver anti-spam, anti-phishing, anti-virus and encryption technologies;\n\u2022provide products and services at lowest possible total cost of ownership (TCO);\n\u2022provide local partners the ability to store data within the legal jurisdiction of the country where their customers do business;\n\u2022provide an enterprise-ready solution suitable for large-scale deployments including such enterprise features such as delegated administration, detailed logging, and performance and availability transparency;\n\u2022offer access to real-time performance and availability statistics;\n\u2022afford customers and partners the ability to rebrand their cloud collaboration experience; and\n\u2022make available to partners both integrations and extensions to the collaboration cloud environment specific to customers\u2019 needs.\nWe believe that we distinguish ourselves from potential competitors in several ways. First, we offer our Email/Collaboration products and services a la carte, enabling customers to buy only the services they need, providing for a much lower TCO. Second, our Zimbra Email/Collaboration solution is a complete feature-rich, enterprise-ready solution scalable up to 40 million mailboxes. Finally, our products are customizable and extendable and designed to meet very high standards of security.\nManaged Portals and Advertising Solutions\nIn addition, with respect to our Managed Portals and Advertising solutions, we compete with companies such as Facebook, Inc.; Google; Verizon Media; and MSN, a division of Microsoft Corporation, or Microsoft, which have destination websites of their own or are capable of delivering content, service offerings and search or advertising models similar to ours.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include a company\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022reinforce the brands of our cable, satellite, telecom and consumer electronics customers;\n\u2022produce products that are flexible and easy to use;\n\u2022offer competitive fees for Managed Portal development and operation;\n\u2022generate additional revenue for our customers;\n\u2022enable our customers to be involved in designing the \u201clook and feel\u201d of their online presence;\n\u2022offer services and products that meet the changing needs of our customers and their consumers, including emerging technologies and standards;\n\u2022provide high-quality product support to assist the customer\u2019s service representatives; and\n\u2022aggregate content to deliver more compelling bundled packages of paid content.\nWe believe that we distinguish ourselves from potential competitors in three principal ways. First, we provide a white-label solution that, unlike the co-branded approach of most of our competitors, creates a consumer experience that reinforces our customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 brands. Second, we give customers control over the sign-on process and billing function for a wide range of internet services and content by integrating with their internal systems (where applicable) thereby allowing our customers to \u201cown the consumer.\u201d Finally, our solutions are flexible and neutral, meaning that we allow deliverables that are customized to our customers\u2019 specific needs.\nHuman Capital Resources\nDue to the specialized nature of our business, our performance depends on identifying, attracting, developing, motivating, and retaining a highly skilled workforce.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 142 employees in the United States and 131 based internationally. Of these employees, 270 were full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider current employee relations to be good.\nDiversity and inclusion are a business imperative for us, as we believe it is key to our future success. We have focused our diversity and inclusion initiatives on employee recruitment, outreach, and employee training and development, such as expanding the diverse talent pipeline and employee engagement. Through these and other focused efforts, we have improved the diversity of our overall workforce and within leadership positions, specifically in the representation of women, people of color, and people with disabilities.\nCorporate Information\nSynacor\u2019s predecessor company was originally formed as a New York corporation, and in November 2002, Synacor re-incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our headquarters are located at 40 La Riviere Drive, Buffalo, New York 14202, and our telephone number is (716) 853-1362.\nAvailable Information\nOur internet website address is http://www.synacor.com.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the information set forth in \u201cSelected Financial Data\u201d and our financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon our current expectations, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements due to, among other considerations, the matters discussed under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nBusiness Overview\nSynacor is a digital technology company that provides email and collaboration software, cloud-based identity management platforms, managed web and mobile portals, and advertising solutions. Our customers include communications providers, media companies, government entities and enterprises. We are their trusted partner for enterprise software platforms and monetization solutions that we deliver through public and private cloud software-as-a-service, software licensing, and professional services. Our platforms enable our clients to deepen engagement with their consumers and users.\nOn February 10, 2021, we had entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (\"the Merger Agreement\") with CLP SY Holding, LLC (\"Parent\") and SY Merger Sub Corporation an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (\"Purchaser\") an affiliate of Centre Lane Partners, LLC, a New York-based private investment firm, to be acquired in an all-cash transaction that values Synacor, in the aggregate, at approximately $92 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Purchaser and Parent on March 3, 2021 commenced a tender offer (the \"Offer\") to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Synacor at a purchase price of $2.20 in share payable net to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law (such consideration as it may be amended from time to time pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the \u201cOffer Price\u201d). The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, as soon as practicable following the acceptance and purchaser by Purchaser of the shares of Synacor common stock in the Offer, Purchaser will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the \u201cMerger\u201d) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, with the Merger to be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the \u201cDGCL\u201d). Because the Merger will be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL, assuming the requirements of Section 251(h) of the DGCL are met, no vote of the stockholders of the Company will be required to consummate the Merger. As a result of, and at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of Synacor common stock not purchased in the Offer (other than (1) shares of Synacor common stock owned by Parent, Purchaser or the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or the Company, including all shares of Synacor common stock held by the Company as treasury stock, or (2) shares of Synacor common stock that are held by any stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with the provisions of, Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price from Purchaser.\nThe Company operates its business in two reportable segments: 1) Software & Services and 2) Portal & Advertising. A summary of the major products and services of our reportable segments follows:\nSoftware & Services:\nSynacor\u2019s Software & Services segment is comprised of our cloud-based identity management platform and our Zimbra email & collaboration platform.\nCloud-based Identity Management\nOur Cloud ID platform provides secure, scalable authentication and authorization that enables consumers to easily unlock access to content and services. It enables single sign-on access to services such as Over The Top (OTT) video, TV Everywhere streaming video and audio, email, web access customer account information, and other consumer and enterprise apps. Cloud ID is delivered as a platform-as-a-service through public and private cloud infrastructure.\nEmail / Collaboration\nSynacor delivers an open and extensible email & collaboration platform used by service providers, regulated entities (government and financial institutions), enterprises, and small and medium sized businesses around the world. Branded as Zimbra, our open-standards-based email collaboration platform powers hundreds of millions of mailboxes globally through our network of more than 1,900 channel partners (value-added resellers, or VARs, and Business Service Providers, or BSPs) and about 4,000 licensed customers. Zimbra is delivered as software-as-a-service through public and private cloud infrastructure, and as licensed software.\nPortal & Advertising:\nSynacor\u2019s managed portal network and publisher-focused advertising platform reaches over 200 million monthly unique visitors. These solutions enable our customers to earn incremental revenue by monetizing media from their consumers across all popular devices.\nManaged Portals\nOur managed portal network consists of white-labeled browser start pages and iOS/Android start apps that serve as daily destinations for consumers. Powered by our media and programming library which includes news, entertainment, and short and long form video, these products increase consumer engagement and generate advertising revenue. They also provide consumers with self-management capabilities for email and messaging, bill paying and other account management activities.\nPublisher Focused\nSynacor\u2019s publisher focused advertising platform works with hundreds of publishers to deliver brand-safe monetization that leverages scale, premium brands and programmatic technology across desktop and mobile. We help publishers dynamically target different audiences by matching relevant content to the right users across multiple devices. Publishers also leverage our demand facilitation services to connect premium advertisers and brands with their target audiences on brand-safe sites.\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on our Results and Operations\nAt the beginning of 2020, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged and by March 11, 2020 was declared a global pandemic by The World Health Organization. Across the United States and the world, governments and municipalities instituted measures in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, school closings, travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential businesses. By the end of March, the macroeconomic impacts became significant, exhibited by, among other things, a rise in unemployment and market volatility.\nBeginning mid-March 2020, Synacor implemented a work from home policy for nearly all of its employees other than a few providing on-site customer technical support. Being in an industry where telecommuting is very common, Synacor has been able to perform all normal business activities with minimal impact on productivity. Synacor will continue this work from home policy until it is determined to be safe for employees to return to work in our offices. Our work from home requirement will be reassessed on July 5, 2021.\nThe global macroeconomic impacts due to the pandemic have caused some delays in closing new software subscriptions and renewals. The delays were largely seen in our third quarter results of the Software & Services segment. Our Portal & Advertising segment has been negatively impacted with advertising revenue down due to a sharp decline in advertising spending, which began in March 2020 and continued throughout the second quarter of 2020. Although we have seen some market improvement in advertising spending starting in the third quarter of 2020, our revenues are still significantly lower as compared to the same periods in 2019. We have, however, seen an improvement in advertising margins as we have progressed through the last half of the year which have returned back to more normal levels.\nTo mitigate these impacts on our business, Synacor has taken actions to reduce costs and preserve liquidity, including instituting a hiring freeze, reducing discretionary spending and minimizing capital spending. We also took steps during the second quarter of 2020 to improve our advertising margins with lower CPMs (or cost-per-thousand-impressions) and an increased number of revenue share arrangements. Synacor continues to believe that the COVID-19 related impacts on our business will be temporary.\nCost Reduction Program\nOn August 4, 2020, the Company initiated a cost reduction program as a result of ongoing reviews of our business and operations. These actions are expected to result in approximately $10 million of annual cost savings when fully implemented. Of this total, $5.9 million relates to lower headcount and benefits costs due to position eliminations and a reduction in force, which has already been implemented. In addition, we expect $1.7 million in savings from data center closures, $1.4 million from facility reductions, and $1.0 million from other operating expense and cost of revenue reductions. In the third quarter of 2020, we recognized restructuring charges associated with this cost reduction program of $1.1 million related to severance and facilities expenses. These restructuring costs are included in technology and development ($0.6 million), sales and marketing ($0.4 million) and general and administrative ($0.1 million). In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recognized restructuring charges associated with this cost reduction program of $0.3 million related to severance and facility expenses. The cost savings as a result of these actions realized in the third quarter of 2020 were $0.8 million, and in the fourth quarter of 2020 were $1.2 million. We expect to achieve 90% of the total cost savings by the end of 2021.\nAs a result of this program, we did incur impairment charges related to operating lease right-of-use assets associated with certain leased office spaces the Company ceased using, as well as furniture and fixtures associated with those facilities.\nFinancial Highlights\nHighlights and significant developments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020\n\u2022Net loss was $11.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA* was $5.3 million, or 6.5% of revenue, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020\n\u2022Operating expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased 28% from the prior year to $41.7 million\n\u2022Cash from operating activities was $1.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020\nThe initiatives described below under \u201cKey Initiatives\u201d are expected to contribute to our ability to maintain and grow revenue and return Synacor to operating profitability.\n* We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus: provision (benefit) for income taxes, interest expense, other (income) expense, depreciation and amortization, asset impairments, stock-based compensation, restructuring costs, and certain legal and professional services fees. Please see \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d below for more information and for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $(11.6) million, and $(9.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTrends Affecting Our Business\nSoftware & Services\nOur current customers and new prospects require authentication services to manage the complexity of new business rules. With consumers having more choice for video consumption via traditional video packages to a la carte offerings and direct to consumer offerings, the demand for Cloud ID authentication across multiple platforms and providing a simplified single sign on solution for the end user is in high demand.\nMore and more companies are leveraging highly scalable global SaaS solutions to enable staff to use the same integrated enterprise application in order to achieve massive economies of scale, while maintaining their respective security and compliance objectives. We have also reached a tipping point in the industry where businesses are more receptive to cloud-based SaaS solutions than the traditional on-premised software deployments. As such, our success is dependent on our ability to help these businesses realize improved efficiency, personalization and security brought about by recent technological advancements.\nPortal & Advertising\nOur customers in the Portal & Advertising segment, predominantly high-speed internet service providers that also offer television services, are facing increasing competition from companies that deliver video content over the internet, more commonly referred to as \u201cover-the-top,\u201d or OTT. These competitors include a number of large companies, most notable being Google. With the increased availability of high-speed internet access and over-the-top programming, consumers\u2019 video content consumption preferences may shift away from current viewing habits.\nAnother trend affecting our customers and our business is the proliferation of internet-connected devices, especially mobile devices. Smartphones, tablets and connected TVs have made it more convenient for consumers to access services and content online, including television programming. To remain competitive, our customers and potential customers must have the capability to deliver their services and products to consumers on all devices. Our technology enables them to extend their presence beyond traditional personal computers.\nOur business is also affected by growth in advertising on the internet, for which the proliferation of high-speed internet access and internet-connected devices have been and will continue to be the principal drivers. We believe we have experienced a decline in advertising revenue due to consumers\u2019 internet searching habits increasingly transitioning to mobile devices. However, our focus on publisher based advertising has resulted in an increase in advertising revenue. In addition, we believe there continue to be growth opportunities for advertising related to the video, images and text on our Managed Portals and hosted email/collaboration products.\nKey Initiatives\nOur strategy is supported by four key pillars to drive our business, with operational discipline and sound financial footing as its base. We plan to:\n\u2022increase value for existing customers by optimizing consumer experience and monetization;\n\u2022innovate on Synacor-as-a-platform for advanced services;\n\u2022win new customers in current and related verticals; and\n\u2022extend our product portfolio into emerging growth areas.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1, The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of our operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized according to ASC 606, Revenue - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company generates all of its revenue from contracts with customers. Many of the Company\u2019s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices of software licenses are typically estimated using the residual approach. Standalone selling prices of services are typically estimated based on observable transactions when these services are sold on a standalone basis. The Company usually expects payment within 30 to 90 days from the invoice date (fulfillment of performance obligations or per contract terms). Differences between the amount of revenue recognized and the amount invoiced are recognized as deferred revenue. None of the Company\u2019s contracts as of December 31, 2020 or 2019 contained a significant financing component.\nThe following is a description of principal activities from which the Company generates revenue in each reportable segment. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to the Company\u2019s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.\nSoftware & Services\nSynacor\u2019s software and services segment is comprised of our cloud-based identity management platform and our Zimbra email & collaboration platform. Subscription fees and other fees are received from customers for the use of the Company\u2019s proprietary technology, including the use of, or access to, email, Cloud ID, security services, games and other premium services. Monthly subscriber levels typically form the basis for generating recurring and fee-based revenue. This revenue is typically determined by multiplying a per-subscriber per-month fee by the number of subscribers using the particular services being offered or consumed, except in the case of software licenses and support, which are based on a fixed fee. Revenue earned as subscription fees and maintenance and support fees is recognized from customers as its obligation to deliver the service is satisfied, which is when the service is delivered. Revenue is also recognized from the licensing and distribution of the Company\u2019s Email/Collaboration products and services, including licenses of intellectual property. Software license revenue is recognized up front upon delivery of the licensed product and the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys, provided that a signed contract has been received. The Company typically sells term-based software licenses that expire, which are referred to as subscription licenses, but also sell perpetual licenses for its Email products. The software is delivered before related services are provided and is functional without professional services, updates, and technical support.\nPortal & Advertising\nThe Company uses internet advertising to generate revenue from the traffic on its Managed Portals and Advertising solutions, categorized as search advertising and digital advertising. For search advertising, the Company has a revenue-sharing relationship with Google, pursuant to which the Company includes a Google-branded search tool on its Managed Portals. For revenue earned under this relationship the Company evaluates whether it is the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). When a Google consumer makes a search query using this tool, the Company delivers the query to Google and they return search results to consumers that include advertiser-sponsored links. If the consumer clicks on a sponsored link, Google receives payment from the sponsor of that link and shares a portion of that payment with the Company. The payment received from Google is recognized as revenue. Digital advertising includes video, image and text advertisements delivered on its Managed Portals. Advertising inventory is filled with advertisements sourced by the Company\u2019s direct sales force and advertising network partners. Revenue is generated when an advertisement displays, otherwise known as an impression, or when consumers view or click an advertisement, otherwise known as an action. Digital advertising revenue is on a cost per impression or cost per action basis. Digital advertising also includes advertising fees received for the placement of syndicated digital advertisements with other digital advertising publishers, for which the Company acquires and pays for the space (inventory) on a cost per impression or cost per action basis. Revenue is recognized based on amounts received from advertising customers as the impressions are delivered or the actions occur, according to contractually-determined rates.\nSoftware Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes certain costs incurred for the development of internal use software, as well as the costs of developing software for sale or license to customers. Internal use software includes the Company\u2019s proprietary portal software and related applications, Cloud ID authentication software, and various applications used in the management of the Company\u2019s portals. Software for sale or license to customers includes the Company\u2019s proprietary Email/Collaboration offerings. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage for internal software programs are expensed as incurred. External and internal costs incurred during the application development stage (subsequent to the achievement of technological feasibility on software to be sold or licensed) of new software development, as well as for upgrades and enhancements for software programs that result in additional functionality are capitalized. Software development costs capitalized for sale or license to customers and costs capitalized for the development of internal use software are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software. Impairment charges are taken as a result of circumstances that indicate that the carrying values of the assets were not fully recoverable. The Company utilizes the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of the internal use software.The Company utilizes the net realizable value model to determine the recoverability of software for sale or license to customers. Impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in amount (in thousands) and as a percentage of revenue for those periods. The period to period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nRevenue $ 81,362 $ 121,845\nCosts and operating expenses:\nCost of revenue (1) 42,236 61,990\nTechnology and development (1) (2) 12,007 18,273\nSales and marketing (2) 15,350 21,790\nGeneral and administrative (1) (2) 14,356 17,734\nDepreciation and amortization 8,068 9,865\nTotal costs and operating expenses 92,017 129,652\nLoss from operations (10,655) (7,807)\nOther income (expense), net 240 (17)\nInterest expense (189) (268)\nLoss before income taxes (10,604) (8,092)\nProvision for income taxes 957 929\nNet loss $ (11,561) $ (9,021)\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nRevenue 100 % 100 %\nCost of revenue (1) 52 51\nTechnology and development (1) (2) 15 15\nSales and marketing (2) 19 18\nGeneral and administrative (1) (2) 18 15\nDepreciation and amortization 10 8\nTotal costs and operating expenses 114 107\nLoss from operations (14) (6)\nOther expense, net 1 -\nInterest expense - -\nLoss before income taxes (13) (7)\nProvision for income taxes 1 1\nNet loss (14) % (7) %\nNotes:\n(1)Exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately.\n(2)Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nTechnology and development $ 218 $ 338\nSales and marketing 407 513\nGeneral and administrative 831 765\n$ 1,456 $ 1,616\nIncluded in the above results of operations was the following restructuring expense:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nCost of revenue $ 12 $ 234\nTechnology and development 533 370\nSales and marketing 420 246\nGeneral and administrative 518 109\nTotal restructuring expense $ 1,483 $ 959\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenue decreased by $40.5 million, or 33%, in 2020 compared to 2019, attributable to an overall decline of $0.2 million in Software & Services revenue and a decline of $40.3 million in Portal & Advertising revenue.\nCost of revenue decreased $19.8 million, or 32%, in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in cost was primarily due to the decline in revenue, cost reductions and a change in the mix of revenues.\nTechnology and development expenses decreased by $6.3 million, or 34%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower compensation expense of $5.2 million, lower software license cost of $0.8 million, and lower discretionary spending of $0.3 million.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased by $6.4 million, or 30%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily the result of lower compensation expenses of $4.9 million, lower travel costs of $0.8 million, and lower professional services fees of $0.4 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $3.4 million, or 19%, in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily the result of lower compensation expense of $0.9 million, lower impairment charges of $1.0 million, lower facilities costs of $0.7 million, lower travel costs of $0.3 million, lower bad debt expense of $0.4 million, and lower professional services fees of $0.4 million, offset by higher computer software costs of $0.3 million.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased by $1.8 million, or 18%, in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by lower costs related to data centers.\nOther income (expense), net consists of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to our international operations. The decrease in expense of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was due to unrealized foreign currency transaction gains.\nInterest expense decreased by $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, when compared to 2019 primarily due to lower interest incurred on finance leases.\nProvision for income taxes of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 respectively, is comprised primarily of current foreign income tax expense, including foreign withholding taxes, offset by deferred income tax benefit.\nSegment Results of Operations\nThe Company operates its business in two reportable segments: 1) Software & Services and 2) Portal & Advertising.\nThe following are Revenue, Segment Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands) and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin by reportable segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted for certain non-cash items and other non-recurring income and expenses. Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA is equal to Adjusted EBITDA, which is a metric that is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Refer to \u201cAdjusted EBITDA\u201d below for a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to net loss, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is the primary performance measure used by our senior management, the chief operating decision-maker and the board of directors to evaluate operating results and allocate capital resources among segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Segment Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of Segment Revenue. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $(11.6) million, and $(9.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\nRevenue:\nSoftware & Services $ 44,280 $ 44,485\nPortal & Advertising 37,082 77,360\nTotal Revenue $ 81,362 $ 121,845\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA:\nSoftware & Services $ 14,340 $ 12,531\nPortal & Advertising 2,168 10,657\nCorporate Unallocated Expense (11,190) (13,685)\nTotal Segment Adjusted EBITDA $ 5,318 $ 9,503\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA Margin:\nSoftware & Services 32.4 % 28.2 %\nPortal & Advertising 5.8 % 13.8 %\nTotal Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin 6.5 % 7.8 %\nSoftware & Services\nRevenue in 2020 remained essentially flat when compared to 2019, decreasing by $0.2 million. Recurring revenue (revenue recognized over time) decreased $1.0 million, primarily due to COVID-19 related declines in consumer email accounts and a video product line which was discontinued in the second quarter of 2019. Non-recurring revenue (revenue recognized at a point in time) increased $0.8 million primarily due to higher professional services revenue of $1.7 million, which more than offset COVID-19 related impacts on email license and maintenance revenue.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 increased by $1.8 million to $14.3 million, or 14%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to lower operating expenses due to cost reductions implemented during the year, which more than offset the impact of lower revenue. As a result, the Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin increased to 32.4% compared to 28.2% in 2019.\nPortal & Advertising\nRevenue in 2020 decreased by $40.3 million, or 52%, when compared to 2019. Recurring revenue was down $2.0 million primarily due to the expected decline in portal and premium service fees. Non-recurring revenue was down $38.2 million of which $26.6 million was due to the loss of a significant portal customer at the end of the third quarter of 2019. In addition, advertising revenue declined when compared to last year due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 decreased $8.5 million, or 80%, compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of lower revenue which was only partially offset by lower operating expenses. As a result, the Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased to 5.8% compared to 13.8% in 2019.\nCorporate Unallocated Expense\nCorporate Unallocated Expense primarily includes corporate overhead costs, such as payroll and related benefit costs, rent expense and professional services fees which are not directly attributable to an individual segment. Corporate Unallocated Expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 by $2.5 million, or 18%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in Corporate Unallocated Expense is primarily a result of lower professional service fees of $0.7 million, lower facilities costs of $1.0 million, lower travel costs of $0.2 million and lower compensation costs of $0.8 million, partially offset by higher computer software costs of $0.2 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed within this Annual Report on Form 10-K adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided a reconciliation below of adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe have included adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure used by the compensation committee of our board of directors in connection with the payment of bonuses to our executive officers. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nOur use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization and asset impairments are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated, amortized or impaired may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of principal or interest payments required to service our finance leases or long-term debt borrowings (if any);\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of the cost of business acquisitions on the cash available to us;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of non-recurring items, such as the costs associated with reductions in workforce on the cash available to us: and\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, adjusted EBITDA should be considered alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other U.S. GAAP results. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss for each of the periods indicated:\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2020 2019\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA:\nNet loss $ (11,561) $ (9,021)\nProvision for income taxes 957 929\nInterest expense 189 268\nOther income (expense), net (240) 17\nDepreciation and amortization 10,294 11,251\nLong-lived asset impairment* 806 1,751\nStock-based compensation expense 1,456 1,616\nRestructuring costs** 1,483 959\nCertain legal and professional services fees*** 1,934 1,733\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 5,318 $ 9,503\nNotes:\n* \"Long-lived asset impairment\" includes impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment, capitalized software and leased assets.\n** \"Restructuring costs\" include severance expense, contract termination costs and other exit or disposal costs.\n*** \"Certain legal and professional services fees\" includes legal fees and other related expenses outside the ordinary course of business, as well as fees and expenses related to merger and acquisition activities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity and capital resource requirements are for financing working capital, investing in capital expenditures such as computer hardware and software, supporting research and development efforts, introducing new technology, enhancing existing technology, and marketing our services and products to new and existing customers.\nTo the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash from operations, cash from short-term borrowings, and cash from the exercise of stock options are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings or debt financings.\nIn August 2019, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, (the \"Agreement\"), with Silicon Valley Bank (the \"Lender\"). The Lender agreed to provide a $12.0 million secured revolving line of credit (the \u201ccredit facility\u201d). The credit facility is available for cash borrowings, subject to a Borrowing Base formula based upon eligible accounts receivable. The maturity of the Agreement is two years from the date of the Agreement. Any borrowings under the Agreement bear interest, based on an interest rate dependent on cash liquidity for the relevant period. Cash liquidity is defined as cash plus (a) the lesser of (i) the Revolving Line or (ii) the amount available under the Borrowing Base minus (b) the outstanding principal balance of any Advances, (each as defined in the Agreement). If cash liquidity is greater than $20.0 million then the interest rate is the greater of the \"prime rate\u201d as published in The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) for the relevant period plus 0.50%, which as of December 31, 2020 would be 5.50%. If cash liquidity is less than $20.0 million then the interest rate is the greater of WSJ prime rate plus 1.00% which as of December 31, 2020 would be 6.00%. The Agreement requires compliance with certain reporting requirements, conditions, and covenants. The financial covenants require that we must maintain a Minimum Liquidity Coverage (as defined in the Agreement) greater than or equal to 2.25:1.00. Additionally, when cash liquidity falls below $20.0 million, the Agreement includes certain trailing six month Free Cash Flow requirements, tested on a quarterly basis. Free Cash Flow is defined in the Agreement as (a) Adjusted EBITDA, minus (b) capital expenditures determined in accordance with GAAP, minus (c) capitalized software expenses, determined in accordance with GAAP, and minus (d) cash taxes, determined in accordance with GAAP. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Agreement, and we had $8.2 million of availability based upon the borrowing formula under the Agreement.\nOn April 30, 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment (the \"Amendment\") to the Agreement. The Amendment changed the date from April 30, 2020 to May 31, 2020 for which the minimum Free Cash Flow target proposed by the Lender is to be agreed upon by the Company, as defined by the Agreement, with respect to any period from September 30, 2020 through and including December 31, 2020. On May 27, 2020, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Agreement, which reset the Free Cash Flow covenant level for the period ended June 30, 2020 and set the Free Cash Flow covenant levels for the periods ending September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020.\nOur obligations to the Lender are secured by a first priority security interest in all our assets, including our intellectual property. The Agreement contains customary events of default, including non-payment of principal or interest, violations of covenants, material adverse changes, cross-default, bankruptcy and material judgments. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Lender may accelerate repayment of any outstanding balance. The Agreement also contains certain financial covenants and other agreements that are customary in loan agreements of this type, including restrictions on paying dividends and making distributions to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants and anticipate continuing to be so.\nWe began taking advantage of the option to defer remittance of the employer portion of social security tax at the end of April 2020 as provided for under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, (\"CARES Act\"). This deferral enabled us to retain approximately $0.6 million in cash during 2020, which would otherwise have been remitted to the federal government. Under the terms of the CARES Act, half of the cumulative deferred tax payment amount for 2020 will be remitted at the end of 2021 with the remaining half at the end of 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $5.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with cash flows from operations and availability under our revolving credit line, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital, interest payments, capital lease payment obligations and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nCash Flows\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019\n(in thousands)\nStatements of Cash Flows Data:\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 1,038 $ 2,459\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (3,053) $ (3,772)\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (3,159) $ (3,459)\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year 2020 of $1.0 million was primarily driven by a net loss of $11.6 million, cash used in working capital and other net assets of $0.1 million offset by $12.7 million of non-cash charges including depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year 2019 of $2.5 million was primarily driven by a net loss of $9.0 million, cash used in working capital and other net assets of $3.5 million offset by $15.0 million of non-cash charges including depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expense.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nOur primary investing activities have consisted of capitalized software and purchases of computer equipment.

The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nOn October 9, 2020, the Company and White River SPV, entered into a Participation Agreement (the \u201cParticipation Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, White River SPV, BlackBrush Oil & Gas, L.P. (\u201cBlackBrush\u201d) and GeoTerre, LLC, an unrelated privately-held limited liability company (the \u201cAssignor\u201d), to conduct drilling of wells in the Austin Chalk formation.\nPursuant to the Participation Agreement, the Company and White River SPV have agreed, among other things, to pre-fund a majority of the cost, approximately $5,800,000, associated with the drilling and completion of an initial deep horizontal well in the Austin Chalk formation of which $3,387,000 has been expensed as drilling costs. The Participation Agreement requires the estimated amount of the drilling costs that were paid into a designated escrow account by the commencement of drilling in January 2021. BlackBrush has agreed to assign to the other parties to the Participation Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and limitations specified therein, specified portions of its leasehold working interest in certain Austin Chalk formation units. The Participation Agreement provides for an initial allocation of the working interests and net revenue interests among the assignor, BlackBrush and the Company and then a re-allocation upon payout or payment of drilling and completion costs for each well drilled. Prior to payout, the Company will own 90% of the working interest and 67.5% of the net revenue interest in each well. Following payout, the Company will own 70% of working interest and 52.5% net revenue interest in each well.\nThe Parties to the Participation Agreement, except for the Company, had previously entered into a Joint Operating Agreement, dated September 4, 2020 (the \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d) establishing an area of mutual interest, including the Austin Chalk formation, and governing the parties\u2019 rights and obligations with respect to drilling, completion and operation of wells therein. The Participation Agreement and the Operating Agreement require, among other things, that White River SPV and the Company drill and complete at least one horizontal Austin Chalk well with a certain minimum lateral each calendar year and/or maintain leasehold by paying its proportionate share of any rental payments.\nActive drilling commenced on January 15, 2021 and on January 31, 2021 the drilling reached its targeted location in the Austin Chalk formation. On February 13, 2021, the drilling had reached its first milestone which initiated a contractual vesting of asset assignments with the successful drilling of a minimum lateral distance of 2,500 feet. On February 14, 2021, we reached its second milestone, with the conclusion of drilling of a lateral with a full vertical section distance of 4,046 feet. The well was drilled successfully using managed pressure drilling techniques, allowing for visibility of the productive intervals throughout the drilling process in the Austin Chalk.\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company and White River Energy, LLC (\u201cWhite River Energy\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into three asset purchase agreements (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreements\u201d) with privately-held limited liability companies to acquire working interests in the Harry O\u2019Neal oil and gas mineral lease (the \u201cO\u2019Neal OGML\u201d), the related well bore, crude oil inventory and equipment. Immediately prior to the acquisition, White River Energy owned an approximately 61% working interest in the O\u2019Neal OGML oil well and a 100% working interest in any future wells.\nThe purchase prices of these leases were $126,000, $312,000 and $312,000, respectively, totaling $750,000. The consideration paid to the Sellers was in the form of 68,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nIn February and March 2021, the Company acquired additional leases for $916,000 under the Blackbrush/Deshotel lease related to the Participation Agreement.\nReverse Stock Split\nEffective with the opening of trading on December 17, 2020, the Company implemented a one-for-five reverse split of its issued and outstanding common stock and a simultaneous proportionate reduction of its authorized common stock. The reverse stock split was effected without obtaining stockholder approval as permitted by Nevada law, and the authorized common stock was proportionately reduced to 40,000,000 shares. All share and per share figures are reflected on a post-split basis herein.\nRatification of Authorized Capital Increase\nAt the special meeting held on December 29, 2020, the stockholders of the Company ratified the previously approved increase of the number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue from 20,000,000 shares to 40,000,000 shares.\nAuthorized Capital Reduction\nEffective December 29, 2020, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to reduce its authorized common stock from 40,000,000 to 30,000,000.\nRegistered Direct Offering of Common Stock and Warrants\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company completed a registered direct offering, whereby the Company issued 889,000 shares of common stock and 889,000 accompanying warrants to purchase common stock to one institutional investor under the effective Form S-3 at $9.00 per share and accompanying warrant for a total of $8,000,000 in gross proceeds, before placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The warrants are exercisable for a two-year term at a strike price of $10.00 per share. The Company granted 62,000 warrants to the placement agent as compensation in addition to the $560,000 cash commission received by the placement agent. The placement agent warrants are exercisable at $11.25 per share and expire on January 2, 2023.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 303 Pearl Parkway, Suite 200, San Antonio, TX 78215, and our telephone number is (800) 762-7293.

However, it did have a material impact on our management\u2019s ability to operate effectively. The impact included the difficulties of working remotely from home including slow Internet connection, the inability of our accounting and financial officers to collaborate as effectively as they would otherwise have in an office environment and issues arising from mandatory state quarantines.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to estimate with sufficient certainty the continued impact that COVID-19 could have on the Company\u2019s business, future outbreaks and the measures taken by federal, state, local and foreign governments could disrupt the operation of the Company\u2019s business. The COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures have also had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global and domestic economic conditions, including the reducing demand for oil, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition, including on its potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. In addition, the Company has taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to its employees, including temporarily requiring employees to work remotely, and discouraging employee attendance at in-person work-related meetings, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak may impact the Company\u2019s results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact.\nThe Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) includes, among other things, provisions relating to payroll tax credits and deferrals, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credits and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act also established a Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), whereby certain small business are eligible for a loan to fund payroll expenses, rent and related costs. We have received funding under the PPP, and a majority of that as indicated in our Consolidated Statement of Operations has been forgiven.\nDescription of Business\nBanner Midstream Corp\nThrough its indirect wholly-owned operating subsidiaries Pinnacle Frac, Capstone, White River, and Shamrock, the Company is engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, and drilling operations on over 20,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, as well as transportation of frac sand and logistics services to major hydraulic fracturing and drilling operations, and procurement and financing of equipment to oilfield transportation service contractors.\nThe Company entered the oil and gas industry following the previously disclosed acquisition of Banner Midstream Corp. on March 27, 2020.\nZest Labs\nThrough its wholly-owned subsidiary Zest Labs, the Company offers freshness management solutions for fresh food growers, suppliers, processors, distributors, grocers and restaurants. Its Zest Fresh solution is a cloud-based post-harvest shelf-life and freshness management solution that improves delivered freshness of produce and protein and reduces post-harvest losses at the retailer due to temperature handling and processing by 50% or more by intelligently matching customer freshness requirements with actual product freshness. It focuses on four primary value propositions - operational efficiency, consistent food freshness, reduced waste, and improved food safety. Zest Fresh empowers workers with real-time analytic tools and alerts that improve efficiency while driving quality consistency through best practice adherence at a pallet level. Zest Labs also offers its Zest Delivery solution that provides real-time monitoring and control for prepared food delivery containers, helping delivery and dispatch personnel ensure the quality and safety of delivered food.\nOn June 6, 2019, Zest Labs announced a strategic collaboration between AgroFresh and Zest Labs to strengthen their end-to-end solutions. AgroFresh will incorporate Zest Labs\u2019 Zest Fresh\u2122 solution into its FreshCloud\u2122 Transit Insights platform. The agreement will utilize both companies\u2019 resources and strengths to provide customers with a comprehensive solution that improves operations, increases visibility into produce shelf-life and reduces food waste.\nZest Labs was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 23, 2004.\nThe Zest Fresh value proposition is to reduce fresh food loss by improving quality consistency. In the U.S. produce market, it is reported that roughly 30% of post-harvest fresh food is lost or wasted and therefore not consumed. Both fresh food producers and retailers bear significant expense when harvested food is either rejected due to early spoilage or reduced in value due to early ripening. Zest Labs believes that a significant portion of this waste can be attributed to inconsistent quality or freshness based on variable post-harvest processing and handling. Fresh food producers and retailers manage food distribution and inventory based on the harvest date, with the assumption that all food harvested on the same day will have the same freshness. However, studies have shown that harvest conditions and post-harvest handling can have a significant effect on the actual remaining freshness and, if not properly accounted for, can result in food loss or spoilage ahead of expectations. Zest Fresh empowers fresh food producers and retailers to significantly reduce the post-harvest loss by providing real-time guidance to process adherence, intelligent distribution and best handling practices, with a goal of providing significant financial savings to fresh food producers and retailers.\nZest Labs has developed the industry\u2019s first freshness metric called the Zest Intelligent Pallet Routing Code (\u201cZIPR Code\u201d). The ZIPR Code has three main components: (i) Harvest Quality which sets total freshness capacity (for example, 12 days for strawberries), (ii) Handling Impact which reflects aging acceleration due to improper handling, and (iii) Future Handling which accurately reflects how the product will be handled (for example, store shelf temperature may be 40 degrees Fahrenheit instead of the ideal 34 degrees Fahrenheit).\nZest Fresh is offered to fresh food producers, processors, distributors, restaurants and grocers with pricing based on the number of pallets managed by Zest Fresh, typically from the field harvest through retail grocery delivery. The Zest Fresh service includes a re-usable wireless Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) condition sensor that travels with the pallet of fresh food from the field or processor through retail delivery, continuously collecting product condition data. The collected pallet product data is analyzed, using artificial intelligence-based predictive analytics in real time by the Zest Fresh cloud-based solution, with the fresh food producers and retailers accessing data through Zest Fresh web and mobile applications. Zest Fresh provides workers with real-time feedback on the current handling or processing of each pallet, empowering best practice adherence to achieve maximum freshness. Zest Fresh also provides dynamic updates as to actual product freshness for each pallet, enabling intelligent routing and inventory management of each pallet in a manner that ensures optimum delivered freshness. Zest Fresh also includes integrated blockchain support to grower and shipper customers via the Zest Fresh platform.\nZest Labs\u2019 Zest Delivery solution helps to manage prepared food delivery from the restaurant through to the customer. Zest Delivery manages the delivery container environment, both monitoring and controlling the product condition. The value of Zest Delivery is to manage prepared meals in an ideal state for consumption, while accommodating extended pre-staging or delivery times. Extended pre-staging times are associated with \u201cinstant delivery\u201d services of prepared meals, where the meals are often pre-staged in a delivery area ahead of demand. While pre-staging enables fast demand response time, it can result in prepared meals being staged for extended periods, which can potentially impact quality, value and safety. Zest Delivery monitors and controls the delivery container environment to preserve the prepared meal in ideal, ready to consume condition. Zest Delivery also provides the dispatcher with real-time remote visibility to the condition of available meals and confirming quality prior to dispatch. Zest Delivery provides automated, real-time visibility for a very distributed fleet of drivers, reflecting prepared meal food safety, quality and availability. Zest Delivery is offered to meal delivery companies based on the quantity of delivery containers and frequency of use.\nZest Labs currently holds rights to 75 U.S. patents (with additional patents pending), numerous related foreign patents, and U.S. copyrights relating to certain aspects of its Zest software, hardware devices including Radio-Frequency Identification (\u201cRFID\u201d) technology, software, and services. In addition, Zest Labs has registered, and/or has applied to register trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for \u201cIntelleflex,\u201d the Intelleflex logo, \u201cZest,\u201d \u201cZest Data Services,\u201d and the Zest, Zest Fresh and Zest Delivery logos, and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Many of Zest Labs\u2019 products have been designed to include licensed intellectual property obtained from third-parties. Laws and regulations related to wireless communications devices in the jurisdictions in which Zest Labs operates and seeks to operate are extensive and subject to change. Wireless communication devices, such as RFID readers, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates.\nAlthough most components essential to Zest Labs\u2019 business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including, but not limited to, microprocessors, enclosures, certain RFID or other wireless custom integrated circuits, and application-specific integrated circuits are currently obtained by Zest Labs from single or limited sources, principally in Asia.\nZest Labs is part of a very competitive industry that markets solutions to fresh food supply chain users, such as fresh food growers, producers and retailers. Many other companies that are both more established and command much greater resources compete in this market. While Zest Fresh and Zest Delivery offer new technical approaches and new user value, it remains uncertain if Zest Labs will gain sufficient adoption of its products to make them viable in the market. Further, it is unclear what industry competitors are developing that might address similar user needs. Zest Labs\u2019 products provide a new approach for industry participants, and as with any new approach, adoption is uncertain as many in the industry can be slow to embrace new technology and/or new approaches. These market challenges can lead to extended sales cycles that may include extended pilot testing often at Zest Labs\u2019 expense, for which the outcome remains unclear until the completion of each test. For these reasons, and others, forecasting new business adoption and future revenue can be very difficult and volatile; however, the Company believes that Zest Fresh offers fresh food retailers, growers, shippers, processors and distributors an opportunity to differentiate their businesses in ways that the shipment of canned and boxed food products cannot, as competition in the agriculture, grocery, food service and restaurant markets continues to accelerate.\nOur ability to execute our strategy with respect to our freshness management solutions depends in part on the outcome of the litigation related to protection of our intellectual property rights. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for more information.\nTrend Capital Management\nBefore we acquired Trend Holdings in May 2019 by merging Trend Holdings with and into the Company, Trend Holdings was a financial services holding company with two primary subsidiaries: Trend Discovery Capital Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\u201cTrend Capital Management\u201d), and Barrier Crest, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\u201cBarrier Crest\u201d).\nTrend Capital Management was founded in 2011 and was Trend Holding\u2019s primary asset. Trend Capital Management provides services and collects fees from entities including Trend LP and Trend SPV, both of which invest in securities. Trend Capital Management neither invests in securities nor have any role in Trend LP and Trend SPV\u2019s purchase of securities. The investment capital in Trend LP and Trend SPV is from individual limited partners, and not from the Company.\nIn the near-term, Trend LP\u2019s performance will be driven by its investment in Volans-i, a fully autonomous vertical takeoff and landing drone delivery platform (\u201cVolans\u201d). Trend LP currently owns approximately 1% of Volans and has participation rights to future financings to maintain such ownership at 1% indefinitely. More information can be found at website. www.flyvoly.com, the contents of which are not incorporated into this report.\nBarrier Crest provides fund administration and fund formation services to institutional investors. Barrier Crest provides fund administration services to Trend LP and Trend SPV.\nCompetition\nThe Company faces intense competition with respect to its products and services in all markets in which it operates.\nIn the oil and gas industry, we are producing and selling crude oil as a commodity so we compete against. All producers including individual well owners through the supermajor oil companies. Some of these competitors at the major and supermajor categories possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources are relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.\nThe market for cloud-based, real-time supply chain analytic solutions-the market in which Zest Labs competes-is highly competitive and is rapidly evolving. There are several new competitors with competing technologies, including companies that have greater resources than Ecoark Holdings, which operate in this space. Some of these companies are subsidiaries of large publicly traded companies that have brand recognition, established relationships with retailers, and own the manufacturing process.\nTrend Holdings and its subsidiaries have significant competition from larger companies with greater assets and resources.\nSales and Marketing\nThrough Banner Midstream and its subsidiaries, the Company sells and provides services to its customers via a blanket master services agreement (MSA). Banner Midstream sells hydrocarbon to midstream providers such as Plains Marketing L.P. and Shell Trading (US) Company.\nThe Company markets its technology products and services principally through direct sales efforts and the utilization of third-party agents. Zest Labs has marketing operations and programs for demand generation, public relations, and branding/messaging that are scaled based on market engagement and available resources.\nTrend Holdings and its subsidiaries provide fund administration and fund formation services to institutional investors and market their services through private marketing.\nGovernment Regulations\nBanner Midstream\nOil and gas production is regulated under a wide range of federal and state statutes, rules, orders and regulations. State and federal statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states in which we operate, Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico (the \u201cTerritory\u201d), have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, the regulation of spacing, and requirements for plugging and abandonment of wells. Also, states in the Territory impose a severance tax on production and sales of oil, and gas within its jurisdiction. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.\nZest Labs\nLaws and regulations related to wireless communications devices in the jurisdictions in which Zest Labs seeks to operate are extensive and subject to change. Wireless communication devices, such as RFID readers, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies. These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates. The Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d), is responsible for the assignment of spectrum for non-government use in the United States in accordance with regulations established by an international organization known as the International Telecommunications Union (the \u201cITU\u201d). Any ITU or FCC reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, could cause interference with the reception of GPS signals and may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of Zest Labs\u2019 products, which would, in turn, cause a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nEnvironmental Compliance Expenses\nWe are currently not experiencing any material expenses related to the environmental compliance.

Through Ecoark Holdings wholly owned subsidiaries, the Company has operations in three areas: (i) oil and gas, including exploration, production and drilling operations on over 20,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi and transportation services, (ii) post-harvest shelf-life and freshness food management technology, and (iii) financial services including investing in a select number of early stage startups. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries include Banner Midstream, White River, Shamrock, Pinnacle Frac, Capstone, Zest Labs and Trend Holdings.\nThrough Pinnacle Frac the Company provides transportation of frac sand and logistics services to major hydraulic fracturing and drilling operations. Capstone procures and finances equipment to oilfield transportation service contractors. These two operating subsidiaries of Banner Midstream are revenue producing entities.\nThrough White River and Shamrock, we are engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, and drilling operations on over 20,000 cumulative acres of active mineral leases in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.\nWhile the Company\u2019s consolidated financial information for the fiscal ended March 31, 2021 reflects the operating results of Banner Midstream which currently comprises the Company\u2019s exploration and production and transportation business, Banner Midstream\u2019s operating results are not included in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial information for the fiscal ended March 31, 2020. The operating results of Trend Holdings are included in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial information beginning May 31, 2019.\nFiscal Year 2021 Highlights\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, the Company focused its efforts to a considerable extent on expanding its exploration and production footprint and capabilities by acquiring real property and working interests in oil and gas mineral leases.\nOn June 11, 2020, the Company acquired certain energy assets from SR Acquisition I, LLC for $1 as part of the ongoing bankruptcy reorganization of Sanchez Energy Corporation. The transaction includes the transfer of 262 total wells in Mississippi and Louisiana, approximately 9,000 acres of active mineral leases, and drilling production materials and equipment. The 262 total wells include 57 active producing wells, 19 active disposal wells, 136 shut-in with future utility wells, and 50 shut-in pending plugging wells. Included in the assignment are 4 wells in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale formation.\nOn June 18, 2020, the Company acquired certain energy assets from SN TMS, LLC for $1 as part of the ongoing bankruptcy reorganization of Sanchez Energy Corporation. The transaction includes the transfer of wells, active mineral leases, and drilling production materials and equipment.\nOn August 14, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, White River E&P LLC, a Texas Limited Liability Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Rabb Resources, LTD. and Claude Rabb, the sole owner of Rabb Resources, LTD. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Rabb Resources, LTD. The acquired assets consisted of certain real property and working interests in oil and gas mineral leases. The Company in June 2020 previously provided for bridge financing to Rabb Resources, LTD under the $225 Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note. As consideration for entering into the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Rabb Resources, LTD. A total of $3,500 consisting of (i) $1,500 in cash, net of $304 in outstanding amounts related to the note receivable and accrued interest receivable, and (ii) $2,000 payable in common stock of the Company, which based on the closing price of the common stock as of the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement equaled 103 shares. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the Rabb Resources, LTD historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nOn September 4, 2020, White River SPV 3, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banner Midstream entered into an Agreement and Assignment of Oil, Gas and Mineral Lease with a privately held limited liability company (the \u201cAssignor\u201d). Under the Lease Assignment, the Assignor assigned a 100% working interest (75% net revenue interest) in a certain oil and gas lease covering in excess of 1,600 acres (the \u201cLease\u201d), and White River paid $1,500 in cash to the Assignor. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nOn October 9, 2020, the Company and White River SPV, entered into a Participation Agreement (the \u201cParticipation Agreement\u201d) by and among the Company, White River SPV, BlackBrush Oil & Gas, L.P. (\u201cBlackBrush\u201d) and GeoTerre, LLC, an unrelated privately-held limited liability company (the \u201cAssignor\u201d), to conduct drilling of wells in the Austin Chalk formation.\nPursuant to the Participation Agreement, the Company and White River SPV have agreed, among other things, to pre-fund a majority of the cost, approximately $5,800, associated with the drilling and completion of an initial deep horizontal well in the Austin Chalk formation of which $3,387 has been expensed as drilling costs. The Participation Agreement requires the estimated amount of the drilling costs that were paid into a designated escrow account by the commencement of drilling in January 2021. BlackBrush has agreed to assign to the other parties to the Participation Agreement, subject to certain exceptions and limitations specified therein, specified portions of its leasehold working interest in certain Austin Chalk formation units. The Participation Agreement provides for an initial allocation of the working interests and net revenue interests among the assignor, BlackBrush and the Company and then a re-allocation upon payout or payment of drilling and completion costs for each well drilled. Prior to payout, the Company will own 90% of the working interest and 67.5% of the net revenue interest in each well. Following payout, the Company will own 70% of working interest and 52.5% net revenue interest in each well.\nThe Parties to the Participation Agreement, except for the Company, had previously entered into a Joint Operating Agreement, dated September 4, 2020 (the \u201cOperating Agreement\u201d) establishing an area of mutual interest, including the Austin Chalk formation, and governing the parties\u2019 rights and obligations with respect to drilling, completion and operation of wells therein. The Participation Agreement and the Operating Agreement require, among other things, that White River SPV and the Company drill and complete at least one horizontal Austin Chalk well with a certain minimum lateral each calendar year and/or maintain leasehold by paying its proportionate share of any rental payments.\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company and White River Energy, LLC (\u201cWhite River Energy\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into three asset purchase agreements (the \u201cAsset Purchase Agreements\u201d) with privately-held limited liability companies to acquire working interests in the Harry O\u2019Neal oil and gas mineral lease (the \u201cO\u2019Neal OGML\u201d), the related well bore, crude oil inventory and equipment. Immediately prior to the acquisition, White River Energy owned an approximately 61% working interest in the O\u2019Neal OGML oil well and a 100% working interest in any future wells.\nThe purchase prices of these leases were $126, $312 and $312, respectively, totaling $750. The consideration paid to the Sellers was in the form of 68 shares of common stock. The Company accounted for this acquisition as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 and that the Company has early adopted the amendments of Regulation S-X dated May 21, 2020 and has concluded that this acquisition was not significant. Accordingly, as a result of the amendment, the presentation of the historical financial statements under Rule 3-05 and related pro forma information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X, respectively, were not required to be presented.\nIn February and March 2021, the Company acquired additional leases for $916 under the Blackbrush/Deshotel lease related to the Participation Agreement.\nReverse Stock Split\nEffective with the opening of trading on December 17, 2020, the Company implemented a one-for-five reverse split of its issued and outstanding common stock and a simultaneous proportionate reduction of its authorized common stock. The reverse stock split was effected without obtaining stockholder approval as permitted by Nevada law, and the authorized common stock was proportionately reduced to 40,000 shares. All share and per share figures are reflected on a post-split basis herein.\nRatification of Authorized Capital Increase\nAt the special meeting held on December 29, 2020, the stockholders of the Company ratified the previously approved increase of the number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue from 30,000 shares to 40,000 shares.\nAuthorized Capital Reduction\nEffective December 29, 2020, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to reduce its authorized common stock from 40,000 to 30,000.\nRegistered Direct Offering of Common Stock and Warrants\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company completed a registered direct offering, whereby the Company issued 889 shares of common stock and 889 accompanying warrants to purchase common stock to one institutional investor under the effective Form S-3 at $9.00 per share and accompanying warrant for a total of $8,000 in gross proceeds, before placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The warrants are exercisable for a two-year term at a strike price of $10.00 per share. The Company granted 62 warrants to the placement agent as compensation in addition to the $560 cash commission received by the placement agent. The placement agent warrants are exercisable at $11.25 per share and expire on January 2, 2023.\nOur principal executive offices are located at 303 Pearl Parkway, Suite 200, San Antonio, TX 78215, and our telephone number is (800) 762-7293.

Our website and the information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in and are not considered part of this report.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on the U.S. and global economy and may continue to affect the economy and the industries in which we operate, depending on the vaccine rollouts and the emergence of virus mutations.\nCOVID-19 did not have a material effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations or the Consolidated Balance Sheets included in this Form 10-K. However, it did have a material impact on our management\u2019s ability to operate effectively. The impact included the difficulties of working remotely from home including slow Internet connection, the inability of our accounting and financial officers to collaborate as effectively as they would otherwise have in an office environment and issues arising from mandatory state quarantines.\nWhile it is not possible at this time to estimate with sufficient certainty the continued impact that COVID-19 could have on the Company\u2019s business, future outbreaks and the measures taken by federal, state, local and foreign governments could disrupt the operation of the Company\u2019s business. The COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures have also had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global and domestic economic conditions, including reducing the demand for oil, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition, including on its potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. In addition, the Company has taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to its employees, including temporarily requiring employees to work remotely, and discouraging employee attendance at in-person work-related meetings, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts the Company\u2019s results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact.\nThe CARES Act includes, among other things, provisions relating to payroll tax credits and deferrals, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credits and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act also established a Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), whereby certain small business are eligible for a loan to fund payroll expenses, rent and related costs. We had received funding under the PPP, and a majority of that as indicated in our Consolidated Statement of Operations has been forgiven.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions\nThe critical accounting policies listed below are those the Company deems most important to their operations.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include, but are not limited to, management\u2019s estimate of provisions required for uncollectible accounts receivable, fair value of assets held for sale and assets and liabilities acquired, impaired value of equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill, asset retirement obligations, estimates of discount rates in lease, liabilities to accrue, fair value of derivative liabilities associated with warrants, cost incurred in the satisfaction of performance obligations, permanent and temporary differences related to income taxes and determination of the fair value of stock awards.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe estimates of proved, probable and possible oil and gas reserves are used as significant inputs in determining the depletion of oil and gas properties and the impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of quantities of proven, probable and possible reserves and in the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. Similarly, evaluations for impairment of proved and unproved oil and gas properties are subject to numerous uncertainties including, among others, estimates of future recoverable reserves and commodity price outlooks. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized.\nOil and Gas Properties\nThe Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and natural gas properties. Under the full cost method of accounting, all costs associated with acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves, including directly related overhead costs are capitalized. General and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred.\nAll capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves, are amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves. Disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas, in which case the gain or loss is recognized in operations. Unproved properties and development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs. If the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired, the amount of the loss from operations before income taxes and the adjusted carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit-of-production method.\nLimitation on Capitalized Costs\nUnder the full-cost method of accounting, we are required, at the end of each reporting period, to perform a test to determine the limit on the book value of our oil and gas properties (the \u201cCeiling\u201d test). If the capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, exceed the Ceiling, the excess or impairment is charged to expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher oil and gas prices may subsequently increase the Ceiling. The Ceiling is defined as the sum of: (a) the present value, discounted at 10% and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, of (1) estimated future gross revenues from proved reserves, which is computed using oil and gas prices determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month hedging arrangements pursuant to SAB 103, less (2) estimated future expenditures (based on current costs) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves; plus, (b) the cost of properties being amortized; plus, (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized; net of (d) the related tax effects related to the difference between the book and tax basis of our oil and natural gas properties.\nOil and Gas Reserves\nReserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and interpretation thereof, including evaluations and extrapolations of well flow rates and reservoir pressure. Estimates by different engineers often vary sometimes significantly. In addition, physical factors such as results of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate, as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices, may justify revision of such estimates. Because proved reserves are required to be estimated using recent prices of the evaluation, estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices.\nInventories\nCrude oil, products and merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost (last-in-first-out (LIFO)) or net realizable value. Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location.\nAccounting for Asset Retirement Obligation\nAsset retirement obligations (\u201cARO\u201d) primarily represent the estimated present value of the amount the Company will incur to plug, abandon and remediate its producing properties at the projected end of their productive lives, in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws. The Company determined its ARO by calculating the present value of the estimated cash flows related to the obligation. The retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the obligation\u2019s inception, with an offsetting increase to proved properties or to exploration costs.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\nThe Company accounts for a contract when it has been approved and committed to, each party\u2019s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred have been identified, the payment terms have been identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability is probable. Revenue is generally recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nRevenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the elements.\nRevenue from software license agreements of Zest Labs is recognized over time or at a point in time depending on the evaluation of when the customer obtains control of the promised goods or services over the term of the agreement. For agreements where the software requires continuous updates to provide the intended functionality, revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement. For software as a service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) contracts that include multiple performance obligations, including hardware, perpetual software licenses, subscriptions, term licenses, maintenance and other services, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on estimates of the price that would be charged to the customer for each promised product or service if it were sold on a standalone basis. For contracts for new products and services where standalone pricing has not been established, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on estimates using the adjusted market assessment approach, the expected cost plus a margin approach or the residual approach as appropriate under the circumstances. Contracts are typically on thirty-day payment terms from when the Company satisfies the performance obligation in the contract. The Company did not have material revenue from software license agreements in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRevenue under master service agreements is recorded upon the performance obligation being satisfied. Typically, the satisfaction of the performance obligation occurs upon the frac sand load being delivered to the customer site and this load being successfully invoiced and accepted by the Company\u2019s factoring agent.\nThe Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606 when: (i) the Company receives notification of the successful sale of a load of crude oil to a buyer; (ii) the buyer will provide a price based on the average monthly price of crude oil in the most recent month; and (iii) cash is received the following month from the crude oil buyer.\nThe Company accounts for contract costs in accordance with ASC Topic 340-40, Contracts with Customers. The Company recognizes the cost of sales of a contract as expense when incurred or at the time a performance obligation is satisfied. The Company recognizes an asset from the costs to fulfil a contract only if the costs relate directly to a contract, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying a performance obligation in the future and the costs are expected to be recovered. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized unless the costs would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained.\nCost of sales for Pinnacle Frac includes all direct expenses incurred to produce the revenue for the period. This includes, but is not limited to, direct employee labor, direct contract labor and fuel.\nFair Value Measurements\nASC 820 Fair Value Measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. ASC 820 classifies these inputs into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1 inputs: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 inputs: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\nLevel 3 inputs: Instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers.\nSegment Information\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 280-10 Segment Reporting. This standard requires that companies disclose operating segments based on the manner in which management disaggregates the Company in making internal operating decisions. The Company and its chief operating decision makers determined that the Company\u2019s operations effective with the May 31, 2019, acquisition of Trend Holdings and the March 27, 2020 acquisition of Banner Midstream now consist of three segments, Trend Holdings (Finance), Banner Midstream (Commodities) and Zest Labs (Technology).\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. Management evaluates all of the Company\u2019s financial instruments, including warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. The Company generally uses a Black-Scholes model, as applicable, to value the derivative instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates when needed. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The Black-Scholes model is used to estimate the fair value of the derivative liabilities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contract\u2019s in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. The ASU simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2021, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU 2021-04 \u201cEarnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815- 40) Issuer\u2019s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options\u201d which clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer\u2019s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. An entity should measure the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as follows: i) for a modification or an exchange that is a part of or directly related to a modification or an exchange of an existing debt instrument or line-of-credit or revolving-debt arrangements (hereinafter, referred to as a \u201cdebt\u201d or \u201cdebt instrument\u201d), as the difference between the fair value of the modified or exchanged written call option and the fair value of that written call option immediately before it is modified or exchanged; ii) for all other modifications or exchanges, as the excess, if any, of the fair value of the modified or exchanged written call option over the fair value of that written call option immediately before it is modified or exchanged. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the amendments prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company does not discuss recent pronouncements that are not anticipated to have an impact on or are unrelated to its financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020\nAs the Company acquired Trend Holdings and Banner Midstream during the year ended March 31, 2020 the latter of which was acquired on March 27, 2020, many of the variances between operating revenues and operating expenditures are the result of these acquisitions and the periods are not comparable.\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 were $15,563 as compared to $581 for the year ended March 31, 2020, an increase of $14,982. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the oil and gas operations as the result of the Banner Midstream acquisition on March 27, 2020. Revenues were comprised of $478 and $175 in the financial segment; $0 and $173 in the technology segment; and $15,085 and $233 in the commodity segment for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Profit\nCost of revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $14,727 as compared to $259 for the year ended March 31, 2020, an increase of $14,468. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the oil and gas operations as the result of the Banner Midstream acquisition on March 27, 2020. Cost of Revenues was comprised of $0 and $0 in the financial segment; $0 and $165 in the technology segment; and $14,727 and $94 in the commodity segment for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Gross margins decreased from 45% for the year ended March 31, 2020 to 5% for the year ended March 31, 2021 due to costs involved with executing the projects and changes in inventory of crude oil.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 were $19,437 as compared to $10,129 for the year ended March 31, 2020, an increase of $9,308. Operating expenses were comprised of $476 and $729 in the financial segment; $3,415 and $9,330 in the technology segment; and $15,546 and $70 in the commodity segment for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The $9,308 increase was due principally to the expenses, including wages and consulting fees, related to the addition of the oil and gas operations as the result of the Banner Midstream acquisition on March 27, 2020 and the depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion for Banner Midstream in 2021 and 2020, partially offset by the reduction in the Zest Labs selling expenses.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 were $8,405 compared with $1,370 for the year ended March 31, 2020. Cost reduction initiatives were focused on salary related and professional fees for the technology segment offset by the costs incurred for Banner Midstream as this was acquired in March 2020.\nDepreciation, Amortization, Depletion and Accretion\nDepreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion expenses for the year ended March 31, 2021 were $1,902 compared to $286 for the year ended March 31, 2020. Depreciation, amortization, depletion and accretion expenses were comprised of $0 and $0 in the financial segment; $250 and $282 in the technology segment; and $1,652 and $4 in the commodity segment for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The $1,616 increase resulted primarily from the acquisition of Banner Midstream and the depletion and accretion is the result of the oil and gas properties maintained by Banner Midstream. The technology and financing segment do not have depletion or accretion.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense decreased 64% to $883 in the year ended March 31, 2021 compared with $2,472 in the year ended March 31, 2020. The $1,589 reduction in costs related primarily to the maturing of development of the Zest Labs freshness solutions.\nOther Income (Expense)\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities for the year ended March 31, 2021 was a non-cash loss of ($18,518) as compared to a non-cash loss of ($369) for the year ended March 31, 2020. The $18,149 decrease was a result of the fluctuation in the stock price in the year ended March 31, 2021 compared to the year ended March 31, 2020. In addition, there was a non-cash gain in the year ended March 31, 2021 from the extinguishment of the derivative liabilities that when converted to shares of common stock of $21,084 compared to ($2,099) in the prior year. In the year ended March 31, 2021, there was a non-cash loss on the conversion of debt and other liabilities to shares of common stock of $3,969, a gain on forgiveness of debt of PPP loans of $1,850 and a loss on the sale of fixed assets and abandonment of oil and gas properties of $105 and $109, respectively.\nInterest expense, net of interest income, for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $2,520 as compared to $422 for the year ended March 31, 2020. The increase was the result of the interest incurred on the debt assumed in the Banner Midstream acquisition as well as the value related to the granting of warrants for interest of $2,042 and the amortization of debt discount of $149.\nNet Loss\nNet loss from continuing operations for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $20,888 as compared to $12,137 for the year ended March 31, 2020. The $8,751 increase in net loss was primarily due to the non-cash changes in the fair value of the derivative liability and the non-cash losses incurred on the conversion of debt to equity, offset by the non-cash gain on the exchange of warrants for common stock and forgiveness of debt of the PPP loans described herein. The net income (loss) was comprised of ($15) and ($554) in the financial segment; ($3,502) and ($11,637) in the technology segment; and net loss of ($17,371) and $52 in the commodity segment for the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. Significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations, levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable and capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in operating activities was ($12,639) for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to net cash used in operating activities of ($5,490) for the year ended March 31, 2020. Cash used in operating activities is related to the Company\u2019s net loss partially offset by non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation and the change in the fair value of the derivative liability and net losses incurred in the conversion of debt and liabilities to shares of common stock as well as losses on the sale of fixed assets and abandonment of oil and gas properties.\nNet cash used in investing activities was ($6,358) for the year ended March 31, 2021, as compared to ($775) net cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2020. Net cash used in investing activities in 2021 related to the advancement of a note receivable of $275, and the net purchases of fixed assets and oil and gas properties including drilling costs of $2,697.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $19,907 that included $24,287 (net of fees) raised via issuance of common stock in a direct registered offering, stock for the exercise of warrants and stock options, offset by proceeds and repayments of long-term debt and notes payable including related parties of $4,380. This compared with the year ended March 31, 2020 amounts of $6,427 provided by financing that included $1,137 provided through the credit facility, $2,000 from the exercise of warrants, $2,980 from proceeds received from the sale of preferred stock and $403 from proceeds from advances from related parties.\nTo date we have financed our operations through sales of common stock and the issuance of debt.\nIn addition to these transactions, the Company in the period from April 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, entered into the following transactions:\n(a) On April 16, 2020, the Company received $386 in Payroll Protection Program funding related to Ecoark Holdings, and the Company also received on April 13, 2020, $1,482 in Payroll Protection Program funds for Pinnacle Frac LLC, a subsidiary of Banner Midstream. All but $29 has been forgiven as of December 31, 2020.\n(b) On May 1, 2020, an institutional investor elected to convert its remaining shares of Series B Preferred shares into 32 common shares.\n(c) On April 1 and May 5, 2020, two institutional investors elected to convert their 1 Series C Preferred share into 276 common shares.\n(d) On May 10, 2020, the Company received approximately $6,294 from accredited institutional investors holding 276 warrants issued on November 13, 2019 with an exercise price of $3.65 and holding 1,176 warrants with an exercise price of $4.50. The Company agreed to issue to these investors an additional number of warrants as a condition of their agreement to exercise the November 2019 warrants.\n(e) On December 31, 2020, the Company completed a registered direct offering, whereby the Company issued 889 shares of common stock and 889 accompanying warrants to purchase common stock to one institutional investor under the effective Form S-3 at $9.00 per share and accompanying warrant for a total of $8,000 in gross proceeds, before placement agent fees and other offering expenses. The warrants are exercisable for a two-year term at a strike price of $10.00 per share. The Company granted 62 warrants to the placement agent as compensation in addition to the $560 cash commission received by the placement agent The placement agent warrants are exercisable at $11.25 per share and expire on January 2, 2023.\nAt March 31, 2021 we had cash (including restricted cash) of $1,316, and $1,194 as of June 22, 2021. We had a working capital deficit of $11,845 and $16,689 as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in the working capital deficit is the result of the non-cash change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities offset by the repayment and conversion of debt and liabilities to shares of common stock. These liabilities were assumed in the Banner Midstream acquisition in March 2020. The Company believes it has adequate capital resources to meet its cash requirements during the next 12 months.\nThe Company raised approximately $16,119 in warrant exercises in the year ended March 31, 2021 as well as $8,001 in a registered direct offering. We expect that the revenue generating operations of Banner Midstream will continue to improve the liquidity of the Company moving forward. However, going forward, the effect of the pandemic on the capital markets may limit our ability to raise additional capital on the terms acceptable to us at the time we need it, if at all. As disclosed in the consolidated financial statements, COVID-19 has had an impact on our management\u2019s ability to operate effectively. The challenges related to remote work and travel restrictions that we as a smaller company have faced in striving to meet our disclosure obligations in a timely manner while taking the steps to protect the health and safety of our employees have impacted, and may continue to further impact, our ability to raise additional capital.\nThe Company pre-funded a majority of the cost, approximately $5,800, associated with the drilling and completion of an initial deep horizontal well in the Austin Chalk formation of which $3,387 was expensed as drilling costs as part of their Participation Agreement with Blackbrush Oil & Gas, L.P. The Company paid the amount of the drilling costs into a designated escrow account which occurred in January 2021.\nOn April 9, 2021, a Little Rock, Arkansas jury awarded Ecoark and Zest a total of $115 million in damages. See \u201cPart I. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d for further information. However, due to expected appeals, the Company does not expect to receive the proceeds until approximately 2025.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of March 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.",

    "item_1": "Item 1.Business\nOverview and Purpose\nGuidewire delivers a leading platform that Property and Casualty (\u201cP&C\u201d) insurers trust to engage, innovate, and grow efficiently. Guidewire\u2019s platform combines core operations, digital engagement, analytics, and artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) applications delivered as a cloud service or self-managed software. As a partner to our customers, we continually evolve to enable their success and assist them in navigating a rapidly changing insurance market.\nOur core operational services and products are InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud, InsuranceNow, and InsuranceSuite for self-managed installations. These services and products are transactional systems of record that support the entire insurance lifecycle, including insurance product definition, distribution, underwriting, policyholder services, and claims management. InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud is a highly configurable and scalable product, delivered as a service and primarily comprised of three core applications (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter) that can be subscribed to separately or together. These applications are built on and optimized for our Guidewire Cloud Platform (\u201cGWCP\u201d) architecture and leverage our in-house Guidewire Cloud operations team. InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud is designed to support multiple releases each year to ensure that cloud customers remain on the latest version and gain fast access to our innovation efforts. Additionally, InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud embeds digital and analytics capabilities natively into our platform. Most new sales and implementations are for InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud. InsuranceNow is a complete, cloud-based application that offers policy, billing, and claims management functionality to insurers that have limited internal information technology resources. InsuranceSuite for self-managed installations is comprised of three core applications (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter) that can be licensed separately or together and can be deployed and updated by our customers and their implementation partners. Our digital engagement applications enable digital sales, omni-channel service, and enhanced claims experiences for policyholders, agents, vendor partners, and field personnel. Our Analytics and AI offerings enable insurers to manage data more effectively, gain insights into their business, drive operational efficiencies, and underwrite new and evolving risks. To support P&C insurers globally, we have localized, and will continue to localize, our platform for use in a variety of international regulatory, language, and currency environments.\nOur customers range from some of the largest global insurance companies or their subsidiaries to predominantly national or local insurers that serve specific states and/or regions. Our customer engagement is led by our direct sales team and supported by our system integrator (\u201cSI\u201d) partners. We maintain and continue to grow our sales and marketing efforts globally, and maintain regional sales centers throughout the world.\nBecause our platform is critical to our new and existing customers\u2019 businesses, their decision-making and product evaluation process is long, which results in an extended sales cycle. These evaluation periods can extend further if a customer purchases multiple services and products or assesses the benefits of a cloud-based subscription. Sales to new customers also involve extensive customer due diligence and reference checks. The success of our sales efforts relies on continued improvements and enhancements to our current services and products, the introduction of new services and products, efficient operation of our cloud infrastructure, continued development of relevant local content and automated tools for updating content, and successful implementations.\nWe sell our cloud-delivered offerings through subscription services and our self-managed products through term licenses. We generally price our services and products based on the amount of direct written premium (\u201cDWP\u201d) that will be managed by our platform. Our subscription, term license, and support fees are typically invoiced annually in advance. Subscription services are generally sold with an initial term of between three and five years with optional annual renewals commencing after the initial term. Subscription revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the committed term, once all revenue recognition criteria is met including providing access to the service. Term licenses are primarily sold with an initial two-year committed term with optional annual renewals commencing after the initial term. We may enter into term license arrangements with our customers that have an initial term of more than two years or may renew license arrangements for longer than one year. A small portion of our revenue is derived from perpetual licenses. Term and perpetual license revenue are typically recognized when software is made available to a customer, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our support revenue is generally recognized ratably over the committed support term of the licensed software. Our support fees are typically priced as a fixed percentage of the associated license fees. We also offer professional services, both directly and through SI partners, to help our customers deploy, migrate, and utilize our services, products, and platform. Substantially all of our services revenue is billed monthly on a time and materials basis.\nWe began our principal business operations in 2001.\nIndustry Background\nThe P&C insurance industry is large, fragmented, highly regulated, and complex. It is also highly competitive, with insurers competing primarily on product differentiation, pricing options, customer service, marketing and advertising, affiliate programs, and channel strategies.\nP&C insurers modernize their transactional core systems to manage key functional areas of P&C insurance, including product definition, underwriting and policy administration, claims management, and billing. Product definition specifies the insurance coverage, pricing, and financial and legal terms of insurance policies. Underwriting and policy administration includes collecting information from potential policyholders, determining appropriate coverages and terms, pricing policies, issuing policies, and updating and maintaining policies over their lifetimes. Claims management includes loss intake, investigation and evaluation of incidents, settlement negotiation, vendor management, litigation management, and payment processing. Billing includes policyholder invoicing, payment collection, and agent commission calculation. We believe insurers that adopt modern core systems can enhance customer experience, operate more efficiently, and introduce innovative services and products more rapidly.\nWe believe the P&C insurance industry is experiencing accelerating change in how insurers engage with, sell to, and manage relationships with individual and business customers. Today, P&C insurers are striving to respond to significant changes in their competitive marketplace and the character of the risks they underwrite. The most significant changes include:\n\u2022an industry rapidly going through change that requires agility and efficiency from its core systems;\n\u2022a rise in customer expectations for digital, mobile, and omni-channel interaction rather than the traditional agent model;\n\u2022a need for 100% digital engagement capabilities;\n\u2022a growth in demand for personalized services and products;\n\u2022an increase in technology and market-driven changes in vehicular risk;\n\u2022demand for coverage of emerging risks such as terrorism, cybersecurity, pandemic, and reputational risk;\n\u2022a wealth of data and desire to harness data to improve and grow business;\n\u2022advances in the use of data and analytics to better market to and engage with customers, price policies, and manage claims;\n\u2022development of opportunities to compete or partner with non-traditional players that offer disruptive technology-based value propositions;\n\u2022established industry leaders are facing increased competition from new entrants in the market, including insurtech companies; and\n\u2022the introduction and leveraging of new technologies, such as drones, artificial intelligence, the \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d chatbots, and telematics.\nMany of these trends, such as digital engagement capabilities and data analytics, have increased in importance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to these trends, changes, challenges, and opportunities, we believe that the P&C insurance industry is entering a phase of increasing investment in technology, characterized by investments in systems that increase agility and enhance digital engagement and analytics offerings.\nWhile each insurer may have different goals and priorities when pursuing new technology investments, there are several major themes that we believe guide these investments:\n\u2022Digital Engagement Models. We believe that insurers will need to provide a more intuitive, digital user experience to reduce the risk of customer dissatisfaction and loss. Investment in digital user experience will allow insurers to deepen their engagement with customers and transition from passive and transactional customer interactions to active and advisory relationships. This transition will require investments in software services and products that are designed to model user journeys and enable more frequent, informed, and dynamic interactions between insurers and their customers. We believe these efforts can improve financial performance for insurers through increased lead conversions and lower customer churn.\n\u2022Cloud-Delivered Solutions. We believe that increased recognition of the compelling economic benefits of deploying software solutions on public infrastructure combined with increased confidence in the security and reliability of such platforms will cause more insurers to consider cloud-deployed solutions. Insurers benefit from an optimized division of labor and risk, allowing third parties to manage their infrastructure as they focus on competitively differentiating activities.\n\u2022Data Driven Decision-Making. Insurers are seeking to explore, visualize, and analyze proprietary and third-party data to optimize decision-making across the insurance lifecycle. We believe that such predictive analytical solutions are most effective when they provide predictive scores and other analytical insights to insurers\u2019 employees as they perform their underwriting and claims management activities. Insurers may also apply data and machine learning to automate certain tasks whenever possible, thereby enabling efficiencies, such as straight-through processing, that lessen the burden on subject matter experts.\n\u2022Innovation. Insurers are under pressure to innovate across their product lifecycle in order to grow their business and improve service quality. Examples of focus areas include creating services and products to target under-insured risks such as cyber, supply chain disruption, and reputational risk and partnering with insurtech providers to streamline operations and improve service to policyholders and agents.\n\u2022Legacy System Modernization. A significant portion of the market continues to rely on legacy systems. We believe new claims, policy management, and billing systems will continue to be adopted as insurers that rely on legacy systems seek to gain operating efficiencies, expand into new markets and lines of business, and introduce new digital and data offerings.\nProducts\nGuidewire is designed to be the platform insurers trust in order to engage, innovate, and grow efficiently. Our platform combines core operations, digital engagement, analytics, and AI applications, so that insurers can increase revenue, reduce operational costs and losses, improve pricing, and engage with a customer base that increasingly demands mobile and automated forms of self-service and communication. We are investing in research and development to accelerate improvements in our cloud platform services, products, and marketplace to better serve our customers.\nCore Operational Services and Products\nWe offer the following core operational services and products: Guidewire InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud, Guidewire InsuranceNow, and Guidewire InsuranceSuite for Self-Managed.\nGuidewire InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud\nGuidewire InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud is comprised of three primary applications (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter) optimized for our GWCP architecture.

The Guidewire Data Platform is a P&C insurance-specific data repository, built on GWCP, which collects data from internal and external sources to provide analytical insights across the insurance lifecycle for our customers. The Guidewire Data Platform powers all analytical applications. Additionally, we provide tools to automate routine tasks and make tasks self-service to increase our customers\u2019 agility while providing enterprise-grade performance, availability, privacy, and security. Given the specialized needs of the P&C insurance industry, we have developed a scalable cloud architecture that enables isolating each customer\u2019s system of record and database instances. This approach provides our customers with the benefits of cloud-native infrastructure and services and the flexibility to provide differentiated services to their customers.\nSubscriptions to cloud services include regular updates to Guidewire software to ensure that Guidewire Cloud customers can easily access our latest innovations. New capabilities are often toggled-off so that customers can activate them at the right time for their businesses.

Any such product introduction or modification must connect to and incorporate regulatory or industry-standard data and content, such as Insurance Services Office (\u201cISO\u201d) or National Council on Compensation Insurance (\u201cNCCI\u201d) content.\nGuidewire Underwriting Management\nGuidewire Underwriting Management is a cloud-based, integrated business application designed for commercial and specialty line insurers to drive premium growth and profit from better underwriting.

As consumers increasingly use self-service functions on the internet and on mobile devices, we believe that many of them prefer to interact with their insurance providers digitally and that they expect to have a consistent and efficient transactional experience through multiple channels, whether online, in-person or by phone. Our Digital Engagement Applications also benefit agents and brokers who are seeking to automate business processes with insurers\nto improve customer service and productivity.

We have increased the scope of our platform and business through internal development and acquisitions. This growing scope has required greater investment in the development of application interfaces and shared services necessary to unify the operations and user experience across our applications. To meet the anticipated increased demand for cloud-delivered solutions, we have increased investments to leverage the growing number of technology services provided by Amazon through AWS. The shift to cloud-delivered solutions has also required significant focus in improving our ability to manage, secure, and operate our applications since our cloud-based deployments, unlike our self-managed implementations, shift many operational responsibilities to us. Finally, we continue to improve the scalability of our service, which performs millions of complex, business-critical transactions daily. The accuracy and availability of our services must be maintained not only during normal business operations, but also during extraordinary events such as catastrophes, which may result in extremely high transaction volume in a short period of time.\nServices\nWe provide implementation, cloud migration, and integration services to help our customers realize the benefits of our cloud-based services and software products.

As of July 31, 2021, we had 1,860 employees in the United States and 1,082 employees internationally.\nAttracting, Developing, and Retaining Employees\nOur recruiting, development, and retention objectives focus on attracting skilled and engaged employees who contribute the talent and diverse perspectives critical to our innovative, forward-looking, and inclusive workforce. Our recruiting process actively sources diverse talent and is designed to reduce bias, supporting our ability to hire candidates with professional qualifications, personal potential, and differing perspectives. Our flexible work policies expand our ability to hire and retain talent in geographies where we do not have physical offices. Fostering career progression by encouraging regular professional education empowers our employees to pursue their professional goals, which is critical to developing and retaining our employees. We invest in broad-based development for all of our employees in various ways such as skills-building programs, on-demand learning options, mentoring programs, and leadership development courses. In an effort to create more development opportunities for all employees, we are currently expanding our intern, mentoring, and leadership development programs. We gauge progress and efficacy, identify opportunities for change, and pursue solutions through tracking and analyzing data from various sources such as annual talent reviews and our progress toward hiring/promotion goals in our development, diversity and inclusion plans.\nDiversity, Inclusion, and Belonging\nWe believe that understanding and respecting another\u2019s perspective, experience, background, and beliefs provides an opportunity to expand horizons, challenge complacency, and foster empathy. Diversity of perspective, experience, background, and beliefs fuel our innovative, collaborative, and engaged workplace. Realizing greater ethnic, racial, and gender diversity across all levels of our organization is, and will continue to be, an ongoing journey. We aim for the highest standards of fairness and equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, promotions, job assignments, and compensation. Some of our initiatives to create greater diversity and belonging among our employees include inclusive recruiting and outreach programs for diverse candidates, employee resource groups, and management-led listening circles.\nPositive Corporate Culture\nOur employees are critical to our success, and we believe creating a positive, inclusive culture is essential to attracting and retaining engaged employees. Our values of integrity, rationality, and collegiality are the foundation of how we work with one another. We incorporate a wide variety of communication and training activities to encourage collaboration amongst our colleagues around the world. We measure the program\u2019s efficacy and identify opportunities for improvements through an engagement survey distributed approximately every two years, with the last survey completed in April 2021.\nHealth and Wellness\nWe believe a healthy, engaged, and high-performing workforce is part of our competitive advantage. We want all of our employees to thrive, and we regularly re-evaluate how to best support our employees\u2019 wellness, health, and safety through benefits and resources. Our current benefit and wellness programs drive engagement that positively impacts our culture, job satisfaction, recruiting, and retention programs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded our physical, mental, and family health programs and informational outreach through professional development opportunities and personal empowerment, safe and healthy workspaces, wellness initiatives (including physical, emotional, and mental health), fair compensation, benefits, and recognition. Additionally, we have announced our intention to transition to a hybrid work environment in which a significant portion of our workforce will work either in-person on a part-time basis or remotely on a permanent basis.\nLabor Relations\nOur employees in the United States are not represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign locations, there are workers\u2019 councils that represent our employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. We recognize the critical role that our supervisors and managers play in fostering a productive, inclusive and respectful work environment, and we encourage employees to work directly with their supervisors, where possible, to efficiently and effectively resolve workplace concerns. We also respect our employees\u2019 rights to voluntarily establish and join unions and similar associations without unlawful interference. We strive to work collaboratively with the councils and associations that represent our workers.\nCustomers\nWe market and sell our services and products to a wide variety of global P&C insurers ranging from some of the largest global insurers to national and regional companies. We believe strong customer relationships are a key driver of our success given the long-term nature of our customer engagements and importance of customer references for new sales. We focus on developing and maintaining our customer relationships through customer service and account management. Customers are defined as entities that have placed orders for our services or products. In some instances, a parent corporation can have multiple entities, or insurance brands, that place orders for our services or products. As of July 31, 2021, we had more than 350 customers representing more than 450 insurance brands, also referred to as insurers, using one or more of our services or products in 34 countries.\nStrategic Relationships\nWe have extensive relationships with SI, consulting, technology, and industry partners. Our network of partners has expanded as interest in and adoption of our platform has grown. We encourage our partners to co-market, pursue joint sales initiatives, and drive broader adoption of our technology, helping us grow our business more efficiently and enabling us to focus our resources on continued innovation and further enhancement of our solutions.\nWe work closely with our network of third-party SI partners to facilitate new sales and implementations of both our subscription services and self-managed products. Our partnerships with leading SI partners allow us to increase efficiency and scale while reducing customer implementation costs. We continue to invest time and resources to increase the number of qualified consultants employed by our SI partners, develop relationships with new partners in existing and new markets, and ensure that all SI partners are qualified to assist with implementing our services and products. We believe this model will continue to serve us well, and we intend to continue to expand our network of partners and the number of certified consultants with whom we work so we can leverage our SI partners more effectively, especially for future subscription implementations.\nAs part of our PartnerConnect alliance program, we have a community of Solution Partners developing integrations that enable software and insurance business solutions to interoperate with our services and products. As of July 31, 2021, more than 190 of these partner-developed integrations have been validated by us and awarded Ready for Guidewire branding. The Guidewire Marketplace provides our customers with an online forum to learn about and download Ready for Guidewire integrations for use with our services and products. These integrations help customers reduce implementation risk and effort, and lower the total cost of implementation and operation. The Guidewire Marketplace also empowers customers pursuing innovation initiatives by providing access to a curated collection of insurtech applications. We anticipate expanding the reach of the Guidewire Marketplace.\nSales and Marketing\nConsistent with our industry focus and the mission-critical needs our services and products address, our sales and marketing efforts are tailored to communicate effectively to senior executives within the P&C insurance industry. Our sales, marketing, and executive teams work together to cultivate long-term relationships with current and prospective customers in each of the geographies in which we are active.\nOur direct sales team serves as both our exclusive sales channel and our account management function and is organized by geographic region across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. We augment our sales professionals with a pre-sales team possessing insurance domain and technical expertise, who engage customers to understand their specific business needs and then represent our services and products through demonstrations tailored to address those needs.\nOur marketing team supports sales with competitive analysis and sales tools, while investing to strengthen our brand name and reputation. We participate at industry conferences, are published frequently in the industry press, and have active relationships with all of the major industry analysts. We also host Connections, our annual user conference where customers both participate in and deliver in-person and virtual presentations on a wide range of Guidewire and insurance technology topics. We invite potential customers and partners to our user conference, as we believe customer references are a key component of driving new sales. Our strong relationships with leading system integrators enhance our direct sales through co-marketing efforts and by providing additional market validation of the distinctiveness and quality of our offerings.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development efforts focus on enhancing our platform, services, and products to meet the complex requirements of P&C insurers with a focus on capabilities, operational efficiency, data analytics, security, and privacy in the cloud. These efforts are intended to help our customers improve their operations; drive greater digital engagement with their customers, agents, and brokers; and gather, store and analyze data to improve business decisions. We also invest significantly in developing our services and products and necessary integrations to meet the market requirements, including regulations, language, currency, and local terminology, of each country or state in which our customers operate. This market-segment specific functionality must be updated regularly in order to stay current with regulatory changes in each market. We rely on a multi-national engineering team, which has grown organically and through acquisitions.\nCompetition\nThe software market that caters to the P&C insurance industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Increased spending by insurers on software solutions and the emergence of new platforms that have broadened from core system modernization to new digital engagement and data and analytics solutions have generated significant interest among investors and entrepreneurs. Increased capital allows market participants, or potential market participants such as insurtech companies, to adopt more aggressive go-to-market strategies, improve existing services or products, introduce new services or products, develop innovative solutions that disrupt the market, and consolidate with other vendors. This market is also subject to changing technology preferences, shifting customer needs, and the adoption of cloud deployed solutions. These factors create an environment of increasing competition. Our current and future competitors vary in size and in the breadth and scope of the services or products they offer. As we expand our product portfolio, we may begin to compete with software and service providers we have not traditionally competed against. Our current competitors include, but are not limited to, customers\u2019 internally developed proprietary solutions; P&C insurance software vendors such as Duck Creek, EIS Group, Insurity, Majesco, Prima Solutions, RGI, and Sapiens; and horizontal software vendors such as SAP and Salesforce, which acquired Vlocity in 2020.\nCompetitive factors in our industry depend on the product being offered and the size, geographic market, and line of business of potential customers. The principal competitive factors include product functionality, performance, customer references, total cost of ownership, solution completeness, implementation track record, security and in-depth knowledge of the P&C insurance industry. We typically compete favorably on the basis of these factors in most geographies.\nIntellectual Property\nThe software industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Our success and ability to compete depend in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology, to establish and adequately protect our intellectual property rights, and to protect against third-party claims and litigation related to intellectual property. To accomplish these objectives, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual protections. We own or have pending patents and patent applications, which generally apply to our software. Our owned patents have expiration dates starting in 2025. We also rely on several registered and unregistered trademarks, as well as pending applications for such registrations, in order to protect our brand both in the United States and internationally.\nOur investments in services and partners are designed to ensure customer success by committing additional resources to both cloud-based and self-managed implementation projects. Our investments in cloud operations are focused on managing the infrastructure for our cloud-based customers in a secure, efficient, and cost-effective manner.\nInformation about Segment and Geographic Revenue\nInformation about geographic revenue is set forth in Note 2 and information about segment reporting is set forth in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSeasonality\nWe have experienced seasonal variations in our license revenue and, to a lesser extent, in our subscription revenue as a result of increased customer orders in our fourth fiscal quarter. We generally see significantly increased orders in our fourth fiscal quarter, which is the quarter ending July 31, due to efforts by our sales team to achieve annual incentives. Because we recognize revenue upfront for new term licenses and multi-year renewals compared to over time for subscription services, changes in the mix between term license and subscription services may impact our quarterly results. Additionally, any quarter in which a significant multi-year term license or multi-year term license renewal or non-renewal occurs could be impacted. For\nexample, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we experienced license revenue growth due to a five-year term license renewal under which revenue was recognized upfront, which overshadowed the comparison with our second fiscal quarter of 2021 and may create a challenging comparable period for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Additionally, as subscriptions increase as a percentage of total sales, the revenue we can recognize in the initial fiscal year of an order will be reduced, deferred revenue will increase, and our reported revenue growth will be adversely affected in the near term due to the ratable nature of these arrangements. The concentration of our sales in our fiscal fourth quarter increases this impact as the revenue impact of most fiscal fourth quarter subscription sales will not be realized until the following fiscal year.\nOur services revenue is also subject to seasonal fluctuations, though to a lesser degree than our license revenue and subscription revenue. Our services revenue is impacted by the number of billable days in a given fiscal quarter. The fiscal quarter ending January 31 usually has fewer billable days due to the impact of the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year\u2019s holidays. The fiscal quarter ending July 31 usually has fewer billable days due to the impact of vacations taken by our services professionals. Because we pay our services professionals the same amount throughout the year, our gross margins on our services revenue are usually lower in these quarters. This seasonal pattern, however, may be absent in any given year.\nWHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION\nThe following filings are available to view and download free of charge on our investor relations website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with the SEC: Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and our Proxy Statement for our annual meeting of stockholders.

All information presented herein is based on our fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to particular years or quarters refer to our fiscal years ended in July and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nWe have elected to omit discussion on the earliest of the three years covered by the consolidated financial statements presented. Refer to Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, filed on September 28, 2020, for reference to discussion of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, the earliest of the three fiscal years presented.\nOverview\nGuidewire delivers a leading platform that P&C insurers trust to engage, innovate, and grow efficiently. Guidewire\u2019s platform combines core operations, digital engagement, analytics, and AI applications delivered as a cloud service or self-managed software. As a partner to our customers, we continually evolve to enable their success and assist them in navigating a rapidly changing insurance market.\nOur core operational services and products are InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud, InsuranceNow, and InsuranceSuite for self-managed installations. These services and products are transactional systems of record that support the entire insurance lifecycle, including insurance product definition, distribution, underwriting, policyholder services, and claims management. InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud is a highly configurable and scalable product, delivered as a service and primarily comprised of three core applications (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter) that can be subscribed to separately or together. These applications are built on and optimized for our Guidewire Cloud Platform (\u201cGWCP\u201d) architecture and leverage our in-house Guidewire Cloud operations team. InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud is designed to support multiple releases each year to ensure that cloud customers remain on the latest version and gain fast access to our innovation efforts. Additionally, InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud embeds digital and analytics capabilities natively into our platform. Most new sales and implementations are for InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud. InsuranceNow is a complete, cloud-based application that offers policy, billing, and claims management functionality to insurers that have limited internal information technology resources. InsuranceSuite for self-managed installations is comprised of three core applications (PolicyCenter, BillingCenter, and ClaimCenter) that can be licensed separately or together and can be deployed and updated by our customers and their implementation partners. Our digital engagement applications enable digital sales, omni-channel service, and enhanced claims experiences for policyholders, agents, vendor partners, and field personnel. Our Analytics and AI offerings enable insurers to manage data more effectively, gain insights into their business, drive operational efficiencies, and underwrite new and evolving risks. To support P&C insurers globally, we have localized, and will continue to localize, our platform for use in a variety of international regulatory, language, and currency environments.\nOur customers range from some of the largest global insurance companies or their subsidiaries to predominantly national or local insurers that serve specific states and/or regions. Our customer engagement is led by our direct sales team and supported by our SI partners. We maintain and continue to grow our sales and marketing efforts globally, and maintain regional sales centers throughout the world.\nBecause our platform is critical to our new and existing customers\u2019 businesses, their decision-making and product evaluation process is long, which results in an extended sales cycle. These evaluation periods can extend further if a customer purchases multiple services and products or assesses the benefits of a cloud-based subscription. Sales to new customers also involve extensive customer due diligence and reference checks. Our sales cycle has lengthened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The success of our sales efforts relies on continued improvements and enhancements to our current services and products, the introduction of new services and products, efficient operation of our cloud infrastructure, continued development of relevant local content and automated tools for updating content, and successful implementations.\nWe sell our cloud-delivered offerings through subscription services and our self-managed products through term licenses. We generally price our services and products based on the amount of DWP that will be managed by our platform. Our subscription, term license, and support fees are typically invoiced annually in advance. Subscription services are generally sold with an initial term of between three and five years with optional annual renewals commencing after the initial term.\nSubscription revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the committed term, once all revenue recognition criteria is met including providing access to the service. Term licenses are primarily sold with an initial two-year committed term with optional annual renewals commencing after the initial term. We may enter into term license arrangements with our customers that have an initial term of more than two years or may renew license arrangements for longer than one year. A small portion of our revenue is derived from perpetual licenses. Term and perpetual license revenue are typically recognized when software is made available to a customer, provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our support revenue is generally recognized ratably over the committed support term of the licensed software. Our support fees are typically priced as a fixed percentage of the associated license fees. We also offer professional services, both directly and through SI partners, to help our customers deploy, migrate, and utilize our platform, services, and products. Substantially all of our services revenue is billed monthly on a time and materials basis.\nOver the past few years, we have primarily been entering into cloud-based subscription arrangements with our new and existing customers, and we anticipate that subscription arrangements will be a majority of annual new sales going forward. As this sales model matures, we may decide to change certain contract terms in new arrangements to remain competitive or otherwise meet market demands.\nTo extend our technology leadership in the global market and to drive operating efficiency, we continue to invest in product development and cloud operations to enhance and improve our current services and products, introduce new services and products, and advance our ability to cost-effectively deliver our services in the cloud. Continued investment is critical as we seek to assist our customers in achieving their technology goals, maintain our competitive advantage, grow our revenue, expand internationally, and meet evolving customer demands. In certain cases, we may also acquire skills and technologies to manage our cloud infrastructure and accelerate our time to market for new services, products, solutions, and upgrades.\nOur track record of success with customers and their implementations is central to maintaining our strong competitive position. We rely on our global services team and SI partners to ensure that teams with the right combination of product and language skills are used in the most efficient way to meet our customers\u2019 implementation needs. We have extensive relationships with SI, consulting, technology, and industry partners. Our network of partners has expanded as interest in and adoption of our platform has grown. We encourage our partners to co-market, pursue joint sales initiatives, and drive broader adoption of our technology, helping us grow our business more efficiently and enabling us to focus our resources on continued innovation and further enhancement of our solutions.\nWe work closely with our network of third-party SI partners to facilitate new sales and implementations of both our subscription services and self-managed products. Our partnerships with leading SI partners allow us to increase efficiency and scale while reducing customer implementation costs. We continue to invest time and resources to increase the number of qualified consultants employed by our SI partners, develop relationships with new partners in existing and new markets, and ensure that all SI partners are qualified to assist with implementing our services and products. We believe this model will continue to serve us well, and we intend to continue to expand our network of partners and the number of certified consultants with whom we work so we can leverage our SI partners more effectively, especially for future subscription migrations and implementations.\nWe face a number of risks in the execution of our strategy, including risks related to expanding to new markets, managing lengthy sales cycles, competing effectively in the global market, relying on sales to a relatively small number of large customers, developing new or acquiring existing services and products successfully, migrating our business towards a subscription model with ratable revenue recognition, increasing the overall adoption of our services and products, and cost-effectively managing the infrastructure of our cloud-based customers. In response to these and other risks we might face, we continue to invest in many areas of our business, including product development, cloud operations, implementation services and sales and marketing.\nCOVID-19 Impact\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, which has continued to spread throughout the United States and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. While we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, containment measures, and if there are periods of increases in the number of COVID-19 cases or future variants of the virus in areas in which we operate, our compliance with containment measures has impacted our day-to-day operations and could continue to disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of our key customers, SI partners, vendors, and other counterparties, for an indefinite period of time. To support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, SI partners and communities, a vast majority of our employees are working remotely. In addition, many of our existing and potential\ncustomers are working remotely, which may continue to delay the timing of new orders and professional services engagements in the future.\nOur business and financial results since the third fiscal quarter of 2020 have been impacted due to these disruptions, including decreases in ARR growth rates, services revenue and margins, operating cash flow and the change in fair value of strategic investments. ARR and revenue, especially services revenue, continued to be impacted in fiscal year 2021 as a result of the challenges related to our compliance with government-mandated or recommended shelter-in-place orders in jurisdictions in which we, our customers, SI partners and vendors operate.\nAlthough vaccines are making progress against the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and certain other parts of the world where vaccinations are widely available, the economic impact of the pandemic on our business and the businesses of our customers, SI partners, and vendors may continue into fiscal year 2022, if not longer. We believe that new sales activities are being delayed, not cancelled, and implementation engagements are being rescheduled to later periods or being completed over a longer period of time. Certain marketing events have or will be cancelled or postponed, while the majority are being hosted virtually, like our customer conference, Connections. Our customers may be unable to pay or may request amended payment terms for their outstanding invoices due to the economic impacts from COVID-19, and we may need to increase our accounts receivable allowances. A decrease in orders in a given period could negatively affect our revenues and ARR in future periods, particularly if experienced on a sustained basis, because a substantial proportion of our new software subscription services orders is recognized as revenue over time. Also, the pandemic\u2019s global economic impact could affect our customers\u2019 DWP, which could ultimately impact our revenue as we generally price our services and products based on the amount of DWP that will be managed by our platform. Additionally, we may be required to record impairment related to our operating lease assets, investments, long-lived assets, or goodwill.\nIn response to the pandemic, various government programs have been announced which provide financial relief to affected businesses. As an example, the Canadian Government enacted the Canada emergency Wage Subsidy (\u201cCEWS\u201d) under their COVID-19 Economic Response Plan to prevent layoffs and help employers offset, for a limited time, a portion of their employee salaries and wages. Beginning in January 2021, we have applied for the CEWS, to the extent we met the requirements to receive a subsidy, and recorded a reduction of compensation expense of approximately $3 million that is reflected in cost of revenue and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during fiscal year 2021. We will continue to review and apply for additional subsidies or relief, where applicable.\nWe will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe use certain key metrics and financial measures not prepared in accordance with GAAP to evaluate and manage our business, including ARR and Free Cash Flow. For a further discussion of how we use key metrics and certain non-GAAP financial measures, see \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nAnnual Recurring Revenue (\u201cARR\u201d)\nWe use ARR to quantify the annualized recurring value outlined in active customer contracts at the end of a reporting period. ARR includes the annualized recurring value of term licenses, subscription agreements, support contracts, and hosting agreements based on customer contracts, which may not be the same as the timing and amount of revenue recognized. All components of the licensing and other arrangements that are not expected to recur (primarily perpetual licenses and professional services) are excluded. In some arrangements with multiple performance obligations, a portion of recurring license and support or subscription contract value is allocated to services revenue for revenue recognition purposes, but does not get allocated for purposes of calculating ARR. This revenue allocation only impacts the initial term of the contract. This means that as we increase arrangements with multiple performance obligations that include services at discounted rates, more of the total contract value will be recognized as services revenue, but our reported ARR amount will not be impacted. In fiscal year 2021, the recurring license and support or subscription contract value recognized as services revenue was $5.5 million.\nIf a customer contract contains invoicing amounts that increase over the contract term, then ARR reflects the annualized invoicing amount outlined in the contract for the current reporting period. For example, given a contract with annual invoicing of $1.0 million at the beginning of year one, $2.0 million at the beginning of year two, and $3.0 million at the beginning of year three, and the reporting period is subsequent to year two invoicing and prior to year three invoicing, the reported ARR for that contract would be $2.0 million.\nAs of July 31, 2021, ARR was $582 million, or $575 million based on currency exchange rates as of July 31, 2020. We measure ARR on a constant currency basis during the fiscal year and revalue ARR at year end to current currency rates. ARR grew in fiscal year 2021 by 13%, or 12% on a constant currency basis.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe monitor our free cash flow, as a key measure of our overall business performance, which enables us to analyze our financial performance without the effects of certain non-cash items such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation expenses. Additionally, free cash flow takes into account the impact of changes in deferred revenue, which reflects the receipt of cash payment for services and products before they are recognized as revenue, and unbilled accounts receivable, which reflects revenue that has been recognized that has yet to be invoiced to our customers. Our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities is significantly impacted by the timing of invoicing and collections of accounts receivable, the timing and amount of annual bonus payments, as well as payroll and tax payments. Our capital expenditures consist of purchases of property and equipment, primarily computer hardware, software, leasehold improvements, and capitalized software development costs. In the third fiscal quarter of 2020, free cash flow was impacted by a $9.9 million partial early bonus payout, which correspondingly resulted in lower bonus payments in the first fiscal quarter of 2021. This partial early bonus payout was approved by our board of directors in order to support our employees and, in turn, their local economies during the extraordinary situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first fiscal quarter of 2022, we will pay the entire bonus amount for fiscal year 2021 along with accrued vacation for U.S. employees, as we have announced a move to an unlimited vacation policy. The build out and furnishing of our corporate headquarters in San Mateo, California impacted free cash flow by $11.1 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. The build out and furnishing of our new offices in Mississauga, Canada and Dublin, Ireland impacted free cash flow by a total of $15.6 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. For a further discussion of our operating cash flows, see \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows.\u201d\nFiscal years ended July 31,\n2021 2020\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 111,587 $ 113,066\nPurchases of property and equipment (19,008) (21,377)\nCapitalized software development costs (9,846) (4,283)\nFree cash flow $ 82,733 $ 87,406\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accounting policies, methods, and estimates are an integral part of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and, in part, are based upon management\u2019s current judgments. Those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting policies, methods, and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management\u2019s current judgments. While there are a number of significant accounting policies, methods, and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements, which are described in Note 1 \u201cThe Company and a Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenue recognition policies are critical to the periods presented.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue recognition requires judgment and the use of estimates, especially in identifying and evaluating the various non-standard terms and conditions in our contracts with customers as to their effect on reported revenue.\nOur revenue is derived from contracts with customers. The majority of our revenue is derived from subscriptions to our cloud services, licensing arrangements for our software, and implementation and other professional services arrangements. We account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d). The core principle of ASC 606 is to recognize revenue upon the transfer of services or products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services or products. We apply a five-step framework to recognize revenue as described in our Revenue Recognition policy included in Note 1 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur customers have significant negotiating power during the sales process, which can and does result in terms and conditions that are different from our standard terms and conditions. When terms and conditions of our customer contracts are not standard, certain negotiated terms may require significant judgment in order to determine the appropriate revenue recognition in accordance with ASC 606.\nThe estimates and assumptions requiring significant judgment under our revenue policy in accordance with ASC 606 are as follows:\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nIf the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) in relation to the total fair value of all performance obligations in the arrangement. Some of our performance obligations, such as support, implementation services, and training services, have observable inputs that are used to determine the SSP of those distinct performance obligations. Where SSP is not directly observable, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. In the circumstances when available information to determine SSP is highly variable or uncertain, such as for our term licenses, we will use the residual method.\nThe majority of our contracts contain multiple performance obligations, such as when licenses are sold with support, implementation services or training services. As customers enter into a subscription agreement to migrate from an existing term license agreement, customers may be under contract for self-managed licenses and support, in addition to subscription services, for a period of time, which may require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation. Additionally, contract modifications for services and products that are distinct but are not priced commensurate with their SSP or are not distinct from the existing contract may affect the initial transaction price or the allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. In such cases, revenue recognized may be adjusted.\nChanges from Prior Periodic Reports\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have revised our disclosures to comply with SEC Release No. 33-10825, \u201cModernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105.\u201d In addition, we have early adopted the changes in the disclosure standards included in SEC Release No. 33-10890, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, Supplementary Financial Information.\u201d\nModernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105\nThe SEC issued Release No. 33-10825, \u201cModernization of Regulation S-K Items 101, 103, and 105,\u201d effective for annual periods beginning subsequent to November 2020. This release was adopted to modernize the description of business, legal proceedings, and risk factor disclosures that registrants are required to make pursuant to Regulation S-K. Specifically, this release requires registrants to provide disclosures relating to their human capital resources and to restructure their risk factor disclosures. Additionally, the release increases the threshold for disclosure of environmental proceedings to which the government is a party.\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Information\nThe SEC issued Release No. 33-10890 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, Supplementary Financial Information\u201d which became fully effective on August 9, 2021. This release was adopted to modernize, simplify, and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-K. Specifically, the SEC eliminated the requirement for selected financial data, only requiring quarterly disclosure when there are retrospective changes affecting comprehensive income, and amending the matters required to be presented under Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) to, among other things, eliminate the requirement of the contractual obligations table.\nWith our adoption of this release, we have eliminated from this document the items discussed above that are no longer required. Information on our contractual obligations is still disclosed in narrative form within the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 \u201cThe Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements adopted, including the dates of adoption, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our results of operations for the years presented. The data has been derived from the consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K which, in the opinion of our management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly present the financial position and results of operations for the fiscal years presented. The operating results for any period should not be considered indicative of results for any future period.\nFiscal years ended July 31,\n2021 As a % of Total Revenue 2020 As a % of Total Revenue\n(in thousands except percentages)\nRevenue:\nSubscription and support $ 252,358 34 % $ 203,473 27 %\nLicense 303,792 41 331,554 45\nServices 187,117 25 207,280 28\nTotal revenue 743,267 100 742,307 100\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription and support 164,983 22 117,158 16\nLicense 10,569 1 11,566 2\nServices 199,502 27 209,291 28\nTotal cost of revenue 375,054 50 338,015 46\nGross profit:\nSubscription and support 87,375 12 86,315 11\nLicense 293,223 39 319,988 43\nServices (12,385) (2) (2,011) -\nTotal gross profit 368,213 49 404,292 54\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 219,494 30 200,575 27\nSales and marketing 160,544 22 142,420 19\nGeneral and administrative 93,759 13 85,183 11\nTotal operating expenses 473,797 65 428,178 57\nIncome (loss) from operations (105,584) (16) (23,886) (3)\nInterest income 7,395 1 24,705 3\nInterest expense (18,711) (3) (17,945) (2)\nOther income (expense), net 12,619 2 (7,205) (1)\nIncome (loss) before provision for (benefit from) income taxes (104,281) (16) (24,331) (3)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes (37,774) (7) 2,867 -\nNet income (loss) $ (66,507) (9) % $ (27,198) (3) %\nComparison of the Fiscal Years Ended July 31, 2021 and 2020\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue primarily from delivering cloud-based services, licensing our software applications, providing support, and delivering professional services.\nSubscription and Support\nA growing portion of our revenue consists of fees for our subscription services, which are generally priced based on the amount of DWP that is managed by our subscription services. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, beginning at the point in time our provisioning process has been completed and access has been made available to the customer. The initial term of such arrangements is generally from three to five years. Subscription agreements contain optional annual renewals commencing upon the expiration of the initial contract term. A majority of our subscription customers are billed annually in advance. In some arrangements with multiple performance obligations, a portion of recurring subscription contract value may be allocated to license revenue or services revenue for revenue recognition purposes. For example, in arrangements with multiple performance obligations that include services at discounted rates, a portion of the total contract value related to subscription services will be allocated and recognized as services revenue.\nOur support revenue is generally recognized ratably over the committed support term of the licensed software. Our support fees are typically priced as a fixed percentage of the associated term license fees. We generally invoice support annually in advance.\nLicense\nA substantial majority of our license revenue consists of term license fees. Our term license revenue is primarily generated through license fees that are billed annually in advance during the term of the contract, including any renewals. Our term license fees are generally priced based on the amount of DWP that will be managed by our licensed software. Our term licenses have generally been sold under a two-year initial term with optional annual renewals after the initial term. However, we do enter into license arrangements that have an initial term of more than two years and renewal terms of more than one year. Term license revenue for the committed term of the customer agreement is generally fully recognized upon delivery of the software or at the beginning of the renewal term.\nIn a limited number of cases, we license our software on a perpetual basis. Perpetual license revenue is generally recognized upon delivery. We invoice our perpetual license customers either in full at contract signing or on an installment basis.\nServices\nOur services revenue is primarily derived from implementation services performed for our customers, reimbursable travel expenses, and training fees. A substantial majority of our services engagements are billed and recognized on a time and materials basis upon providing our services.\nFiscal years ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change\n% of total % of total\nAmount revenue Amount revenue ($) (%)\n(in thousands, except percentages)\nRevenue:\nSubscription and support:\nSubscription $ 168,649 23 % $ 119,658 16 % $ 48,991 41 %\nSupport 83,709 11 83,815 11 (106) -\nLicense:\nTerm license 303,309 41 328,489 44 (25,180) (8)\nPerpetual license 483 - 3,065 1 (2,582) (84)\nServices 187,117 25 207,280 28 (20,163) (10)\nTotal revenue $ 743,267 100 % $ 742,307 100 % $ 960 - %\nSubscription and Support\nWe anticipate subscriptions will continue to represent a majority of new arrangements, including customers migrating from existing term license arrangements to subscription services, in future periods. Due to the ratable recognition of subscription revenue, growth in subscription revenue will lag behind the growth of subscription orders and will impact the comparative growth of our reported revenue. If we complete a higher percentage of subscription arrangements in a given period, our short-term growth rates will be negatively impacted. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, the impact of new subscription orders in the fourth fiscal quarter, our historically largest quarter for new orders, is not reflected in revenues until the following fiscal year.\nSubscription revenue increased by $49.0 million, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the impact of new subscription services agreements for InsuranceSuite via Guidewire Cloud entered into and provisioned since July 31, 2020.\nLicense support revenue was flat, compared to the prior year. Support related to subscription arrangements is included in subscription revenue, as support is not quoted or priced separately from the subscription services. As customers enter into a subscription agreement to migrate from an existing term license agreement, the timing and amount of revenue recognized will be impacted by allocations of the total contract value between the license, subscription, and support performance obligations. As a result, we expect the increase in subscription orders as a percentage of total new sales and customers migrating from term licenses to subscription services will continue to reduce the growth in, or result in lower, support revenue in the future.\nLicense\nRevenue related to new term licenses and multi-year term license renewals is generally recognized upfront and, as a result, no additional license revenue is recognized until after the committed term expires. As a customer enters into a subscription agreement to migrate from an existing term license agreement, the timing and amount of revenue recognition will be impacted by allocations of total contract value between license, subscription, and support performance obligations. License revenue growth has and will be negatively impacted as subscription sales increase as a percentage of total new sales and as customers migrate from term licenses to subscription services instead of renewing their term licenses.\nTerm license revenue decreased by $25.2 million, compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower revenue from new term licenses of $12.4 million and term license renewals of $12.3 million. Included in these amounts is the impact of term license contracts with an initial term of greater than two years or a renewal term of greater than one year. The impact on term license revenue from contracts that deviated from our standard contract durations was $23.4 million in fiscal year 2021 compared with $37.6 million in the prior year.\nPerpetual license revenue decreased by $2.6 million, compared to the prior year, and accounted for less than 1% of total revenue in fiscal year 2021. We expect perpetual license revenue to continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenue. Perpetual license revenue may potentially be volatile across periods due to the large amount of perpetual revenue that may be generated from a single customer order.\nServices Revenue\nServices revenue decreased $20.2 million, compared to the prior year. The decrease is primarily driven by contracts with lower average services billing rates and increased investments in customer implementations to accelerate their transition to the cloud, and to a lesser extent a $6.8 million reduction in revenue from billable travel costs due to travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic during fiscal year 2021.\nWe expect modestly higher levels of variability in our services revenue in future periods. As we successfully leverage our SI partners to lead more implementations, our services revenue could decrease further. We expect challenges related to COVID-19 will also continue to negatively impact services revenue. As we continue to expand into new markets and develop new services and products, we have, and may continue to, enter into contracts with lower average billing rates, make investments in customer implementation and migration engagements, and enter into fixed price contracts, which may impact services revenue and services margins.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nOur cost of subscription and support revenue consists of personnel costs for our cloud operations and technical support teams, cloud infrastructure costs, development of online training curriculum, amortization of our intangible assets, and royalty fees paid to third parties. Our cost of license revenue primarily consists of development of online training curriculum, royalty fees paid to third parties, and amortization of our intangible assets. Our cost of services revenue primarily consists of personnel costs for our professional service employees, third-party contractors, and travel-related costs. In instances where we have primary responsibility for the delivery of services, subcontractor fees are expensed as cost of services revenue. In each case, personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation.\nWe allocate overhead such as information technology support, information security, facilities, and other administrative costs to all functional departments based on headcount. As such, these general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each functional operating expense.\nCost of Revenue:\nFiscal years ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change\nAmount % of total revenue Amount % of total revenue ($) (%)\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription and support $ 164,983 22 % $ 117,158 16 % $ 47,825 41 %\nLicense 10,569 1 11,566 2 (997) (9)\nServices 199,502 27 209,291 28 (9,789) (5)\nTotal cost of revenue $ 375,054 50 % $ 338,015 46 % $ 37,039 11 %\nIncludes stock-based compensation of:\nCost of subscription and support revenue $ 11,231 $ 7,575 $ 3,656\nCost of license revenue 770 769 1\nCost of services revenue 21,809 20,816 993\nTotal $ 33,810 $ 29,160 $ 4,650\nCost of subscription and support revenue increased by $47.8 million primarily due to increases of $33.1 million in personnel costs due to our continued investment in our cloud operations to increase operational efficiency and scale and $16.3 million in cloud infrastructure costs for our growing cloud customer base. The increase in personnel costs is net of a $1.6 million benefit related to CEWS received in fiscal year 2021.\nDue to our growth in cloud operations, new cloud-based customers, and increased usage from existing cloud-based customers, the costs to provide our subscription services increased. We expect our cost of subscription revenue to increase as we continue to invest in our cloud operations and incur higher cloud infrastructure costs to support our growing cloud customer base, to improve efficiencies, and to continuously improve and maintain secure environments. However, we believe that the cost of subscription revenue will grow at a slower rate than subscription revenue in future years as we achieve economies of scale and other efficiencies. Cost of support revenue is expected to remain flat or slightly decrease over time as term license customers transition to the cloud. The short-term impact of these trends along with mix within subscription and support revenue may result in a decline in subscription and support gross margin even though subscription and support gross profit increases in absolute dollars.\nThe $1.0 million decrease in our cost of license revenue was primarily attributable to decreases in amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.3 million, partially offset by costs associated with the development of online training curriculum included with the latest releases of InsuranceSuite. We continue to anticipate lower cost of license revenue over time as our term license customers transition to cloud subscription agreements.\nThe $9.8 million decrease in cost of services revenue was primarily attributable to decreases of $8.2 million in billable subcontractor expenses, $7.4 million in employee and third party consultant travel-related costs resulting from COVID-19 travel restrictions, and $1.0 million in professional services, general office and software costs, partially offset by an increase of $6.9 million in personnel-related costs mainly due to higher bonus attainment based on company performance. The increase in personnel-related costs is net of a $0.4 million benefit related to the CEWS received in fiscal year 2021.\nWe had 600 cloud operations and technical support employees and 657 professional service employees at July 31, 2021 compared to 378 cloud operations and technical support employees and 758 professional services employees at July 31, 2020. In fiscal year 2020, certain professional services employees supported our cloud operations and research and development activities, and the related personnel costs were reflected within cost of subscription revenue and research and development expense. Since July 31, 2020, approximately 115 employees have been transferred from professional services to cloud operations and research and development to support the growth in our cloud customers.\nGross Profit\nFiscal years ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change\nAmount margin % Amount margin % ($) (%)\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nGross profit:\nSubscription and support $ 87,375 35 % $ 86,315 42 % $ 1,060 1 %\nLicense 293,223 97 319,988 97 (26,765) (8)\nServices (12,385) (7) (2,011) (1) (10,374) 516\nTotal gross profit $ 368,213 50 % $ 404,292 54 % $ (36,079) (9) %\nOur gross profit decreased $36.1 million compared to the prior year. Gross profit was impacted by the decrease in term license revenue due to lower impact of multi-year term license arrangements entered into in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 and decreases in professional services revenue driven by contracts with lower average services billing rates and increased investment in implementation engagements.\nOur gross margin decreased to 50% in fiscal year 2021, as compared to 54% in fiscal year 2020. Gross margin was impacted by lower subscription and support gross margins resulting from increasing investments in cloud operations and lower services gross margin resulting from contracts with lower average services billing rates and investments in implementation engagements.\nWe expect subscription and support gross margins will fluctuate as our subscription revenue increases and we continue to invest in our cloud operations. However, as we gain efficiencies and increase the number of cloud customers, we expect subscription gross margins to improve over time. In addition to the impact of our investment in customer migrations and implementations, challenges related to COVID-19 may negatively impact services gross margin beyond this fiscal year. We expect license gross margin will fluctuate based on changes in revenue due to the timing of delivery of new multi-year term licenses and the execution of multi-year term license renewals, as cost of license revenue is expected to be relatively consistent with prior years in the future. Overall, we expect gross margins to decline in the short-term primarily due to the mix between license revenue and subscription and support revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. The largest components of our operating expenses are personnel costs for our employees and, to a lesser extent, professional services. In each case, personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, commissions, benefits, and stock-based compensation. We allocate overhead such as information technology support, information security, facilities, and other administrative costs to all functional departments based on headcount. As a result, general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of revenue and each functional operating expense.\nFiscal years ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change\n% of total % of total\nAmount revenue Amount revenue ($) (%)\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 219,494 30 % $ 200,575 27 % $ 18,919 9 %\nSales and marketing 160,544 22 142,420 19 18,124 13\nGeneral and administrative 93,759 13 85,183 11 8,576 10\nTotal operating expenses $ 473,797 65 % $ 428,178 57 % $ 45,619 11 %\nIncludes stock-based compensation of:\nResearch and development $ 29,524 $ 26,324 $ 3,200\nSales and marketing 25,820 21,260 4,560\nGeneral and administrative 25,855 25,073 782\nTotal $ 81,199 $ 72,657 $ 8,542\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our technical staff and consultants providing professional services.\nThe $18.9 million increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increases of $17.6 million in personnel costs associated with higher headcount and bonus attainment that is based on company performance in fiscal year 2021, $2.6 million of cloud infrastructure costs for our development environments, and $0.8 million in professional services costs for consultants that support the development of our subscription offerings, information security requirements and cloud strategy. The increase in personnel costs is net of a $1.2 million benefit related to the CEWS received in fiscal 2021. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel costs of $2.1 million due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.\nOur research and development headcount was 853 as of July 31, 2021 compared with 809 as of July 31, 2020.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to hire and dedicate internal resources to develop, improve, and expand the functionality of our solutions and migrating our solutions to the cloud. Research and development expenses may also increase if we pursue additional acquisitions.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for our sales and marketing employees. Included in our personnel costs are commissions, which are considered contract acquisition costs and are capitalized when earned and expensed over the anticipated period of time that goods and services are expected to be provided to a customer, which we estimate is to be approximately five years. Sales and marketing expenses also includes travel expenses, professional services for marketing activities, and amortization of certain acquired intangibles.\nThe $18.1 million increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to increases of $23.0 million in personnel costs due to higher headcount to sell and market our services and products, including an increase of $3.5 million related to the net effect of the capitalization and amortization of contract acquisition costs (primarily commissions), and $1.0 million in professional services costs to assist in the development of business strategies and customer success alliances. The increase in personnel costs is net of a $0.2 million benefit related to the CEWS received in fiscal year 2021. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $5.3 million in travel costs due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, $0.7 million in marketing and advertising costs mainly due to the hosting of Connections Reimagined as a series of virtual events in fiscal year 2021 compared to an in-person event in fiscal year 2020, and $0.7 million due to lower amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nOur sales and marketing headcount was 426 as of July 31, 2021 compared with 399 as of July 31, 2020.\nWe expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in sales and marketing activities to support our business growth and objectives. Additionally, we anticipate that Connections will be an in-person event in the future, supplemented by virtual content, which may contribute to an increase in sales and marketing expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses include executive, finance, human resources, legal, and corporate development and strategy functions, and primarily consist of personnel costs, as well as professional services.\nThe $8.6 million increase in our general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increases of $7.0 million in personnel-related costs due to higher headcount and bonus attainment that is based on company performance and $1.3 million increase in software and professional services costs to support our growth and remote environment.\nOur general and administrative headcount was 406 as of July 31, 2021 compared with 346 as of July 31, 2020. General and administrative headcount includes personnel in information technology support, information security, facilities, and recruiting whose costs are allocated across all functional departments.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in personnel, corporate infrastructure, and systems required to support our strategic initiatives, the growth of our business, and our compliance and reporting obligations.\nOther Income (Expense)\nFiscal years ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change\nAmount Amount ($) (%)\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nInterest income $ 7,395 $ 24,705 $ (17,310) (70) %\nInterest expense $ (18,711) $ (17,945) $ (766) 4 %\nOther income (expense), net $ 12,619 $ (7,205) $ 19,824 275 %\nInterest Income\nInterest income represents interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments.\nInterest income decreased by $17.3 million in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to lower yields on invested funds and, to a lesser extent, lower funds available for investment due to our share repurchase program.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes both stated interest and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs associated with the $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Senior Notes. The amortization of debt discount and issuance costs are recognized on an effective interest basis. Stated interest expense is consistent in the comparative periods as the outstanding principal and stated interest rate have not changed.\nInterest expense for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 consist of non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $13.6 million and $12.9 million, respectively, and stated interest of $5.0 million in both periods.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net includes foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on monetary asset and monetary liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity in which they are recorded. Our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies in other than the functional currency of the entity in which they are recorded consist primarily of trade accounts receivable, unbilled accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables. We currently have entities with a functional currency of the Argentine Peso, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Danish Kroner, Euro, Indian Rupee, Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, New Zealand Dollar, Polish Zloty, Russian Ruble, and Swiss Franc.\nOther income (expense), net in fiscal year 2021 was income of $12.6 million, compared to expense of $7.2 million in fiscal year 2020, which included a $10.7 million reduction in fair value of one of our strategic investments. Excluding the effect of the reduction in strategic investment fair value, other income increased $9.1 million primarily due to gains from exchange rate movements on monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity in which they were recorded.\nProvision for (benefit from) Income Taxes\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States as well as other tax jurisdictions and countries in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to current U.S. income tax.\nFiscal years ended July 31,\n2021 2020 Change\nAmount Amount ($) (%)\n(In thousands, except percentages)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes $ (37,774) $ 2,867 $ (40,641) (1,418) %\nEffective tax rate 36 % (12) %\nWe recognized an income tax benefit of $37.8 million for fiscal year 2021 compared to an income tax provision of $2.9 million for fiscal year 2020. The increase in our income tax benefit for fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to an increase in pre-tax net loss, the release of a reserve for an uncertain tax position, and the impact related to the tax status change of certain foreign subsidiaries for U.S. tax purposes, partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance.\nAs of July 31, 2021, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $10.9 million that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate as certain unrecognized tax benefits have a valuation allowance.\nThe effective tax rate of 36% for fiscal year 2021 differs from the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate of 21% mainly due to permanent differences for stock-based compensation, including excess tax benefits, the release of a reserve for an uncertain tax position, research and development credits, the tax status change of certain foreign subsidiaries, change in valuation allowance, and certain non-deductible expenses including executive compensation.\nComparison of the Fiscal Years Ended July 31, 2020 and 2019\nRefer to Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located in our 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, filed on September 28, 2020, for the discussion of the comparison of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, the earliest of the three fiscal years presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, making our results of operations variable and difficult to predict. Such factors include those discussed above and those set forth in \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to our Business and Industry-We may experience significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to our Business and Industry-Seasonal sales patterns may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows and may prevent us from achieving our quarterly or annual forecasts, which may cause our stock price to decline\u201d in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. One or more of these factors may cause our results of operations to vary widely. As such, we believe that our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future and that sequential quarterly comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the key business metrics presented above, we believe that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis, for purposes of determining executive and senior management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial results with other software companies because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, our management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included herein and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company\u2019s business.\nThe following table reconciles the specific items excluded from GAAP in the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures for the periods indicated below:\nFiscal years ended July 31,\n2021 2020\nGross profit reconciliation:\nGAAP gross profit $ 368,213 $ 404,292\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nStock-based compensation 33,810 29,160\nAmortization of intangibles 13,175 19,221\nCOVID-19 Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy benefit(1)\n(1,975) -\nNon-GAAP gross profit $ 413,223 $ 452,673\nIncome (loss) from operations reconciliation:\nGAAP income (loss) from operations $ (105,584) $ (23,886)\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nStock-based compensation 115,009 101,817\nAmortization of intangibles 19,965 26,834\nCOVID-19 Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy benefit(1)\n(3,396) -\nNon-GAAP income (loss) from operations $ 25,994 $ 104,765\nNet income (loss) reconciliation:\nGAAP net income (loss) $ (66,507) $ (27,198)\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nStock-based compensation 115,009 101,817\nAmortization of intangibles 19,965 26,834\nAmortization of debt discount and issuance costs 13,617 12,886\nChanges in fair value of strategic investment(2)\n- 10,672\nCOVID-19 Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy benefit(1)\n(3,396) -\nTax impact of non-GAAP adjustments(3)\n(37,379) (19,243)\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) $ 41,309 $ 105,768\nTax provision (benefit) reconciliation:\nGAAP tax provision (benefit) $ (37,774) $ 2,867\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nStock-based compensation (20,979) 16,453\nAmortization of intangibles (4,220) 4,334\nAmortization of debt discount and issuance costs (2,555) 2,080\nChanges in fair value of strategic investment(2)\n- 1,418\nCOVID-19 Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy benefit(1)\n(135) -\nTax impact of non-GAAP adjustments(3)\n65,268 (5,042)\nNon-GAAP tax provision (benefit) $ (395) $ 22,110\nNet income (loss) per share reconciliation:\nGAAP net income (loss) per share - diluted\n$ (0.79) $ (0.33)\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nStock-based compensation 1.39 1.23\nAmortization of intangibles 0.25 0.33\nAmortization of debt discount and issuance costs 0.16 0.16\nChanges in fair value of strategic investment(2)\n- 0.13\nCOVID-19 Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy benefit(1)\n(0.04) -\nTax impact of non-GAAP adjustments(3)\n(0.45) (0.23)\nNon-GAAP dilutive shares excluded from GAAP net income (loss) per share calculation(4)\n(0.03) (0.03)\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) per share - diluted $ 0.49 $ 1.26\nShares used in computing Non-GAAP income (loss) per share amounts:\nGAAP weighted average shares - diluted\n83,577,375 82,855,392\nNon-GAAP dilutive shares excluded from GAAP income (loss) per share calculation(4)\n805,747 834,002\nPro forma weighted average shares - diluted\n84,383,122 83,689,394\n(1) Effective the second fiscal quarter of 2021, the COVID-19 Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy benefit was included as a non-GAAP adjustment. Prior to the second fiscal quarter of 2021, this program was not available.\n(2) Effective the third fiscal quarter of 2020, changes in fair value of strategic investments are excluded from non-GAAP measures. Prior to the third fiscal quarter of 2020, there were no changes in fair value of strategic investments in any periods presented.\n(3) Adjustments reflect the impact on the tax benefit (provision) resulting from all non-GAAP adjustments.\n(4) Due to the occurrence of a net loss on a GAAP basis, potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of GAAP net income (loss) per share, as they would have an anti-dilutive effect. However, these shares have a dilutive effect on non-GAAP net income (loss) per share and, therefore, are included in the non-GAAP net income (loss) per share calculation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are as follows (in thousands):\nJuly 31, 2021 July 31, 2020\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments $ 1,346,591 $ 1,434,267\nWorking capital $ 1,054,971 $ 1,118,020\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments\nOur cash equivalents are comprised of liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase, primarily commercial paper and money market funds. Our investments primarily consist of corporate debt securities, U.S. government and agency debt securities, commercial paper, asset-backed securities, and non-U.S. government securities, which include state, municipal and foreign government securities.\nAs of July 31, 2021, approximately $58.7 million of our cash and cash equivalents were domiciled in various foreign jurisdictions. While we have no current plans to repatriate these funds to the United States, we may repatriate foreign earnings in the future to the extent that the repatriation is not restricted by local laws or there are no substantial incremental costs associated with such repatriation.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn October 2020, our board of directors authorized and approved a stock repurchase program of up to $200.0 million of our outstanding common stock. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, we repurchased 1,488,991 shares of common stock\nat an average price of $109.17 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $162.5 million. As of July 31, 2021, $37.5 million remained available for future share repurchases.\nCash Flows\nOur cash flows from operations are significantly impacted by timing of invoicing and collections of accounts receivable, annual bonus payments, as well as payments of payroll, commissions, payroll taxes, and other taxes. We expect that we will continue to generate positive cash flows from operations on an annual basis, although this may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis. In particular, we typically use more cash during the first fiscal quarter ended October 31, as we generally pay cash bonuses to our employees for the prior fiscal year during that period and seasonally higher sales commissions from increased customer orders booked in our fourth fiscal quarter of the prior year. Additionally, our capital expenditures may fluctuate depending on future office build outs and development activities subject to capitalization.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Our future cash requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of our spending to support our research and development efforts, investments in cloud infrastructure and operating costs, and expansion into other markets. We also may invest in or acquire complementary businesses, applications or technologies, or may expand our board-authorized stock repurchase program, which may require the use of significant cash resources and/or additional financing.\nThe following summary of cash flows for the periods indicated has been derived from our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (in thousands):\nFiscal years ended July 31,\n2021 2020\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 111,587 $ 113,066\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 64,191 $ (5,801)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (159,387) $ 4,955\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.5 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. The decrease in operating cash was primarily attributable to a $55.7 million increase in net loss after excluding the impact of non-cash charges such as deferred taxes, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, change in fair value of our strategic investments, and other non-cash items, partially offset by a $54.2 million increase in cash provided by working capital activity as compared to the prior year.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased by $70.0 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. The increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to an increase of $73.4 million in net cash flows from marketable securities transactions and lower office build out costs of $2.4 million after completing the build out and furnishing of our corporate headquarters in San Mateo, California in fiscal year 2020, offset by a $5.6 million increase in capitalized cloud software development costs and a $0.2 million increase related to strategic investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $164.3 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was due to $161.3 million of repurchased common stock under our share repurchase program and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in proceeds from option exercises of $3.0 million\nContractual Obligations\nOur estimated future obligations consist of leases, royalties, purchase obligations, debt, and unrecognized tax benefits as of July 31, 2021. Refer to Note 8 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d and Note 10 \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough July 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.",

    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nThe Company is structured as a holding company with a business strategy focused on owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities. We are not a \u201cblank check company\u201d as defined in Rule 419 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). We conduct and plan to continue to conduct our activities in such a manner as not to be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). Therefore, no more than 40% of our total assets can be invested in investment securities, as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act. In addition, we do not invest or intend to invest in securities as our primary business. Your rights as a holder of shares, and the fiduciary duties of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and executive officers, and any limitations relating thereto are set forth in the documents governing the Company and may differ from those applying to a Delaware corporation. However, the documents governing the Company specify that the duties of its directors and officers will be generally consistent with the duties of a director of a Delaware corporation.\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors will oversee the management of the Company and our businesses. Initially, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors will be comprised of seven (7) directors, with five (5) of those directors appointed by holders of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock and two (2) of those directors appointed by holders of the Company\u2019s Class B common stock, and at least five (5) of whom will be the Company\u2019s independent directors.\nWe have accumulated a deficit of $11,030,550 as of December 31, 2020 and will likely require significant additional capital to implement our business plan.\nBusiness Strategy and Core Strengths\nWe anticipate that the operating businesses we acquire will be managed on a decentralized basis with essentially no centralized or integrated business functions (such as sales, marketing, purchasing, legal or human resources) and minimal involvement by the Company\u2019s corporate senior management teams in the day-to-day business activities of the operating businesses. The Company\u2019s corporate senior management team anticipates that it will participate in and have ultimate responsibility for significant decisions, such as capital allocation, investment activities and the selection of a chief executive officer for each of the operating businesses. We will also be responsible for establishing, implementing and monitoring corporate governance policies and practices, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in the resolution of governance-related issues as needed.\nWe expect that our business activities at the holding company level will be are managed by a small senior corporate management team, who will research and identify attractive investment opportunities; delegate responsibilities to competent and motivated managers; set operating subsidiary goals; assist managers in the achievement of those goals; define risk parameters; develop appropriate incentive programs; and monitor progress against long-term objectives.\nWe believe that our outlook on length of ownership and active management on our part may alleviate the concern that many stakeholders in potential control transactions may have with regard to their businesses going through multiple sale processes in a short period of time. We believe this outlook reduces both the risk that securities or whole businesses may be sold at unfavorable points in the overall market cycle and enhances our ability to develop a comprehensive strategy to grow the earnings and cash flows of each of our businesses, which we expect will better enable us to meet our long-term corporate objectives of increasing shareholder value.\nOur objective is to grow intrinsic value per share at an attractive rate by retaining capital to reinvest in the productive capabilities of our current subsidiaries, make opportunistic investments, and/or invest in new, anticipated durable earnings streams. Each of these options for capital will be compared to one another on a regular basis, and capital will be deployed according to our management\u2019s judgment as to where it believes allocated capital has the potential to achieve the best long-term return.\nInvestment Strategy\nWe will seek to focus on acquiring operating businesses and securities that (a) can be purchased at what we believe to be a fair price relative to intrinsic value, (b) are managed by competent and incentivized management teams, (c) offer reasonable downside protection and (d) directly contribute to the Company\u2019s strategic goals. Over time, we believe that a focus on these objectives should allow us to consistently deliver targeted investment returns that outperforms the broader market. We plan to target investments into businesses that we believe (i) operate in industries with stable long-term operating profiles, (ii) present a stable unlevered free cash flow profile, (iii) have the ability to quickly adapt to changing economic cycles and (iv) face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence.\nWe believe that an investment strategy focused on investments with these character traits coupled with a value investing orientation should continue to present attractive investment opportunities that allow us to build a less correlated portfolio of operating assets that provide shareholders with exposure to a mix of growth and acyclical operating assets that allow us to maximize shareholder value.\nManagement Strategy\nOur management strategy involves the financial and operational management of the businesses that we anticipate acquiring in a manner that seeks to grow earnings and cash flow and, in turn increasing stockholder value. In general, we plan to oversee and support the management team of each of our businesses by, among other things:\n\u25cf recruiting and retaining talented managers to operate our businesses by using structured incentive compensation programs, including minority equity ownership, tailored to each business;\n\u25cf regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals:\n\u25cf assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies:\n\u25cf identifying and working with management to execute on attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; and\n\u25cf forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives\nOur investment strategy centers around our ability to consistently seek to acquire securities and/or companies at a discount to intrinsic value as determined by various metrics, including without limitation, replacement cost, break-up value, cash flow and earnings power and liquidation value.\nWe utilize a process-oriented, research-intensive, value-based investing approach. This approach generally involves three (3) critical steps: (i) fundamental credit, valuation, capital structure and security analysis; (ii) intense analysis of fulcrum issues, such as litigation, taxes and regulation, that often affect valuation; and (iii) a deep understanding and analysis of contextual factors that often affect the risk-adjusted attractiveness of an investment position. This approach focuses on exploiting market price dislocations that create attractive buying opportunities. These dislocations may be caused by such factors as broad-based market drawdowns; busted auction processes; out of favor, short term industry perceptions; market euphoria; litigation; complex contingent liabilities; corporate malfeasance and weak corporate governance; general bearish economic conditions; and / or complex and inappropriate capital structures.\nWhile we plan to principally focus on deploying a material portion of our investable capital into acquiring controlling interests in privately held and/or thinly traded middle market operating businesses, we may employ a number of acquisition strategies and are permitted to invest across a variety of industries and types of securities including: (i) publicly traded equities; (ii) publicly traded bonds and privately issued, non-investment grade debt, bank debt and other corporate obligations; and (iii) privately issued and publicly traded structured equity and other preferred equity securities.\nKey Elements of Our Strategy:\nThe key elements of our business strategy include the following:\n\u25cf Seek to Acquire Undervalued Assets. We intend to make investments in businesses that we believe are undervalued and have potential for growth. We will also seek to capitalize on investment opportunities arising from market inefficiencies, economic or market trends that have not been identified and reflected in market value, or complex or special situations. Certain opportunities may arise from companies/assets that experience busted sell-side auction processes, disappointing financial results, liquidity or capital needs, lowered credit ratings, revised industry forecasts or legal complications. We may acquire businesses or assets directly or we may establish an ownership position through the purchase of debt or equity securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.\n\u25cf Utilize a Low-Cost Model. We believe our low overhead model will allow us to more effectively utilize excess cash flows from our portfolio of operating businesses and securities to enhance stockholder through efficient capital allocation activities.\n\u25cf Internal Resources and External Network Sufficient to Drive Accretive Opportunities. We believe our internal management team and their strong relationships with industry executives, accountants, attorneys, business brokers, commercial and investment bankers, and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities offer us a strong pipeline of opportunities. Additionally, the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions allows us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.\n\u25cf Drive Accountability and Financial Discipline in the Management of our Business. Our management team is accountable directly to our board of directors and has day-to-day responsibility for general oversight of our business and for capital allocation decisions of our operating businesses. We continually evaluate our operating subsidiaries with a view towards maximizing value and cost efficiencies, bringing an owner\u2019s perspective to our operating businesses. In each of these businesses, we will look for senior management teams with the expertise to run their businesses and boards of directors to oversee the management of those businesses. Each management team will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of its businesses and directly accountable to its board of directors.\nCompetition\nIn our core business, which is the acquisition of operating businesses and securities, we face intense competition, including competition from companies with significantly greater resources than us, and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our market share may decline, and our business could be harmed.\nEmployees\nAs of the date of this report, we had six (6) employees. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.\nPotential Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business\nThe adverse public health developments and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Particularly, the COVID-19 pandemic could potentially lead to an extended economic downturn, which would likely make it more difficult to identify and acquire potential candidates, as well as limit the availability of acquisition financing. The Company cannot accurately predict the effect the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company.\nCorporate Information\nThe Company was originally incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 4, 2012 under the name Snap Online Marketing, Inc. We changed our name on January 31, 2014 to LifeLogger Technologies Corp. and on April 10, 2019, we reincorporated in Delaware under the name Capital Park Holdings Corp. On December 19, 2019, we changed our name to Bridgeway National Corp. Our executive offices are located at 1015 15th Street NW, Suite 1030, Washington DC 20005 and our telephone number is (202) 846-7689.\nChange in Control Transaction\nOn January 9, 2019, the Company entered into a Note Conversion Agreement (the \u201cConversion Agreement\u201d) with SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1, a statutory series of Delaware limited liability corporation (\u201cSBI\u201d), and Old Main Capital, LLC, a Florida series limited liability corporation (\u201cOld Main\u201d). Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, SBI converted $549,042 of principal and $641,565 accrued interest owed to SBI by the Company pursuant to a promissory Note into 42,429 shares of the Company\u2019s Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d), in full satisfaction of such obligation. Pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, Old Main converted $556,547 of principal and $650,094 accrued interest owed to Old Main by the Company pursuant to a promissory Note into 54,000 shares of the Company\u2019s Series B Preferred Stock in full satisfaction of such obligation. Concurrently with and the closing of the transactions for the Old Main Conversion Shares, with an effective date of January 9, 2019, the Company acquired from Old Main and SBI 83,796 shares of Class A Common Stock and from a prior executive of the Company, 1,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The purchase price for the Class A Common Stock was $335.18 in the aggregate and the purchase price for the Series A Preferred Stock was $1 in the aggregate. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company declared $39,391 in dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, of which $28,073 was paid in cash by a related party and $11,318 accrued. During the year ended December 31,2020, the Company declared $43,048 in dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock of which $0 was paid in cash, $43,048 was accrued.\nContemporaneously with the share sale and purchase transaction, Stewart Garner resigned as the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and director and Eric C .Blue, a principal of the Fund was appointed as the Company\u2019s Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Investment Officer and a director. Moreover, we changed our business focus from the development of proprietary cloud-based software programs to our current business of acquiring majority or minority interests in operating businesses.\nAs a result of the foregoing transaction, a \u201cchange in control\u201d of the Company was deemed to have taken place (the \u201cChange in Control Transaction\u201d).\nRecent Developments\nEquity Purchase Agreement\nOn October 24, 2019, the Company entered into an equity purchase agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with SBI Investments LLC, 2014-1, a statutory series of Delaware limited liability company (\u201cSBI\u201d) and Oasis Capital, LLC, a Puerto Rico limited liability company (\u201cOasis\u201d and together with SBI, the \u201cEquity Purchasers\u201d), pursuant to which the Equity Purchasers agreed to, in the aggregate between them, purchase from the Company, up to $10,000,000 (the \u201cMaximum Commitment Amount\u201d) of our share of common stock.\nUnder the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to direct an Equity Purchaser, by its delivery of a put notice (the \u201cPut Notice\u201d) from time to time beginning on the execution date of the Purchase Agreement and ending on the earlier to occur of (a) the date on which the Equity Purchasers shall have purchased Put Shares equal to the Maximum Commitment Amount, (b) October 24, 2021 or (c) written notice of termination by the Company to the Equity Purchasers (together, the \u201cCommitment Period\u201d), to purchase Put Shares (as defined below).\nNotwithstanding any other terms of the Purchase Agreement, in each instance (a) the amount that is the subject of a Put Notice (the \u201cInvestment Amount\u201d) is not more than the Maximum Put Amount (as defined below), (b) the aggregate Investment Amount of all Put Notices shall not exceed the Maximum Commitment Amount and (b) the Company cannot deliver consecutive Put Notices and/or consummate closings to the same Equity Purchaser and must alternate between Oasis and SBI. \u201cMaximum Put Amount\u201d means the lesser of (a) such amount that equals 250% of the average daily trading volume of our shares and (b) $1,000,000. The price paid for each share (the \u201cPurchase Price\u201d) subject to a Put Notice (the \u201cPut Shares\u201d) shall be 85% of the Market Price (as defined below) on the date upon which the Purchase Price is calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement. \u201cMarket Price\u201d means the one lowest traded price of the shares on the principal market for any trading day during the Valuation Period (as defined below), as reported by Bloomberg Finance L.P. or other reputable source. \u201cValuation Period\u201d means the period of five consecutive trading days immediately following the Clearing Date (as defined below) associated with the applicable Put Notice during which the Purchase Price of the shares is valued, provided, however, that the Valuation Period shall instead begin on the Clearing Date if the respective Put Shares are received via DWAC in the applicable selling stockholder\u2019s brokerage account prior to 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on the respective Clearing Date. \u201cClearing Date\u201d means the date on which an Equity Purchaser receives the Put Shares via DWAC in its brokerage account.\nAs compensation for the commitments made under the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid to the Equity Purchasers a commitment fee equal to 4% of the Maximum Commitment Amount (the \u201cCommitment Fee\u201d). The Commitment Fee was paid by the Company by issuing to the Equity Purchasers 28,572 shares of its Series B Preferred Stock, which shares were authorized for issuance on February 25, 2020 (\u201cSeries B Preferred Shares\u201d).\nConcurrently with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company and the Equity Purchasers entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of October 24, 2019 (the \u201cRegistration Rights Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company has filed a registration statement covering the resale by the Equity Purchasers of any Put Shares which may be issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and any and Shares which may be issued upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Shares. The effectiveness of this registration statement is a condition to the ability of the Company to issue a Put Notice to an Equity Purchaser and consummate the sale of the applicable number of Put Shares to such Equity Purchaser.\nOn April 15, 2021 the Company notified the Equity Purchasers of its intent to terminate the Purchase Agreement effective immediately. The Series B Preferred Shares issued to the equity purchased which represented the Commitment fee will remain outstanding and the commitment fee which was previously recorded as deferred financing costs was immediately expensed during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPromissory Note Purchase Agreement\nOn March 2, 2020 (the \u201cIssue Date\u201d), Bridgeway entered into an unsecured promissory note purchase agreement with SBI, on behalf of itself and the other note purchasers (the \u201cNote Purchasers\u201d), pursuant to which the Note Purchasers purchased from the Company (a) 12% convertible promissory notes of the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $845,000 (the \u201c12% Notes\u201d) convertible into Shares (the \u201cConversion Shares\u201d) of and (b) warrants (the \u201cWarrants\u201d) to acquire up to 1,111,842 Shares subject to a beneficial ownership cap of no greater than 4.99% in the case of each Purchaser (the \u201cWarrant Shares\u201d).\nThe maturity date of the 12% Notes shall be on that day that is nine (9) months after the Issue Date (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d) and is the date upon which the principal amount of the 12% Notes, as well as all accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, shall be due and payable. As of the date of filing, the 12% Notes are in default.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIntroduction\nPrior to the Change in Control Transaction that took place on January 9, 2019, we were a lifelogging software company that developed and hosted a proprietary cloud-based software solution \u200eaccessible on iOS and Android devices that offers an enhanced media experience for consumers by augmenting \u200evideos, livestreams and photos with additional context information and provided platform that makes it easy to \u200efind and use that data when viewing or sharing media. Subsequent to the Change in Control Transaction, we changed the business plan wherein we intend to be structured as a holding company \u200ewith a business strategy focused on owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of diverse business activities.\u200e\nResults of Operations\nThe following comparative analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative audited consolidated financial statements, footnotes and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report.\nRevenue\nThe Company had no revenues in 2020 nor 2019. The Company currently cannot predict when the Company will become revenue producing.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for 2020 increased by $1,722,609, compared to 2019, mainly as a result of an increase in general and administrative, expenses incurred in connection with the Company\u2019s decision to broaden its business strategy.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses for 2020 increased by $2,002,455 compared to 2019 as a result of the valuation of certain derivative warrants and notes, together with a material increase in the interest expense.\nNet Profit (Loss)\nThe net loss for 2020 was ($4,124,783), a decrease of $4,347,622 compared to a net profit in 2019 of $222,839, as a result of an increase in other expenses and total operating expenses as a result of an increase in general administrative expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of December 31, 2020, our working capital deficit amounted to $3,783,009 a decrease of $778,181 as compared to $14,067 as of December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily a result of a increase in accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in related party liabilities, notes payable and derivative liabilities and current assets.\nNet cash used in operating activities was ($1,116,865) during 2020 compared to ($3,865,334) in 2019. The increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to our operating performance going from a net profit of $222,839 in fiscal 2019 to ($4,124,783) in fiscal 2020 coupled with the Company entering into certain derivative warrant and note transactions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during 2020 was $1,203,686 compared to $33,870,020 in 2019. This change was due to notes disclosed in previous sections.\nNet cash used in investing activities was ($84,906) during 2020 compared to ($30,004,686) in 2019. This change was due to thirty-million used in investing activities from discontinued operations during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCapital Resources\nWe believe that our balance sheet cash will afford us with sufficient financing to cover immediate our projected operating expenses and working capital needs. However, in order to execute our business plan, we potentially will have to issue additional debt or equity or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party to carry out some aspects of our business plan. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms when needed.\nGoing Concern Consideration\nWe had an accumulated deficit of $11,030,550 as of December 31, 2020. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital and generate additional revenues and profits from our business plan.\nIn the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year end December 31, 2020, our auditor included a statement that as a result of our deficit accumulated on December 31, 2020, our net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended, there is a substantial doubt as our ability to continue as a going concern without rising additional capital and generating additional revenues and profits from our business plan. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 of our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe following person listed below have been retained to provide services as our director until the qualification and election of his successor. All holders of our common stock have the right to vote for directors.\nThe board of directors has primary responsibility for adopting and reviewing implementation of the business plan of the registrant, supervising the development business plan, review of the officers\u2019 performance of specific business functions.

Mr. Blue brings to the Company over 15 years of private equity, advisory and legal experience and will be responsible for driving the Company\u2019s overall strategy. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Blue was the founder and managing partner of a middle market focused private investing platform that focused on control and non-control transactions. In addition to his direct investing experience and prior to founding Capital Park Management Company, Mr. Blue served as an M&A and capital markets attorney as well as an industrials\u2019 focused corporate finance and M&A investment banker. Mr. Blue graduated summa cum laude from Xavier University of Louisiana with a B.S. in finance and graduated with honors from The University of Texas School of Law.\nEon Washington, age 41, has been the COO of the Company since August 1, 2020. Mr. Washington brings to the Company over 19 years of Finance, Accounting, and Business Strategy experience and is responsible for general operations of the overall platform. Prior to joining the Company, My Washington was the Sr. VP of Business Development of a SaaS developer. In addition to his business strategy, Mr. Washington spent 10 years as ERP consultant to SMEs and Non-Profits. Mr. Washington Graduated from Hampton University with a B.S. in Finance/Accounting. .\nCompliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.\nBased solely upon our review of copies of such forms received by us, we believe that, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we are not aware that any officer, director or 10% or greater shareholder failed to file on a timely basis, as disclosed in the aforementioned Forms, reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during the l year ended December 31, 2020.\nCode of Ethics\nThe Company adopted a written code of ethics that applies to the Company\u2019s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller and any persons performing similar functions.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nWe do not have standing audit, nominating or compensation committees, or committees performing similar functions. Our board of directors believes that it is not necessary to have standing audit, nominating or compensation committees at this time because the functions of such committees are adequately performed by our board of directors.\nBoard Oversight in Risk Management\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is our principal executive officer, is our sole director. In the context of risk oversight, we believe that our selection of one person to serve in both positions provides the board of directors with additional perspective which combines the operational experience of a member of management with the oversight focus of a member of the board of directors. The business and operations of our Company are managed by our board of directors as a whole, including oversight of various risks, such as operational and liquidity risks, that our Company faces. Because our board of directors includes a member of our management, this individual is responsible for both the day-to-day management of the risks we face as well as the responsibility for the oversight of risk management."

BUSINESS\nOverview of Business\nBlackboxstocks, Inc. is a financial technology and social media hybrid platform offering real-time proprietary analytics and news for stock and options traders of all levels. Our web-based software (the \u201cBlackbox System\u201d) employs \u201cpredictive technology\u201d enhanced by artificial intelligence to find volatility and unusual market activity that may result in the rapid change in the price of a stock or option. We continuously scan the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), NASDAQ, Chicago Board Options Exchange (the \u201cCBOE\u201d), and other options markets, analyzing over 8,000 stocks and over 1,000,000 options contracts multiple times per second. We provide our users with a fully interactive social media platform that is integrated into our dashboard, enabling our users to exchange information and ideas quickly and efficiently through a common network. We recently introduced a live audio/video feature that allows our members to broadcast on their own channels to share trading strategies and market insight within the Blackbox community. We employ a subscription based Software as a Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) business model and maintain a growing base of users that spans 42 countries.\nThe Blackbox System is a unique and disruptive financial technology platform combining proprietary analytics and broadcast enabled social media to connect traders of all types worldwide on an intuitive, user-friendly system. The complexity of our backend analytics is neatly hidden from the end user by our simple and easy to navigate dashboard which includes real-time alerts, scanners, financial news, institutional grade charting and proprietary analytics.\nDevelopment of the Blackbox System\nThe Blackbox System was made available for use to subscribing customers worldwide in September 2016. In December 2017, we launched our first Options Flow Scanner as a new feature on our platform. Our Options Flow Scanner is designed to monitor and alert our users to unusual activity on the options exchange. We have created many proprietary options alerts and a proprietary options \u201cheatmap\u201d to allow our users to follow large options purchases in real-time. This has proven to be a very popular feature for our users. We also added a Dark Pool Scanner in 2020. The Dark Pool Scanner feature monitors, tracks and displays large blocks of stock that are often purchased in dark pools and not on the regular exchanges. In October of 2020 we completed a system integration with the online brokerage platform TradeStation. This integration allows Blackbox users that have an account with TradeStation to trade directly through the Blackbox platform without leaving our dashboard.\nWe also provide our users with a full set of internal social media functions within our dashboard. These features include chat rooms, direct messaging, follow/block capability, custom user profiles, and most importantly broadcast enabled audio channels. We believe that combining these social media features with our analytics, within a single dashboard provides a unique user experience allowing for the rapid exchange of information and consensus throughout our community. The resulting dynamic is what we describe as \u201cthe best of man and machine\u201d.\nWe are in the process of developing and anticipate adding many new features and functions to the Blackbox System, including but not limited to, native iOS and Android mobile applications, a crypto currency analytics and trading platform, as well as a comprehensive watchlist and portfolio management system. In January of 2021 we deployed an intermediate native application for iOS an Android phones to send push notifications to our users which allowed us to cease using a third-party solution that was inefficient and cumbersome. We are also in the process of upgrading our current chat and audio broadcast feature. Development of planned features and functions are expected to cost approximately $250,000.\nMarketing of the Blackbox System\nThe Company launched its Blackbox System web application for domestic use and made it available to subscribers in September 2016. Use of the Blackbox System is sold on a monthly or annual subscription basis to individual consumers through our website at http://www.blackboxstocks.com. We believe our Blackbox System subscriptions are priced competitively with similar web-based trading tools. We primarily use a combination of digital marketing campaigns and customer referral compensation plans in our advertising program. Our digital advertising efforts utilize banner and similar marketing on social media platforms as well as targeted email. We believe that this form of advertising has been and will continue to be effective in attracting subscribers. We continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of specific social media platforms and allocate marketing funds accordingly. We also promote our subscriptions through an established compensated customer referral program. We offer certain subscribers the right to promote the Blackbox System and receive referral fees for subscribers generated from such subscribers\u2019 effort. Generally, we pay referring subscribers $25 for each subscription generated and $25 for each month the subscriber continues their subscription. We incurred $272,908 and $121,227 in customer referral expenditures in each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to continue utilizing the customer referral sales program as it has proven to be an extremely efficient form of advertising. Our advertising and marketing expense was $705,706 and $261,470 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We intend to continue to deploy a significant amount of marketing funds on both digital campaigns and customer referral programs in the future. In addition, we may also utilize television and radio advertising.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of trademark and copyright laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights, which are primarily our brand names, product coding and marks. As of the date of this report, the Company has not yet registered any trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property associated with our business.\nGovernment Regulation and Approvals\nThe Company offers its subscribing customers a trading tool and not a trading platform, broker dealer or exchange, and therefore does not expect to be subject to regulatory oversight by the SEC, FINRA or other financial regulatory agencies. We are not aware of any governmental regulations or approvals required for the marketing or use of our Blackbox System or the services provided.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. The principal resources necessary for the development of investment software tools and services and knowledgeable personnel to conduct all phases of development and marketing operations are limited. We must compete for such resources with startups, major financial services companies and midsize competitors. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours.\nWe consider our platform unique and do not consider any trading tools or trading analytics software direct competitors of our Company. There are many trading tools on the current market often referred to as \u201cscanners\u201d, that provide features, functions and analytics similar to those of the Blackbox System. There are also many social media platforms that cater to stock traders that serve as real-time informational sources. However, we believe that our Blackbox System is the only platform that has successfully merged a comprehensive analytics system or \u201cscanner\u201d and a social media platform within the same \u201cdashboard\u201d allowing users to view the same real-time data in parallel. Our Blackbox System creates a unique community for traders that can all share the same information and analyze this information on an identical analytics in real-time. We also consider our system unique because our predictive algorithms automatically populate alerts for active stocks with high probability of short-term gains. In spite of these factors that differentiate us, we believe the following companies that could be considered competitors due to some like features and retail price point: Trade Ideas, Flow Algo, Trade Alert and Wall Street Jesus.\nEmployees\nAs of March 30, 2021, the Company has 7 full-time employees and one part-time employee. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.\nAdditional Information\nWe file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) on a regular basis, and disclose certain material events in current reports on Form 8-K. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the Public Reference Room at the SEC located at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The public may also obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov.\nWe make available, free of charge on our website (http://www.blackboxstocks.com), our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K (and any amendments to such reports) as soon as reasonably practical after such reports are filed. Information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this report and should not be considered part of this report or any other filing that we make with the SEC.",

Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201ccontinuing,\u201d \u201congoing,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a financial technology and social media hybrid platform offering real-time proprietary analytics and news for stock and options traders of all levels. Our web-based software employs \u201cpredictive technology\u201d enhanced by artificial intelligence to find volatility and unusual market activity that may result in the rapid change in the trading price of a stock or option. Our Blackbox System continuously scans the NASDAQ, NYSE, CBOE, and other options markets, analyzing over 8,000 stocks and up to 1,000,000 options contracts multiple times per second. We also provide our users with a fully interactive social media platform that is integrated into our dashboard, enabling our users to exchange information and ideas quickly and efficiently through a common network. We recently introduced a live audio/video feature that allows our members to broadcast on their own channels to share trade strategies and market insight within the Blackbox community.\nWe launched our platform for domestic use and made it available to subscribers in September 2016. Subscriptions for the use of the platform are sold on a monthly and/or annual subscription basis to individual consumers through our website at http://www.blackboxstocks.com.\nOur principal office is located at 5430 LBJ Freeway, Suite 1485, Dallas, Texas 75240 and our telephone number is (972) 726-9203. Our Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Pink under the symbol \u201cBLBX.\u201d Our corporate website is located at http://www.blackboxstocks.com.\nBasis of Presentation of Financial Information\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern, which is dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain sufficient financing or establish itself as a profitable business. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $7,184,818 and $6,829,907, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company incurred net losses of $354,911 and $2,983,438, respectively. In November 2020, the Company executed a Loan Agreement with certain lenders (the \u201cLenders\u201d) and FVP Servicing LLC, (\u201cFVP\u201d), as agent for the Lenders in connection with the issuance of a Note in the amount of $1,000,000 bearing interest at 12% per annum with an initial maturity of November 12, 2022. Simultaneously, with the execution of the Loan Agreement, the Company repaid an existing secured note payable in the amount of $100,000 along with accrued interest, and certain outstanding trade payables in the amount of $133,880. In addition, the Company granted the Lender a security interest in substantially all of its assets. As a result of this financing and the cash flows from operations, the Company had a cash balance of $972,825 at December 31, 2020. Management believes that this will be sufficient to fund its operations and service its debt for the next twelve months. In addition, management may continue to raise additional debt or equity capital in order to improve liquidity or finance more aggressive growth or development. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional capital or on what terms.\nThe financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and through March 31, 2021, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d). Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nAll other new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective or adopted have been deemed not to be relevant to us, hence are not expected to have any impact once adopted.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe Company\u2019s financial statement preparation requires that management make estimates and assumptions which affect the reporting of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in order to report these financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash\nCash includes all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. In general, fair values of financial instruments are based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value. These adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and the customer\u2019s creditworthiness, among other things, as well as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nFASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement requires bifurcation of certain embedded derivative instruments, and measurement at their fair value for accounting purposes. A holder redemption feature embedded in the Company\u2019s notes payable requires bifurcation from its host instrument and is accounted for as a freestanding derivative.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d). Each of these pronouncements, as applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. Management does not believe the adoption of any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nProperty and Equipment\nThe Company\u2019s property and equipment is being depreciated on the straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of three years.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company will recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.\nManagement evaluates the probability of the realization of its deferred income tax assets. Management determined that because the Company has not yet generated taxable income, it is unlikely that a tax benefit will be realized from these operating loss carry forwards. Accordingly, the deferred income tax asset is offset by a full valuation allowance.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be capable of withstanding examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nEarnings or (Loss) Per Share\nBasic earnings per share (or loss per share), is computed by dividing the earnings (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution of securities by including other potentially issuable shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon conversion of convertible securities or exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Therefore, because including shares issuable upon conversion of convertible securities and/or exercise of outstanding options and warrants would have an anti-dilutive effect on the loss per share, only the basic earnings (loss) per share is reported in the accompanying financial statements for period of loss.\nShare-Based Payment\nUnder ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, all share based payments to employees, including share option grants, are to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values. No share based payments were issued for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized from the sale of subscriptions for the use of the Blackbox System web application, on a monthly or annual basis. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. The performance obligation by the Company is in exchange for the monthly subscription fee, the subscriber is allowed access to the Blackbox System on the website for the calendar month. Revenue related to annual subscriptions is recognized each month with unearned subscriptions reflected as a current liability.\nOther Liabilities\nThe Company planned the development of a future product, a complimentary platform to share its IP protocol with the current Blackbox System on a subscription basis. The future product was not developed and launched. The Company received advance payments from a new subscriber group in anticipation of the development of this future product and the amounts were deferred and in the first quarter 2021 the subscribers agreed to terminate those agreements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has received $180,000 from this future subscriber group.\nPrepaid Expenses\nPrepaid expenses are current assets created when the Company makes payments or incurs an obligation for expenses identified for a future period. These amounts are charged to expense as the services are provided.\nContingencies\nCertain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company\u2019s management and legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company\u2019s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company\u2019s financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantee would be disclosed.\nReclassification\nAffiliate referral expenses totaling $121,227 for the year ended December 31, 2019 have been reclassed from cost of revenues to advertising and marketing expense on the statement of operations. Also data feed expenses in the aggregate of $79,691 have been reclassed from software development costs as of December 31, 2019 to cost of revenue.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had a cash balance of $972,825 and a working capital deficit of $990,738 as compared to a cash balance of $21,172 and a working capital deficit of $3,525,306 at December 31, 2019. In addition, the Company incurred a net loss of $354,911 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company generated cash flow from operations of $143,580 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to cash used by operations of $710,992 in the prior year.\nThe Company believes that it has sufficient capital resources to fund its current operations and debt service requirements.\nLoan Agreement\nOn November 12, 2020, the Company executed a Loan Agreement with certain lenders (the \u201cLenders\u201d) and FVP Servicing LLC, (\u201cFVP\u201d), as agent for the Lenders in connection with the issuance of a Note (the \u201cFPV Note\u201d) in the amount of $1,000,000 bearing interest at 12% per annum with an initial maturity of November 12, 2022. Simultaneously, with the execution of the Loan Agreement, the Company repaid an existing secured note payable in the amount of $100,000 along with accrued interest and certain outstanding trade payables in the amount of $133,880.\nSale of Common Stock and Warrants\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received subscriptions for the purchase of 346,533 shares of Common Stock at a cash price of $1.95 per share for aggregate cash consideration of $407,982 In connection with certain of the sales, warrants to purchase up to 35,259 shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at a cash price of $1.95 per share were issued to certain of the subscribers.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also issued an aggregate of 104,339 shares of Common Stock, for settlement of debt obligations and services rendered valued at $205,950.\nAdditional funding is expected to be generated as necessary through equity financing from the sale of our Common Stock and/or debt. If we are successful in completing equity financing, existing stockholders will experience dilution of their interest in our Company. We do not currently have any financing arranged and we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our Common Stock or debt to fund our plans of operation and ongoing operational expenses.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nFor the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company\u2019s revenue totaled $3,367,563 and $1,062,573, respectively, for which its respective costs of revenues totaled $1,201,320 and $695,076. Revenues increased as a result of an expanded subscription base for monthly revenues. The Company\u2019s revenue from subscriptions grew from $1,037,778 in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $3,340,983 in the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $2,303,205. Gross margin increased to $2,166,243 or 64.3% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to gross margin of $367,497 or 34.6% of revenues for the prior year.\nFor the year ending December 31, 2020, the Company had operating expenses totaling $2,578,941 compared to $1,372,530 for the same period in 2019, an increase of $1,206,411. Operating expenses were 76.6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 129.2% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Selling general and administrative expenses increased by $724, 361 but decreased as a percentage of sales from 98.0% to 52.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher consulting, salary and selling expenses. Advertising and marketing expenses increased by $444,236 to $705,706 for the year ended December 31, 2020 but declined as a percentage of sales to 21.0% as compared to 24.6% for the prior year. In addition, software development costs increased approximately $43,072.\nOperating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 declined by $592,335 to $412,698 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to substantially higher revenues and gross margin being partially offset by higher operating expenses.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.",

    "item_1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of Cyber Exposure solutions. Cyber Exposure is a discipline for managing, measuring and comparing cybersecurity risk in the digital era.\nDigital transformation is driving radical change and is powering the economy and our social infrastructure. A digital-first economy is only sustainable if it is built with a solid cybersecurity foundation. As organizations modernize their IT infrastructures and adopt cloud or hybrid cloud architectures that are no longer housed in the confines of their corporate networks, they have less visibility and control over the security of these assets. Organizations are also increasingly implementing modern solutions, such as Internet of Things, or IoT, devices, web applications and application containers, to enable the rapid development and deployment of new products, services and business models, as well as to drive operational efficiencies. Further, safety-critical Operational Technology, or OT, such as Industrial Control Systems, are now network-connected and must be secured from cybersecurity threats.\nWhile other functions in an organization, such as finance and operations, have a system to help them manage and measure risk, cybersecurity risk has not historically been adequately measured or understood. Our enterprise platform provides a unified view into the organization\u2019s state of security, enables security teams to prioritize and focus their remediation efforts, and translates vulnerability data into actionable business metrics and insights that boards of directors and executives can understand and use to make strategic decisions. We believe our Cyber Exposure solutions are transforming how cybersecurity risk is managed and measured and will help organizations more rapidly embrace digital transformation.\nOur platform offerings provide broad visibility into security issues such as vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, internal and regulatory compliance violations and other indicators of the state of an organization\u2019s security across IT infrastructure and applications, cloud environments and Industrial IoT and OT environments. We also provide deep analytics to help organizations score, trend and compare their cyber exposure over time, and communicate cyber risk in business terms to make better strategic decisions. Our platform offerings integrate and analyze data from our native collectors alongside IT asset, vulnerability and threat data from third-party systems and applications to prioritize security issues for remediation and focus an organization\u2019s resources based on risk and business criticality.\nIn 2020, 2019 and 2018 our total revenue was $440.2 million, $354.6 million and $267.4 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth rates of 24% from 2019 to 2020 and 33% from 2018 to 2019. Our net loss was $42.7 million, $99.0 million and $73.5 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash flows from operating activities were $64.2 million, $(10.7) million and $(2.6) million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur Platform Offerings\nOur vision is to empower every organization to understand and reduce their cybersecurity risk.\nOur Enterprise Platform Offerings\nOur enterprise platform enables organizations to answer foundational and strategic questions such as:\n\u2022Where are we exposed?\n\u2022Where should we prioritize based on risk?\n\u2022Are we reducing our exposure over time?\n\u2022How do we compare to our peers?\nOur enterprise platform offerings include Tenable.io, which is our cloud-delivered software as a service, or SaaS, offering, and Tenable.sc, which is our on-premises offering, both of which provide organizations with a risk-based view of traditional and modern attack surfaces. These applications are designed with views, workflows and dashboards to deliver a complete and continuous view of all assets, both known and previously unknown, and any associated vulnerabilities,\ninternal and regulatory compliance violations, misconfigurations and other cybersecurity issues, prioritize these issues for remediation based on risk assessment and predictive analytics, and provide insightful remediation guidance.\nOur enterprise platform offerings also include Tenable.ot, which is our on-premises solution that provides threat detection and mitigation, asset tracking, vulnerability management, and configuration control capabilities to protect OT environments, including industrial networks. Tenable.ot is sold as a stand-alone solution and integrates with Tenable.io and Tenable.sc.\nOur enterprise platform offerings deliver the following capabilities:\n\u2022Live asset discovery. We can automatically discover a broad range of traditional and modern IT assets, including on-premises infrastructure, web applications, cloud environments, mobile devices, containers, IoT devices and OT systems. We use a combination of active scanning, passive network monitoring and public cloud monitoring via our connector to identify known and unknown assets on the network. Additionally, in 2020 we released Frictionless Assessment, which evaluates cloud assets and detects new vulnerabilities within a dynamic environment without having to schedule a scan or deploy an agent.\n\u2022Automated exposure assessment. With every change in a customer\u2019s computing environment, we can automatically assess and identify where there are vulnerabilities, internal and regulatory compliance violations and misconfigurations across assets and cloud environments, such as missing software patches or outdated software versions. In addition, we can help optimize existing security technology investments to identify indicators of cyber exposure, such as improperly configured anti-virus software.\n\u2022Deep analytics to allow for prioritization. We combine our product, vulnerability data and threat intelligence with third-party data to provide business context and enable organizations to prioritize remediation efforts based on the business criticality of the asset and the likelihood of exploit. Predictive Prioritization enables organizations to reduce business risk by focusing on the vulnerabilities with the greatest likelihood of imminently being exploited. It combines Tenable vulnerability data with third-party threat and vulnerability data across more than 150 data sources using a proprietary machine learning algorithm developed by Tenable Research and data science teams to provide clear guidance on where to focus remediation efforts. Predictive Prioritization provides a threat-based view of vulnerabilities, which is a critical component of modern risk-based vulnerability management.\n\u2022Open and extensible platform. Our enterprise platform integrates with industry-leading IT workflow, security information and event management, or SIEM, and systems management tools to accelerate remediation and provide common visibility across security and IT operations teams.\n\u2022Cyber exposure measurement. Tenable Lumin, released in 2019, leverages our expansive knowledge base of assets and vulnerabilities coupled with data science insights to help our customers objectively score, trend and benchmark cyber exposure across their organizations, including by business unit or geography, for comparison and best practices. We believe this capability is critical to help security executives effectively translate technical information and communicate cybersecurity risk to a non-technical audience, including the C-suite and the board of directors, to make better strategic decisions on where to focus investment to maximize cybersecurity risk reduction. As we continue to expand our database with more vulnerability and asset intelligence as well as additional third-party data sources, we anticipate that we will be able to leverage these insights in Lumin to measure an organization\u2019s cyber exposure beyond vulnerabilities to overall cybersecurity program effectiveness.\nNessus\nOur co-founder is the creator of Nessus, one of the most widely deployed vulnerability assessment solutions in the cybersecurity industry. Nessus underpins our enterprise platform. Since the introduction of Nessus in 1998, an extensive community of Nessus users has emerged. We continue to cultivate knowledge and affinity within this user base, which, when combined with our enterprise customers and our Tenable Research team of cybersecurity and data science experts, creates powerful network effects in the form of a continuous feedback loop of data and insights. We use these learnings to expand our assessment capabilities and coverage, continually optimize our solutions and inform our product strategy and\ninnovation priorities. We believe these data and insights will also fuel and strengthen our benchmarking capabilities over time.\nNessus Professional\nNessus Professional is a vulnerability assessment solution for identifying security vulnerabilities, configuration issues and malware. Nessus Professional serves as both a stand-alone product designed for security consultants and practitioners performing one-time or ad-hoc assessment as well as an on-ramp product to our enterprise platform. With broad vulnerability coverage, accurate analysis and an easy-to-use interface, Nessus Professional offers a cost-effective and comprehensive solution for security consultants and users with ad-hoc assessment needs.\nNessus Essentials\nWe also offer a free version of our Nessus product, Nessus Essentials, which includes vulnerability and configuration assessment for a limited number of assets, but does not include access to support and certain features that Nessus Professional customers enjoy.\nTechnology Architecture\nOur platform is built from the ground up to support the needs of modern IT assets and environments. Our platform\u2019s scalability can meet the requirements of the largest global enterprise customers, which may require assessment for millions of assets.\nFoundational elements of our technology architecture include:\n\u2022Public cloud infrastructure for agility. Our use of the public cloud delivers agility and market responsiveness without the capital investment or time delay involved with planning, purchasing and deploying hardware. It also provides a flexible cost profile in which capacity can be quickly adjusted up or down in response to new opportunities and market demand, with relatively modest fixed costs.\n\u2022Scalability. Our platform scales up and down to continuously meet customer demands, through the use of public cloud infrastructure around the world. This approach provides elastic resources for compute, data transfer and storage, and allows us to meet the needs of even the largest global enterprises and government agencies. Our platform manages and supports millions of assets for multiple enterprise customers across a variety of industries, with the ability to process millions of application programming interface, or API, calls daily. The platform can scale to support IoT deployments that are an order of magnitude larger than IT deployments.\n\u2022Availability. Our modern architecture, leveraging state-of-the-art public cloud services, offers high availability and high performance. It provides geographic redundancy, as well as automated backup, without the need for us to build redundant infrastructure. As a result, we offer a service level agreement for Tenable.io that promises 99.95% availability to help ensure the reliability of operation for our customers.\n\u2022Extensibility and integration. Our open API and software development kit, or SDK, enables import of data from third-party sources and sensors, including competitor products, to augment our native discovery, assessment and analytics. This is essential to providing a unified view of assets, vulnerabilities and exposure across the enterprise. These capabilities also enable flexible export of our data to third party systems.\n\u2022Unified Platform. Our products are built on a unified platform with a unified data model that enables us to share data, assets and vulnerabilities across our applications so our customers can run workflows and have a consistent user experience across our products.\n\u2022Widely adopted industry standard file format. The \u201c.Nessus\u201d file format for vulnerability data used in all of our products is openly documented and supported by dozens of products and programming languages, which simplifies integration with our ecosystem partners\u2019 technologies.\nOur Technology Ecosystem\nWe have partnered and/or integrated with market leading technology companies to pioneer the industry\u2019s first Cyber Exposure ecosystem to help organizations build resilient cybersecurity programs. Our ecosystem consists of a variety of third-party data import sources into our platform offerings, as well as export of our data out to third-party IT systems. Our technology ecosystem connects disparate solutions and data to automate processes and accelerate an organization\u2019s ability to understand, manage and reduce its cyber exposure.\nWe integrate a variety of third-party data sources, including ticketing, configuration management databases, or CMDBs, and systems management, into our platform to augment our native data collection and help with analysis and remediation prioritization. Furthermore, our data is also exported out to enrich third-party IT management and security systems.\nOur Growth Strategy\nOur objectives are to maintain our market leadership in Cyber Exposure and to capture our large market opportunity. To accomplish these objectives, we intend to:\n\u2022Continue to Acquire New Enterprise Platform Customers. We believe there is a substantial opportunity to increase adoption of our enterprise platform offerings. We have experienced growth in new enterprise platform customers due to investments in sales and marketing. We intend to continue to aggressively pursue new domestic and international customers by adding sales capacity and leveraging our network of channel partnerships around the world.\n\u2022Expand Asset Coverage Within Our Customer Base. We believe we have a significant opportunity to expand our relationships with our existing customers by targeting additional teams, business units or geographies, pursuing broad enterprise deployments and generally expanding our coverage of their IT assets and cross-selling new applications and solutions.\n\u2022Invest in Our Technology Platform. We intend to continue to innovate and develop our enterprise platform, including the addition of incremental capabilities, such as coverage of new attack surfaces and asset types and the addition of analytical capabilities, to help our customers measure and benchmark their cyber exposure. As we collect more data and ingest more data from third-party sources, we believe our data set will become even more valuable over time, which will allow us to continue to develop new analytical products and capabilities to our existing product suite over time.\n\u2022Explore Acquisition Opportunities. We may acquire other businesses, technology and/or development personnel that will expand and enhance the functionality of our platform offerings. In 2019, we acquired Indegy Ltd., or Indegy, a leader in industrial cybersecurity that provides visibility, security and control across OT environments. Indegy expanded our depth of OT expertise and intelligence and our breadth of OT-specific capabilities from vulnerability management to asset inventory, configuration management and threat detection.\nCustomers\nWe sell and market our enterprise platform offerings through our field sales force that works closely with our channel partners, which includes a network of distributors and resellers, in developing sales opportunities. We use a two-tiered channel model whereby we sell our enterprise platform offerings to our distributors, which in turn sell to our resellers, which then sell to end users, which we call customers.\nOur customers are located in over 160 countries and include enterprises of all sizes and span a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, energy and industrials; technology, media and telecommunications; banking, insurance and finance; government, education and non-profit; healthcare; and retail and consumer.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had over 30,000 customers who licensed our Tenable.io, Tenable.sc, Tenable.ot or Nessus Professional products. Our customers include more than 50% of the Fortune 500 and over 30% of the Global 2000 organizations at December 31, 2020. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, no single customer represented more than 2% of our revenue.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales strategy employs both a direct-touch approach through our sales forces and a low-touch approach through sales closed by our channel partners and transacted on our e-commerce website. Both direct-touch and channel-originated sales are fulfilled through our channel partnerships. Our sales and customer success renewal teams collaborate closely with our channel partners to prospect, manage and support our customers, developing and maintaining close relationships with all of our enterprise platform customers.\nWe sell to organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries, with a specific focus on enterprise accounts. Our sales team is divided by customer size and geography, including the Americas; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (\"EMEA\"); and Asia Pacific and Japan.\nOur partner ecosystem provides us with a number of advantages, including increased in-bound registered sales leads, broader geographic reach and greater deal velocity. Our channel partners include distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators and managed security service providers.\nOur marketing efforts focus on cultivating brand awareness and leveraging our brand strength with Nessus, building demand across all segments with a specific emphasis on our enterprise customers and delivering tailored marketing programs focused on security executives, functional managers and security practitioners and consultants with Nessus. We also provide educational programs to DevOps teams for our Container Security and Web Application Scanning products. We execute marketing programs targeted at new customer acquisition, customer retention and cross-selling and up-selling of products across our platform.\nResearch and Development\nWe continue to invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platform offerings by developing new features, functionality, and applications. Our engineering expertise combines extensive security product development experience with individuals who possess deep cloud and user interface design background.\nAdditionally, our Tenable Research team includes a team of cybersecurity and data science experts who deliver Cyber Exposure intelligence, data science insights, alerts and security advisories. Frequent updates from Tenable Research ensure the latest vulnerability checks, zero-day research, and configuration benchmarks are available within our Cyber Exposure solutions.\nWe believe ongoing and timely development of new products and features is imperative to maintaining our competitive position. We continue to invest in development of our solutions across our global research and development team.\nOur research and development expense was $101.7 million, $87.1 million and $76.7 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nBacklog\nWe define backlog as contractually committed orders to be invoiced under our existing agreements that are not included in the deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had backlog of $8.0 million and $3.6 million, respectively. We expect substantially all of the backlog at December 31, 2020 to be invoiced within the following twelve months.\nCompetition\nThe market for cybersecurity solutions is fragmented, intensely competitive and constantly evolving. We compete with a range of established and emerging cybersecurity software and services vendors, as well as homegrown solutions. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect the competitive environment to remain intense going forward. Our competitors include: vulnerability management and assessment vendors, including Qualys and Rapid7; diversified security software and services vendors, including IBM; endpoint security vendors with nascent vulnerability assessment capabilities, including Tanium and CrowdStrike; and providers of point solutions that compete with some of the features present in our solutions. We also compete against internally-developed efforts that often use open source\nsolutions.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the market for cybersecurity solutions include product functionality, breadth and depth of offerings, flexibility of delivery models, ease of deployment and use, integration capabilities such as open APIs and scalability, uptime and performance. We believe that our suite of solutions generally competes favorably with respect to these factors and may serve as a complement to the solutions offered by our competitors in some cases. Some of our more established actual and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater resources than we do. In addition, as our market grows and rapidly changes, we expect it will continue to attract new competitors, including companies that are larger and more established than us and smaller emerging companies, which could introduce new products and services.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 21 issued patents and nine patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued patents expire between 2027 and 2038 and cover our network scanning, monitoring and analysis technologies and additional features of our platform offerings. As of December 31, 2020, we had 19 registered trademarks and one trademark application pending in the United States. We view our copyrights, trade secrets and know-how as a significant component of our intellectual property assets.\nWe also license certain software from third parties for integration into our solutions, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot assure you that such third parties will maintain such software or continue to make it available.\nWe control access to and use of our proprietary software and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, unauthorized parties may still attempt to copy, reverse engineer, misappropriate or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.\nGovernment Regulation\nVarious federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies have legislation pending that could affect our business. In particular, the European Union passed the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which came into force on May 25, 2018. The GDPR includes more stringent operational requirements on entities that receive or process personal data (as compared to existing EU law), along with significant penalties for non-compliance, more robust obligations on data processors and data controllers, greater rights for data subjects (potentially requiring significant changes to both our technology and operations), and heavier documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from locations in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having \u201cadequate\u201d data protection laws, and imposes substantial fines for breaches and violations (up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of consolidated annual worldwide gross revenue).\nSimilarly, there are a number of federal and state level legislative proposals in the United States that could impose new obligations on us. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and creates new individual privacy rights for consumers and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling the personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, which could include our employees residing in California based on the broad definitions in the law, to provide such consumers new ways to opt out of certain sales of personal\ninformation, and to allow for a new private cause of action for data breaches. Other states are beginning to pass similar laws. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing more onerous data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or other requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.\nLike other U.S.-based IT security products, our products are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, specifically the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, U.S. economic and trade sanctions regulations and applicable foreign government import, export and use requirements. Certain of our products are subject to encryption controls under the EAR due to the nature of the product and its use or incorporation of encryption functionality. Under the encryption controls in the EAR, applicable products may only be exported outside of the United States with required export authorizations, such as a license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. In addition to the restrictions under the EAR, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the export of products and services to countries, governments, entities or persons subject to U.S. embargoes or trade sanctions.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 1,367 employees, including 455 employees located outside of the United States. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Certain international employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements in connection with local labor laws. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.\nWe believe in upholding a core set of values for our entire global workforce:\n\u2022One Tenable: We are united as one Tenable team. We win together. We are one team internally, with our customers, with our partners and in the market.\n\u2022We Care: About our work, about our customers, about one another and about our communities. We speak straight and we do the right thing.\n\u2022Deliver Results: We set high goals, take bold risks, measure honestly and deliver results that exceed expectations.\n\u2022What We Do Matters: The work that we do makes a difference in the world.\nOur key human capital objectives are to attract, retain and develop our highly talented existing and future employees, while cultivating a diverse and inclusive workforce and environment to achieve exceptional business results. We strive to be a career destination where employees from all backgrounds are welcome and empowered, are treated with fairness and respect, can make a difference, and have the opportunity to grow.\nFinancial Information and Segments\nSegment and geographic information required by Part I, Item 1 of Form 10-K can be found in Note 1 and Note 13 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements, of this Form 10-K.\nCorporate Information\nTenable Network Security, Inc., our predecessor, was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 2002.

Cyber Exposure is a discipline for managing, measuring and comparing cybersecurity risk in the digital era.\nOur enterprise platform offerings include Tenable.io, which is our cloud-delivered software as a service, or SaaS, offering and Tenable.sc, which is our on-premises offering, both of which provide organizations with a risk-based view of traditional and modern attack surfaces. These applications are designed with views, workflows and dashboards to deliver a complete and continuous view of all assets, both known and previously unknown, and any associated vulnerabilities, internal and regulatory compliance violations, misconfigurations and other cybersecurity issues, prioritize these issues for remediation based on risk assessment and predictive analytics, and provide insightful remediation guidance.\nOur enterprise platform offerings also include Tenable.ot, which is our on-premises solution that provides threat detection and mitigation, asset tracking, vulnerability management, and configuration control capabilities to protect OT environments, including industrial networks. Tenable.ot is sold as a stand-alone solution and integrates with Tenable.io and Tenable.sc.\nOur enterprise platform offerings are primarily sold on a subscription basis with a one-year term. Our subscription terms are generally not longer than three years. These offerings are typically prepaid in advance. To a lesser extent, we recognize revenue ratably from perpetual licenses and from the related ongoing maintenance.\nWe sell and market our products and services through our field sales force that works closely with our channel partners, which includes a network of distributors and resellers, in developing sales opportunities. We use a two-tiered channel model whereby we sell our enterprise platform offerings to our distributors, which in turn sell to our resellers, which then sell to end users, which we call customers.\nMany of our enterprise platform customers initially use either our free or paid version of Nessus, one of the most widely deployed vulnerability assessment solutions in the cybersecurity industry. Nessus, which is the technology that underpins our enterprise platform offerings, is designed to quickly and accurately identify security vulnerabilities, configuration issues and malware. Our free version of Nessus, Nessus Essentials, allows for vulnerability assessment over a limited number of IP addresses. We believe many of our Nessus customers begin with Nessus Essentials and subsequently upgrade to Nessus Professional, the paid version of Nessus; however, we expect many users to continue to use Nessus Essentials.\nThere have been more than 2.5 million cumulative unique downloads, which refers to an individual email address utilized to register for the use of Nessus Essentials. We believe that the cumulative number of unique downloads of the free version of Nessus is representative of our brand recognition among cybersecurity professionals and that continued growth in this number suggests broader awareness among potential customers. While we believe that the cumulative number of unique downloads may provide an indication of the growth and scale of our thought leadership and brand\nawareness, we do not expect this metric to necessarily correlate to future revenue growth opportunities, and we do not consider this metric a measure of our operating performance.\nRevenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $440.2 million, $354.6 million and $267.4 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 24% and 33%, respectively. Our recurring revenue, which includes revenue from subscription arrangements for software and cloud-based solutions and maintenance associated with perpetual licenses, represented 93.6%, 91.8% and 89.4% of revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our net loss in 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $42.7 million, $99.0 million and $73.5 million, respectively, as we continue to invest in our business and market opportunity. Our cash flows from operating activities were $64.2 million, $(10.7) million and $(2.6) million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCOVID-19 Update\nWe continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, partners, employees and service providers. While in the near term we may experience reductions in our billing and revenue growth rates, we are proactively managing our expenditures, including reductions of non-critical and discretionary expenses such as travel, meeting and facility usage costs, while preserving strategic investments in sales capacity and research and development. This has and may continue to result in improved leverage related to gross margins as well as sales and marketing, research and development, and general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business and operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain. We may incur additional costs when we resume business-related travel and return to the office, the timing and extent of which remains unknown. For additional information on the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations, see the \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" section below and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nFinancial Highlights\nBelow are our key financial results:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n2020 2019 2018\nRevenue\n$ 440,221 $ 354,586 $ 267,360\nLoss from operations\n(36,433) (90,799) (72,581)\nNet loss\n(42,731) (99,013) (73,521)\nNet loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted\n(0.42) (1.03) (1.38)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities 64,232 (10,744) (2,559)\nPurchases of property and equipment (20,277) (20,674) (5,733)\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nProduct Leadership\nOur enterprise platform offerings provide visibility into the broadest range of traditional and modern IT assets across cloud and on-premises environments. We are intensely focused on continued innovation and ongoing development of our enterprise platform offerings that empower organizations to understand and reduce their cyber exposure. Additionally, we continue to expand the capabilities of our Nessus products, specifically as they relate to the ability to scan for and detect the rapidly expanding volume of vulnerabilities.\nWe intend to continue to invest in our engineering capabilities and marketing activities to maintain our position in the highly-competitive market for cybersecurity solutions. Our results of operations may fluctuate as we make these investments to drive increased customer adoption and usage.\nNew Enterprise Platform Customer Acquisition\nWe believe that our customer base provides a significant opportunity to expand sales of our enterprise platform offerings and that our ability to continue to grow the number of enterprise platform customers will increase future opportunities for renewals and follow-on sales. We believe that we have significant room to increase our market share.\nWe expect to grow our enterprise platform customers by continuing to expand our sales organization and leveraging our channel partner network, which we believe will allow us to identify new enterprise customers, enter new markets, including internationally, as well as to convert more of our existing Nessus Professional customers to enterprise platform customers.\nWe will continue to invest in our partner network and sales and marketing capability in order to grow domestically and internationally.\nRetaining and Expanding Revenue from Existing Customers\nOur enterprise platform offerings utilize IT asset-based or IP address-based pricing models. Once enterprise customers have licensed our platform offerings, they typically seek broader coverage over their traditional IT assets, including networking infrastructure, desktops and on-premises servers. As customers launch new applications or migrate existing applications to the cloud and deploy web applications, containers, IoT and OT, they often increase the scope of their subscriptions and/or add additional perpetual licenses to our enterprise platforms.\nWe are also focused on upselling customers from Nessus Professional to our enterprise platform offerings. Nessus Professional customers are typically organizations or independent security consultants that use Nessus Professional for a single vulnerability assessment at a point in time. We seek to convert these customers to our enterprise platform offerings, which provide continuous visibility and insights into their attack surface, as their needs develop.\nFurther, we plan to expand existing platform capabilities and launch new products, which we believe will drive new product purchases and follow-on purchases over time, thereby contributing to customer renewals. We believe that there is a significant opportunity to drive additional sales to existing customers, and we expect to invest in sales and marketing and customer success personnel and activities to achieve additional revenue growth from existing customers. However, our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our products and services, competition, pricing, current economic conditions or overall changes in our and our clients' spending levels.\nWe evaluate our ability to expand sales with existing customers by assessing our dollar-based net expansion rate on a last twelve months, or LTM, basis. We calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate as follows:\n\u2022Denominator: To calculate our dollar-based net expansion rate as of the end of a reporting period, we first determine the annual recurring revenue, or ARR, from all active subscriptions and maintenance from perpetual licenses as of the last day of the same reporting period in the prior year. This represents recurring payments that we expect to receive in the next 12-month period from the cohort of customers that existed on the last day of the same reporting period in the prior year.\n\u2022Numerator: We measure the ARR for that same cohort of customers representing all subscriptions and maintenance from perpetual licenses based on customer orders as of the end of the reporting period.\nWe calculate dollar-based net expansion rate by dividing the numerator by the denominator.\nOur dollar-based net expansion rate for 2020 was approximately 110% on an LTM basis, which was a decline from prior years and was impacted by a more moderate pace of IT asset and IP address expansion in the current economic environment. Our dollar-based net expansion rate may further decline or fluctuate from quarter to quarter if our existing customers choose to reduce or delay technology spending in response to economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, or as a result of a number of other factors, including our existing customers' satisfaction with our solutions, the pricing of our solutions and the ability of competing solutions and the pricing thereof.\nInvesting in Business Growth\nSince our founding, we have invested significantly in growing our business. We intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our sales team, expand brand and Cyber Exposure awareness and optimize our channel partner network. We also intend to continue to invest in our research and development team to further our technological leadership position in Cyber Exposure and enhance the functionality of our solutions. Any investments we make in our sales and marketing and research and development teams will occur in advance of experiencing the benefits from such investments, so it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating resources in those areas. We may also explore acquisitions of businesses, technology and/or development personnel that will expand and enhance the functionality of our platform offerings. These investment activities could increase our net losses over the short term if our revenue growth does not increase at higher rates. However, we expect that these investments will ultimately benefit our results of operations.\nKey Operating and Financial Metrics\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain operating metrics and non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating and financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors\u2019 overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe believe that these operating metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our operating and financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operational decision-making. We present these operating metrics and non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing our operating and financial performance using a management view and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core operating and financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\nCalculated Current Billings\nWe use the non-GAAP measure of calculated current billings, which we believe is a key metric to measure our periodic performance. Given that most of our customers pay in advance, we typically recognize a majority of the related revenue ratably over time. We use calculated current billings to measure and monitor our ability to provide our business with the working capital generated by upfront payments from our customers.\nCalculated current billings consists of revenue recognized in a period plus the change in current deferred revenue in the corresponding period. We believe that calculated current billings, which excludes deferred revenue for periods beyond twelve months in a customer\u2019s contractual term, more closely correlates with annual contract value. Variability in total billings, depending on the timing of large multi-year contracts and the preference for annual billing versus multi-year upfront billing, may distort growth in one period over another.\nWhile we believe that calculated current billings provides valuable insight into the cash that will be generated from sales of our subscriptions, this metric may vary from period-to-period for a number of reasons, and therefore has a number of limitations as a quarter-to-quarter or year-over-year comparative measure. Calculated current billings in any one period may be impacted by the overall timing of sales, including early renewals, as well as the timing and amount of multi-year prepaid contracts, which could favorably or unfavorably impact year-over-year comparisons. For example, an increasing number of large sales transactions, for which the timing has and will continue to vary, may occur in quarters subsequent to or in advance of those that we anticipate. Our calculation of calculated current billings may be different from other companies that report similar financial measures. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider calculated current billings along with revenue and our other GAAP financial results.\nThe adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers at January 1, 2017 resulted in a $55.0 million increase in deferred revenue primarily related to the deferral of perpetual license revenue.\nThis cumulative adjustment to deferred revenue at January 1, 2017 increased calculated current billings by $1.9 million, $5.6 million, $11.8 million and $16.7 million in 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of revenue, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to calculated current billings:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nRevenue $ 440,221 $ 354,586 $ 267,360\nDeferred revenue (current), end of period 328,819 274,348 213,644\nDeferred revenue (current), beginning of period(1)\n(274,348) (214,069) (154,898)\nCalculated current billings $ 494,692 $ 414,865 $ 326,106\n_______________\n(1) Deferred revenue (current), beginning of period for 2019 includes $0.4 million related to acquired deferred revenue.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe use the non-GAAP measure of free cash flow, which we define as GAAP net cash flows from operating activities reduced by purchases of property and equipment. We believe free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash (if any) that is available, after purchases of property and equipment, for investment in our business and to make acquisitions. We believe that free cash flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash.\nOur use of free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results under GAAP. First, free cash flow is not a substitute for net cash flows from operating activities. Second, other companies may calculate free cash flow or similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison. Additionally, the utility of free cash flow is further limited as it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider free cash flow along with net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and our other GAAP financial measures.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 64,232 $ (10,744) $ (2,559)\nPurchases of property and equipment (20,277) (20,674) (5,733)\nFree cash flow(1)\n$ 43,955 $ (31,418) $ (8,292)\n_______________\n(1) Our employee stock purchase plan impacted free cash flow by $0.9 million, $(0.9) million and $6.3 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Proceeds from lease incentives were $14.2 million in 2020 and capital expenditures related to our new headquarters were $17.2 million and $11.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash payments associated with the Indegy acquisition were $0.7 million and $13.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Free cash flow for 2020 was reduced by approximately $17 million as a result of the accelerated timing of payments for cloud software subscriptions, insurance and rent.\nEnterprise Platform Customers\nWe believe that our customer base provides a significant opportunity to expand sales of our enterprise platform offerings. The following tables summarize key components of our customer base:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nNumber of new enterprise platform customers added in period(1)\n1,455 1,511 1,178\n_______________\n(1) We define an enterprise platform customer as a customer that has licensed Tenable.io or Tenable.sc for an annual amount of $5,000 or greater. New enterprise platform customers represent new customer logos during the periods presented and do not include customer conversions from Nessus Professional to enterprise platforms.\nAt December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nNumber of customers with $100,000 and greater in annual contract value at end of period\n837 641 453\nNon-GAAP Income (Loss) from Operations and Non-GAAP Operating Margin\nWe use non-GAAP income (loss) from operations along with non-GAAP operating margin as key indicators of our financial performance. We define these non-GAAP financial measures as their respective GAAP measures, excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Acquisition-related expenses include transaction expenses and costs related to the transfer of acquired intellectual property.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our core operating results over multiple periods. There are a number of limitations related to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures as compared to GAAP loss from operations and operating margin, including that non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and non-GAAP operating margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of loss from operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to non-GAAP income (loss) from operations, and operating margin, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to non-GAAP operating margin:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(dollars in thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nLoss from operations $ (36,433) $ (90,799) $ (72,581)\nStock-based compensation 59,573 43,443 22,875\nAcquisition-related expenses 339 3,970 -\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 2,314 620 603\nNon-GAAP income (loss) from operations $ 25,793 $ (42,766) $ (49,103)\nOperating margin (8) % (26) % (27) %\nNon-GAAP operating margin 6 % (12) % (18) %\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss), Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) Per Share and Pro Forma Non-GAAP Earnings (Loss) Per Share\nWe use non-GAAP net income (loss), which excludes the effect of the accretion of Series A and B redeemable convertible preferred stock, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as the related tax impact, to calculate non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share and pro forma non-\nGAAP earnings (loss) per share. Pro forma non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is calculated by giving effect to the conversion of our redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock as though the conversion occurred at the beginning of 2018. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide important information to management and investors because they facilitate comparisons of our core operating results over multiple periods.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss and net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, to non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share and pro forma non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands, except for per share amounts) 2020 2019 2018\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (42,731) $ (99,013) $ (73,955)\nAccretion of Series A and B redeemable convertible preferred stock\n- - 434\nStock-based compensation 59,573 43,443 22,875\nTax impact of stock-based compensation(1)\n1,299 (95) (218)\nAcquisition-related expenses 339 3,970 -\nTax impact of acquisition(2)\n- 10,582 -\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets(3)\n2,314 620 603\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) $ 20,794 $ (40,493) $ (50,261)\nNet loss per share attributable to common stockholders, diluted $ (0.42) $ (1.03) $ (1.38)\nAccretion of Series A and B redeemable convertible preferred stock - - 0.01\nStock-based compensation 0.59 0.45 0.42\nTax impact of stock-based compensation(1)\n0.01 - -\nAcquisition-related expenses - 0.04 -\nTax impact of acquisition(2)\n- 0.11 -\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets(3)\n0.02 0.01 0.01\nAdjustment to diluted earnings per share(4)\n(0.01) - -\nNon-GAAP earnings (loss) per share, diluted $ 0.19 $ (0.42) $ (0.94)\nWeighted-average shares used to compute net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, diluted 101,009 96,014 53,669\nWeighted-average shares used to compute non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share, diluted(5)\n109,962 96,014 53,669\nPro forma adjustment to reflect the assumed conversion of our convertible redeemable preferred stock as of the beginning of the period - - 31,107\nWeighted-average shares used to compute pro forma non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share, diluted 109,962 96,014 84,776\nPro forma non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share, diluted $ 0.19 $ (0.42) $ (0.59)\n________________\n(1) The tax impact of stock-based compensation is based on the tax treatment for applicable tax jurisdictions.\n(2) The tax impact of the Indegy acquisition in 2019 includes $6.3 million of current tax expense and $4.2 million of deferred tax expense related to the transfer of acquired intellectual property.\n(3) The tax impact of amortization of acquired intangible assets is not material.\n(4) Adjustment to reconcile GAAP net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, which excludes potentially dilutive shares, to non-GAAP earnings per share, which includes potentially dilutive shares.\n(5) In periods in which there is a non-GAAP net loss, basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding are the same, as potentially dilutive shares would be antidilutive.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from subscription arrangements for our software and cloud-based solutions, perpetual licenses, maintenance associated with perpetual licenses and professional services.\nOur subscription arrangements generally have annual or multi-year contractual terms to use our software or cloud-based solutions, including ongoing software updates during the contractual period. Revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term given the critical utility provided by the ongoing updates that are released throughout the contract period.\nOur perpetual licenses are generally sold with one or more years of maintenance, which includes ongoing software updates. Given the critical utility provided by the ongoing software updates and updated ability to identify network vulnerabilities included in maintenance, we combine the perpetual license and the maintenance into a single performance obligation. Perpetual license arrangements generally contain a material right related to the customer\u2019s ability to renew maintenance at a price that is less than the initial license fee. We apply a practical alternative to allocating a portion of the transaction price to the material right performance obligation and estimate a hypothetical transaction price which includes fees for expected maintenance renewals based on the estimated economic life of perpetual license contracts. We allocate the transaction price between the cybersecurity subscription provided in the initial contract and the material right related to expected contract renewals based on the hypothetical transaction price. We recognize the amount allocated to the combined license and maintenance performance obligation over the initial contractual period, which is generally one year. We recognize the amount allocated to the material right over the expected maintenance renewal period, which begins at the end of the initial contractual term and is generally four years. We have estimated the five-year economic life of perpetual license contracts based on historical contract attrition, expected renewal periods, the lifecycle of our technology and other factors. This estimate may change over time.\nProfessional services and other revenue is primarily comprised of advisory services and training related to the deployment and optimization of our products. These services do not result in significant customization of our products. Professional services and other revenue is recognized as the services are performed.\nWe have historically experienced, and expect in the future to experience, seasonality in entering into agreements with customers. We typically enter into a significantly higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the third and fourth quarters of the year. The increase in customer agreements in the third quarter is primarily attributable to U.S. government and related agencies, and the increase in the fourth quarter is primarily attributable to large enterprise account buying patterns typical in the software industry. The ratable nature of our subscription revenue makes this seasonality less apparent in our overall financial results.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nCost of revenue includes personnel costs related to our technical support group that provides assistance to customers, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes, stock-based compensation and any severance. Cost of revenue also includes cloud infrastructure costs, the costs related to professional services and training, depreciation, amortization of acquired and developed technology and allocated overhead costs, which consist of information technology and facilities.\nWe intend to continue to invest additional resources in our cloud-based platform and customer support team as we grow our business. The level and timing of investment in these areas could affect our cost of revenue in the future.\nGross profit, or revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, have been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the timing of our acquisition of new customers and our renewals of and follow-on sales to existing customers, the costs associated with operating our cloud-based platform, the extent to which we expand our customer support team and the extent to which we can increase the efficiency of our technology and infrastructure through technological improvements.\nWe expect our gross profit to increase in absolute dollars but our gross margin to decrease over time, as we expect revenue from our cloud-based subscriptions to increase as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin could fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of all of these factors, particularly as it relates to cloud infrastructure costs.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes, stock-based compensation and any severance. Operating expenses also include depreciation and amortization as well as allocated overhead costs, including IT and facilities costs.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense consists of personnel costs, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel and entertainment, expenses for conferences and events and allocated overhead costs. We capitalize sales commissions, including related fringe benefit costs, and recognize the expense over an estimated period of benefit, which ranges between three and four years for subscription arrangements and five years for perpetual license arrangements. Sales commissions on contract renewals are capitalized and amortized ratably over the contract term, with the exception of contracts with renewal periods that are one year or less, in which case the incremental costs are expensed as incurred. Sales commissions on professional services arrangements are expensed as incurred as the contractual periods of these arrangements are generally less than one year.\nWe intend to continue to make investments in our sales and marketing teams to grow revenue, further penetrate the market and expand our global customer base. We expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars annually and to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future. However, as our revenue increases, we expect our sales and marketing expense to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term. Our sales and marketing expense may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses, including sales commissions, which may fluctuate depending on the mix of sales and related expense recognition.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expense consists of personnel costs, software used to develop our products, travel and entertainment, consulting and professional fees for third-party development resources as well as allocated overhead. Our research and development expense supports our efforts to continue to add capabilities to our existing products and enable the continued detection of new network vulnerabilities.\nWe expect our research and development expense to continue to increase annually in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development efforts to enhance the functionality of our cloud-based platform. However, we expect our research and development expense to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our research and development expense may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists of personnel costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and administrative departments. Additional expenses include travel and entertainment, professional fees, insurance, allocated overhead, and acquisition-related costs.\nWe expect our general and administrative expense to continue to increase annually in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, insurance and investor relations as a public company. However, we expect our general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses.\nInterest Income, Net\nInterest income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and interest expense in connection with our credit facility, including unused and letter of credit fees.\nOther Expense, Net\nOther expense, net consists primarily of foreign currency remeasurement and transaction gains and losses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business and the related withholding taxes on sales with customers. We have recorded deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance has been provided, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future as it is more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets may not be realized based on our history of losses.

The proceeds of our Series A and Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock financings were used to repurchase shares of capital stock from former stockholders. Upon the completion of our IPO in July 2018, we received net proceeds of $264.6 million. We have generated significant operating losses, as reflected by our accumulated deficit of $607.9 million at December 31, 2020.\nWe typically invoice our customers annually in advance and, to a lesser extent, multi-year in advance. Therefore, a substantial source of our cash is from such prepayments, which are included on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue consists primarily of the unearned portion of billed fees for our subscriptions and perpetual licenses, which is subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. At December 31, 2020, we had deferred revenue of $434.5 million, of which $328.8 million was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nOur principal uses of cash in recent periods have been funding our operations, expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development activities, investments in infrastructure, including the build-out of our new headquarters, and acquiring complementary businesses and technology. We expect to continue incurring operating losses in the near term. Even though we generated positive cash flows from operations and free cash flow in 2020, we may not be able to sustain these cash flows in the near term. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of spending to support further infrastructure and research and development efforts, the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in new and existing office spaces, the expansion of sales and marketing and international operating activities, the timing of our introduction of new product capabilities and enhancements of our platform and the continuing market acceptance of our platform. In addition, on February 10, 2021, we announced our agreement to acquire Alsid SAS, a leader in active directory security, for a total purchase price of $98 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The acquisition is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2021, subject to regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business and operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, the duration and effect of business disruptions, the ultimate effectiveness of the travel restrictions, quarantines, social\ndistancing requirements and business closures in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease, and the availability, timing and effectiveness of a vaccine, both domestically and globally. We also do not yet know the full extent of potential impacts on our business and operations, or those of our partners and customers, or the global economy as a whole. Accordingly, the current results and financial conditions discussed herein may not be indicative of our future operating results and trends. See the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nWe may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek equity or debt financing. In the event that financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, or if we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities because we lack sufficient capital, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nCredit Facility\nIn July 2020, we entered into a new $45.0 million senior secured credit facility, or the 2020 Credit Facility, with Silicon Valley Bank in connection with the expiration of our $25.0 million revolving credit facility, or the 2017 Credit Facility. The 2020 Credit Facility bears interest at either LIBOR plus 2%, with a 1% LIBOR floor, or the base rate plus 1%, and terminates on July 24, 2022. A commitment fee of 0.35% per annum is payable quarterly in arrears based on the unused portion. The obligations under 2020 Credit Facility are secured by a lien on our tangible and intangible property except intellectual property and certain subsidiaries and by a pledge of all of the equity interests of our material direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and 65% of each class of capital stock of any material first-tier foreign subsidiaries, subject to limited exceptions. The 2020 Credit Facility includes a $45.0 million uncommitted expansion, as well as a $10.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a swingline sub-facility of up to $10.0 million, and has a financial covenant requiring a minimum consolidated quick ratio of at least 1.5:1.0 on the last day of each quarter.\nIn 2020 and 2019, there were no amounts outstanding under our 2020 Credit Facility or, prior to its expiration, the 2017 Credit Facility. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the financial covenant and our borrowing capacity was reduced by $5.5 million related to standby letters of credit. We do not currently intend to draw on the 2020 Credit Facility.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 64,232 $ (10,744) $ (2,559)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 4,079 (113,050) (123,221)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n36,403 34,161 264,749\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n(916) (1,080) (1,063)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 103,798 $ (90,713) $ 137,906\nOperating Activities\nIn 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $64.2 million, which primarily consisted of our $42.7 million net loss, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense of $59.6 million and depreciation and amortization of $10.6 million, as well as a net cash inflow of $35.5 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $71.4 million increase in deferred revenue primarily due to increased subscription sales, as a majority of our customers are invoiced in advance, and a $8.9 million increase in operating lease liabilities due to $14.2 million of proceeds in lease incentives net of operating lease payments, partially offset by a $20.0 million increase in accounts receivable, an increase of approximately $17 million in accelerated payments for cloud software subscriptions, insurance and rent, and a $6.6 million increase in deferred commissions.\nIn 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $10.7 million, which primarily consisted of our $99.0 million net loss, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense of $41.6 million and depreciation and amortization of $6.9 million, as well as a net cash inflow of $36.3 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $72.8 million increase in deferred revenue, primarily due to increased subscription sales, as a majority of our customers are invoiced in advance, partially offset by a $25.9 million increase in accounts receivable and a $12.8 million increase in deferred commissions.\nIn 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $2.6 million, which primarily consisted of our $73.5 million net loss, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense of $22.9 million and depreciation and amortization of $6.2 million, as well as a net cash inflow of $41.4 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. The net inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $64.1 million in deferred revenue, primarily due to increased subscription sales as a majority of our customers are invoiced in advance, partially offset by a $17.4 million increase in accounts receivable.\nInvesting Activities\nFrom 2019 to 2020, cash flows from investing activities increased by $117.1 million, primarily due to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $74.6 million and an increase in our sales, net of purchases, of investments of $42.1 million.\nFrom 2018 to 2019, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $10.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in our purchases, net of sales, of short-term investments of $100.0 million, partially offset by cash paid for acquisitions of $74.9 million and capital expenditures for our new corporate headquarters of $11.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nFrom 2019 to 2020, net cash provided by financing activities increased by $2.2 million, primarily due to proceeds from a loan agreement of $2.0 million and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $2.7 million, which was partially offset by a decrease in stock issued in connection with the employee stock purchase plan of $2.1 million.\nFrom 2018 to 2019, net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $230.6 million, primarily due to proceeds from our IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, of $268.5 million, less payments of offering costs related to our IPO of $3.9 million in 2018, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $19.0 million and stock issued in connection with the employee stock purchase plan of $15.1 million in 2019.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2020:\n(in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 - 3 years 3 - 5 years More than 5 years\nOperating lease commitments $ 79,478 $ 3,891 $ 15,761 $ 15,301 $ 44,525\nNon-cancellable purchase obligations 4,821 3,596 1,225 - -\nTotal contractual obligations $ 84,299 $ 7,487 $ 16,986 $ 15,301 $ 44,525\nNot included in the table above is $7.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits and $1.2 million of asset retirement obligations because the timing of future cash outflows is uncertain.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In recognizing revenue, we apply the following steps:\n\u2022Identify the contract with a customer\n\u2022Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022Determine the transaction price\n\u2022Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022Recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied\nIn situations where we enter into a contractual arrangement that includes non-standard terms and conditions, such as acceptance provisions and options to purchase additional products and services, as well as contract modifications, we apply judgment in identifying and assessing the impact on revenue recognition.\nWe generate revenue from subscription arrangements for our software and cloud-based solutions, perpetual licenses, maintenance associated with perpetual licenses and professional services and other revenue.\nSubscription Revenue\nOur subscription arrangements generally have annual or multi-year contractual terms and allow customers to use our software or cloud solutions, including ongoing software updates and the ability to identify the latest cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term given the critical utility provided by the ongoing updates that are released throughout the contract period.\nPerpetual License and Maintenance Revenue\nOur perpetual licenses are generally sold with one or more years of maintenance, which include ongoing software updates and the ongoing ability to identify the latest cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Given the critical utility provided by the ongoing software updates and updated ability to identify network vulnerabilities included in maintenance, we combine the perpetual license and the maintenance into a single performance obligation. Perpetual license arrangements generally contain a material right related to the customer\u2019s ability to renew maintenance at a price that is less than the initial license fee. We apply a practical alternative to allocating a portion of the transaction price to the material right performance obligation and estimate a hypothetical transaction price which includes fees for expected maintenance renewals based on the estimated economic life of the perpetual license contracts. We allocate the transaction price between the cybersecurity subscription provided in the initial contract and the material right related to expected contract renewals based on the hypothetical transaction price. We recognize the amount allocated to the combined license and maintenance performance obligation over the initial contractual period, which is generally one year. We recognize the amount allocated to the material right over the expected maintenance renewal period, which begins at the end of the initial contractual term and is generally four years. We have estimated the five-year economic life of perpetual license contracts based on historical contract attrition, expected renewal periods, the lifecycle of the our technology and other factors. While we believe that the estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.\nProfessional Services and Other Revenue\nProfessional services and other revenue is primarily comprised of advisory services and training related to the deployment and optimization of our products. These services do not result in significant customization of our products. Professional services and other revenue is recognized as the services are performed.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nIn cases where our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, the contract transaction price is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis. We typically determine standalone selling price based on observable selling prices of our products and services.\nVariable Consideration\nWe record revenue from sales at the net sales price, which is the transaction price, including estimates of variable consideration when applicable. Certain of our customers may be entitled to receive credits and in certain circumstances, refunds, if service level commitments are not met. We have not historically experienced significant incidents affecting the ability to meet these service level commitments and any estimated refunds related to these agreements have not been material.\nSales through our channel partner network of distributors and resellers are generally discounted as compared to the price that we would sell to an end user. Revenue for sales through our channel network, which is fixed, is recorded net of any distributor or reseller margin.\nDeferred Commissions\nSales commissions, including related incremental fringe benefit costs, are considered to be incremental costs of obtaining a contract, and therefore are deferred over an estimated period of benefit, which ranges between three and four years for subscription arrangements and five years for perpetual license arrangements. We have estimated the period of benefit based on the expected contract term including renewal periods, the lifecycle of our technology and other factors. Sales commissions on contract renewals are capitalized and amortized ratably over the contract term, with the exception of contracts with renewal periods that are one year or less, in which case the incremental costs are expensed as incurred. While we believe that the estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to our stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and purchase rights issued under our 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2018 ESPP, is calculated based on the fair value of the awards granted and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally two to four years. RSUs that include performance-based vesting conditions and are expensed using the accelerated attribution method. We account for forfeitures as they occur.\nEstimating the fair value of stock options and purchase rights under the 2018 ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires assumptions as to the fair value of our underlying common stock, the estimated term of the option, the risk free interest rates, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock and the expected dividend yield. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the option awards reflect our best estimates. If any of the assumptions change significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ significantly compared with the awards granted previously.\nThe assumptions and estimates are as follows:\n\u2022Fair Value of Common Stock. See \u201cValuations\u201d discussion below.\n\u2022Expected Term. This is the period of time that the options granted are expected to remain unexercised. We employ the simplified method to calculate the average expected term.\n\u2022Volatility. This is a measure of the amount by which a financial variable, such as a share price, has fluctuated (historical volatility) or is expected to fluctuate (expected volatility) during a period. We have identified several public entities of similar size, complexity and stage of development and estimate our volatility based on the volatility of the common stock of these companies. In 2021, we intend to use the volatility of Tenable stock when calculating the fair value of purchase rights under the 2018 ESPP.\n\u2022Risk-Free Interest Rate. This is the U.S. Treasury rate, having a term that most closely resembles the expected life of the stock option.\n\u2022Dividend Yield. We have not and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock.\nValuations\nFollowing our IPO, we use the market price of our common stock at the date of grant as the fair value. Prior to our IPO, the lack of an active public market for our common stock required our board of directors to exercise reasonable judgment and consider a number of factors in order to make the best estimate of fair value of our common stock, in accordance with the technical practice-aid issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid entitled Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Factors considered in connection with estimating the fair value of our common stock underlying our award of restricted stock and stock option awards when performing the fair value calculations with the Black Scholes option-pricing model included:\n\u2022The results of independent third-party valuations of our common stock\n\u2022Recent arm\u2019s length transactions involving the sale or transfer of our common stock\n\u2022The rights, preferences and privileges of our Series A and Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock\n\u2022Our historical financial results and future financial projections\n\u2022The market value of equity interests in substantially similar businesses, which equity interests can be valued through nondiscretionary, objective means\n\u2022The lack of marketability of our common stock\n\u2022The likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO given prevailing market conditions\n\u2022Industry outlook\n\u2022General economic outlook including economic growth, inflation and unemployment, interest rate environment and global economic trends\nAs described above, the exercise price of our stock option awards was determined by our board of directors, with input from management, taking into account the factors described above, using a combination of valuation methodologies with varying weighting applied to each methodology as of the grant date.\nApplication of these approaches involved the use of estimates, judgment and assumptions that were highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses and future cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies and the probability of possible future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the relationships between those assumptions would have impacted our valuations as of each valuation date and may have had a material impact on the valuation of our common stock.\nThe fair value of each stock option was estimated on the grant date based on the following assumptions:\nYear Ended December 31,\nExpected term (in years) 6.3\nExpected volatility 41.3% - 43.3%\nRisk-free interest rate 2.7% - 2.9%\nExpected dividend yield -\nExpected forfeiture rate -\nThe fair value of each 2018 ESPP purchase right was estimated on the offering or modification dates based on the following assumptions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nExpected term (in years) 0.5 - 2.0\n0.5 - 2.0\n0.6 - 2.1\nExpected volatility 41.6% - 60.1%\n34.4% - 44.6%\n31.9% - 33.5%\nRisk-free interest rate 0.1% - 0.9%\n1.5% - 2.5%\n2.3% - 2.7%\nExpected dividend yield - - -\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations by recognizing the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. The excess purchase consideration over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Estimates in valuing certain identifiable intangible assets require significant judgment and include, but are not limited to, expected long-term market growth, future expected operating expenses, costs of capital, and appropriate discount rates. Our estimate of fair value is based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, we may make adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with offsetting adjustments to goodwill. Any adjustments made after the measurement period will be reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill\nThe excess purchase consideration over the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. We perform our annual impairment assessment on October 1, or more frequently, when events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. We operate as one reporting unit and have elected to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Company as a whole is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative assessment includes an evaluation of relevant events and circumstances, including macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, our overall financial performance, and trends in the value of our common stock. During the periods presented, there were no indications of impairment and it was not more likely than not that goodwill was impaired.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal, state and local taxes in the United States as well as numerous international jurisdictions. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than the United States. Earnings generated by our international entities are related to transfer pricing requirements as applicable under local jurisdiction tax laws.\nWe record a provision for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have valuation allowances in all jurisdictions against deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities that will reverse and provide a source of taxable income. Our evaluation of valuation allowances could change in the future and the impact could have a material impact on our financial statements.\nWe recognize tax benefits from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. Interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions are classified as a component of income tax expense.\nIn December 2019, subsequent to our acquisition of Indegy Ltd. we transferred the acquired Indegy intellectual property from Israel to the U.S. and Ireland through an intercompany transaction. The sale of Indegy's intellectual property for tax purposes resulted in $6.3 million of current tax expense and $4.2 million of deferred tax expense in Israel. The valuation of the intellectual property for tax purposes required significant judgment and assumptions with respect to forecasted operating results and discount rates.\nDepending on the jurisdiction, distributions of earnings could be subject to withholding taxes at rates applicable to the distributing jurisdiction. As we intend to continue to reinvest the earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely, we have not provided for a U.S. income tax liability and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.",

Our Dynamic Authorization solution provides centralized, fine-grained control over access to sensitive identity and device data across use cases. This gives organizations a centralized, drag-and-drop administration portal to restrict internal and external applications from accessing specific identity attributes such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, billing addresses or the entire user profile. Data access policies can evaluate attributes and preferences of the profile being requested, data from other repositories and information about the application and user making the request. Our Dynamic Authorization solution enables enterprises to comply with a broad range of regulatory requirements, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) and others by restricting data that a user has not consented to share and denying access to personal information that applications and users do not need to perform their tasks. Our advanced Dynamic Authorization features include:\n\u25cf policies that can be updated in a centralized, drag-and-drop graphical user interface;\n\u25cf centrally enforce authorization so application teams do not have to modify their application code; and\n\u25cf policies that can evaluate numerous data sources including LDAP v3, MDM or other internal systems.\nRisk Management. Our Risk Management solution enables organizations to make smarter authentication decisions by using machine learning and analytics to detect malicious activity. Our solution continuously analyzes multiple risk signals to give organizations in-depth user behavior insights to understand the risk in giving a user access to a resource or application. This provides enterprises with the ability to make real-time authentication decisions in determining if a user can access a resource, require additional assurances through step-up authentication or is denied access. Our Risk Management solution enables organizations to create intelligence-based policies to apply the appropriate strong authentication for resources or provide trusted users with a passwordless experience. Our Risk Management features include:\n\u25cf user and entity behavior analytics (\u201cUEBA\u201d) to detect abnormalities in authentication behavior;\n\u25cf anonymous network detection to determine if a user is accessing resources from unknown VPNs, TOR and proxies;\n\u25cf IP reputation to check if an IP address is connected to previous suspicious activity;\n\u25cf impossible travel to calculate if time between user log-ons from different locations is logistically possible;\n\u25cf configure risk policies that aggregate multiple risk predictors to calculate a single risk score; and\n\u25cf risk dashboards to view reports on detected malicious activity in an organization.\nIdentity Verification. Our Identity Verification solution enables enterprises to allow their customers to securely and conveniently verify their identity during enrollment and registration. This provides organizations with an increased level of assurance in the identity of their customers during the onboarding process to prevent fraudulent account creation and activity. Our solution can be integrated into an organization\u2019s mobile application to prompt customers to provide a live face capture and to scan a government-issued ID using their mobile device. The customer\u2019s identity is verified using our solution by matching the live face capture to the image on the government ID and validating the identification document for authenticity. Our Identity Verification solution enables enterprises in regulated industries, such as financial services and insurance, to meet Know Your Customer (\u201cKYC\u201d) requirements by providing customers a method to prove their identity. Our advanced Identity Verification features include:\n\u25cf liveness detection to ensure the end-user is a real, live person;\n\u25cf government ID validation for authenticity;\n\u25cf support for a variety of identification documents, included passports and driver\u2019s licenses from around the world;\n\u25cf the capturing and maintaining of customer personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) only on user\u2019s mobile device in encrypted form; and\n\u25cf leveraging the customer\u2019s trusted mobile device to bypass scanning ID on future verification requests.\nAPI Intelligence. Our API Intelligence solution can apply AI and ML to continuously inspect, report and act on all API activity. Our solution is purpose-built to recognize and respond to attacks that are designed to exploit the unique vulnerabilities of individual APIs. These attacks often go undetected by traditional security tools, such as application firewalls and API gateways. Our advanced API Intelligence features include:\n\u25cf API traffic monitoring, visibility and security using AI and ML;\n\u25cf automated API discovery;\n\u25cf API deception and honeypot;\n\u25cf API threat detection and blocking; and\n\u25cf deployment in-line or to the side of API gateways.\nOur Technology\nOur technology has been developed to the highest standards for security, performance, scale and interoperability. Our platform is built on the following core tenets:\n\u25cf Open Standards. We pioneered open identity standards that reduce the cost and complexity of interoperability and integration between IT vendors and partners. We also participated in the creation of many of the Internet Engineering Task Force standards in the identity space and continue to support the evolution and creation of new standards.\n\u25cf Turnkey Integrations. We provide a broad range of out-of-the-box adapters for \u201cfirst-mile\u201d and \u201clast-mile\u201d integration to cloud and on-premise applications and other systems. For example, we integrate with major enterprise identity systems, such as Broadcom, IBM, Oracle and Microsoft, as well as environments and application platforms such as Apache, Java, IIS, NGINX and WebSphere. In addition, we provide an extensive set of SaaS and social identity connectors that provide full integration with API functions. For example, our ServiceNow integration leverages over 20 user attributes. We also have out-of-the-box integrations with a variety of cloud-based and on-premise data sources, adaptive authentication providers and security and intelligence service providers.\n\u25cf Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Our API Intelligence solution utilizes our proprietary AI/ML capabilities to continuously inspect, report and act on all API activity. We are in the process of leveraging and expanding these AI/ML capabilities across our broader platform to deliver Intelligent Identity security based on device, network, application and user behavior data instead of manual rules and policies. Our core identity and access management solutions provide the flexibility to be deployed with AI, ML and risk management capabilities that Ping Identity has developed, as well as to integrate with AI, ML and risk management capabilities licensed from third parties. Our platform\u2019s goal is to deliver password-less, zero-login capabilities to secure access and enhance user experience. See \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to our Business - We rely on software and services from other parties. Defects in or the loss of access to software or services from third parties could increase our costs and adversely affect the quality of our solutions.\u201d\n\u25cf Uptime and Availability. We provide critical uptime and offer advanced redundancy features such as off-line modes to ensure services are available even when internet connectivity is lost. Our multi-tenant cloud-based offering is hosted in multiple regions around the world for redundancy and continuity. Our maintenance windows do not require any downtime, and our platform offered 99.99% uptime across our customer base over the past 12 months.\n\u25cf Scalability and Performance. Our platform can scale to millions of identities and thousands of cloud and on-premise applications in a single deployment.\n\u25cf Self-service. Self-service is becoming increasingly important as IT and IAM teams with limited resources seek to provide centralized IAM to the entire enterprise. The ability for developers to directly integrate identity into their applications accelerates the adoption of identity within the enterprise.\n\u25cf Security by Design. We integrate security into all of our solutions. Our security analysts maintain the security of our solutions by monitoring core services, both corporate and customer-facing, for indications of attack or compromise. We partner with trusted third party security firms to perform full-scope assessments and additional architectural reviews of our solutions. We also engage with third-party audit firms to perform SOC2 Type II audits, and ISO 27001-2013 certification of our security program.\nSales and Marketing\nSales\nWe sell our solutions primarily through direct sales. We have a stratified direct sales organization that is organized by customer size and the type of solution and deployment. Within our sales organization, our strategic account executives focus on the largest and most complex enterprises primarily in the Fortune 1000, that typically purchase multiple products or deployment options. In the last two years, we have also built a sales team focused more intensely on the Global 3000, with account executives that target less complex enterprise customers that typically purchase a single capability or use case initially and then expand as the complexity of their requirements expand.\nOur direct sales are enhanced by collaboration with our channel partners in sourcing new leads, aiding in pre-sale processes such as proof of concepts, demos or requests for proposals and reselling our solutions to customers, as well as collaboration with our system integrators and technology partners. We also leverage a number of our channel partners and system integrators to provide the implementation services for some of our larger and more complex deployments, significantly increasing the time-to-value for our customers and maximizing the efficiency of our go-to-market efforts.\nMarketing\nWe focus our marketing strategy on building brand recognition through thought leadership and differentiated messaging that communicates the business value of our platform. Our efforts include content marketing, social media, SEO, events and public and analyst relations. We convert this brand awareness into our pipeline through campaigns that integrate digital, social, web and field marketing tactics aimed at adding new customers and cross-marketing our solutions into our existing customer base. We host user conferences, which in 2020 were conducted virtually around the globe, to tap into the power of our passionate customer base and our broader ecosystem. We also founded and host the leading identity industry conference called Identiverse. Identiverse is held annually and attendees include architects, IAM professionals, IT administrators, developers, security professionals and CISOs, as well as technology vendors, system integrators, industry analysts and thought leaders.\nOur Customers\nAt December 31, 2020, we had 1,411 customers. We have a highly satisfied customer base, as evidenced by our Net Promoter Score of 65 in 2020. We define a customer as a separate legal entity with an individual subscription agreement and include in our customer count entities which we have sold directly and entities that have purchased one or more solutions from a reseller. Our customer base is comprised of over 60% of the Fortune 100. As of December 31, 2020, our customer base included 13 of the 15 largest U.S. banks (measured by assets), 7 of the 9 largest healthcare companies (measured by revenue), 5 of the 7 largest North American retailers (measured by revenue), the 5 largest global aerospace companies (measured by revenue) and the 5 largest European auto manufacturers (measured by revenue). Our customer base is diversified, with no one customer or reseller accounting for more than 3% or 7% of our total revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nPartnerships and Strategic Relationships\nThe PingPartner Network is comprised of key partnerships across our solution provider and technology alliance programs. This global network delivers expertise, value-added services and technology that are critical to the success of our customers.\nSolution Provider Program\nWe have built strong relationships with channel partners, system integrators and technology partners that have allowed us to generate new business opportunities and enhance existing practices such as strategic planning, program management, architecture, design, implementation, ongoing change management and support.\nTechnology Alliance\nWe have built a broad ecosystem of over 100 technology partners. Our Technology Alliance Partner ecosystem spans the landscape of IAM and related technologies, giving our customers access to comprehensive, cross-application, integrated solutions. Our technology partners expand and extend the value of their solutions, and our solutions, by integrating their technology with the Ping Intelligent Identity Platform. Additionally, our partners provide us with complementary technology and sales and marketing collateral that help us to more effectively sell together.\nWe partner with Microsoft, and this partnership has led to key product integrations. Through our collaboration, customers can leverage our platform to connect to the Microsoft Azure or Office365 services and enjoy rapid deployments via our integrations. We also enable non-Microsoft applications and environments to be easily integrated into the Microsoft ecosystem. Lastly, our MFA solution works directly with Microsoft ADFS and AzureAD to provide enterprise-grade adaptive authentication to Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based offerings.\nWe also partner with AWS to provide provisioning and deployment of our solutions to our customers through this collaboration. We offer AWS single sign-on integration for a leading enterprise cloud experience. We also offer a hybrid deployment that can scale across AWS for enterprise applications.\nProfessional Services and Customer Support\nProfessional Services\nOur professional services organization helps customers architect, deploy, configure, extend and integrate our platform into their IT environments. We offer a variety of packaged and configured offerings and expert guidance that leverage our best practices and experience, all of which are available for our robust partner community to use or resell. We complement our professional services with formal instructor-led and web-based on-demand training courses.\nCustomer Support\nWe offer three tiers of support, each building on the previous tier to most closely align with a customer\u2019s requirements. Support is included for our cloud and on-premise offerings during the term of a customer\u2019s subscription. All support tiers offer maintenance releases, patches and access to our support services and portal. Our support portal offers customers documentation, how-to guides, videos and a community where our customers can ask questions and find answers. Our customer support organization includes experienced, trained personnel and engineering resources located around the world to provide 24x7x365 support for critical issues.\nResearch and Development\nInnovation is at the core of what we do. Approximately one-third of our employees are devoted to research and development. Our research and development efforts are focused on building industry leading solutions, addressing all primary use cases, enhancing deployment flexibility and providing seamless integration across cloud and on-premise applications. We believe that the ongoing and timely development of new solutions and features is imperative to maintaining our competitive position. We continue to invest in our solutions across our development centers in Denver, Colorado; Austin, Texas; Tel Aviv, Israel; Vancouver, Canada; and Bangalore, India.\nIntellectual Property\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on copyrights and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, employment agreements and proprietary information and invention assignment agreements, trademarks and patents to protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe control access to, and use of, our solutions and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology, and such risks may increase as we attempt to expand into jurisdictions where such rights are less easily enforced, or are more subject to reverse engineering or misappropriation due to local legal requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 34 issued United States patents and 16 patent applications pending in the United States relating to certain aspects of our technology. Our issued United States patents expire between December 14, 2031 and October 12, 2038. We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Any of our existing patents and any that are issued in the future may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. In addition, we have international operations and intend to continue to expand these operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.\nCompetition\nWe face competition from (1) legacy providers, (2) cloud-only providers and (3) homegrown solutions.\nLegacy providers include Broadcom, IBM and Oracle, among others. These providers generally designed their solutions when enterprise applications were monolithic and on-premise. Their solutions utilize proprietary architectures, which require customized features and integrations to scale. Today, these solutions have the reputation of being complex, costly and increasingly fragile. Thus, legacy providers often struggle to offer a single comprehensive solution that spans all IT environments, including cloud and on-premise.\nWe also compete with cloud-only providers, such as Okta and OneLogin, that primarily focus on the workforce use case. These providers have solutions that are historically geared towards small and medium-sized businesses that have IT infrastructures hosted entirely in the cloud. The vast majority of large enterprises do not have the ability to operate their businesses solely with cloud infrastructures, and thus require enterprise solutions that support complex hybrid IT environments and the wide variety of applications and workloads found in enterprise IT portfolios. Thus, a cloud-only IAM solution cannot deliver a single comprehensive solution that enterprises require to provide end-to-end coverage across their complex IT landscape.\nMicrosoft also competes in our market and has tied its identity services to both Azure and its Office365 offerings. However, we partner with Microsoft to provide SSO, security control and adaptive MFA where non-Microsoft environments require integration or independence is preferred. Microsoft\u2019s integration and interoperability with our solutions benefits enterprises while providing optionality and choice.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in the IAM market include: (1) the ability to address all primary use cases from one platform; (2) the ability to deploy in large, complex hybrid IT environments; (3) the ability to integrate easily with all applications (cloud and on-premise); (4) technology uptime, reliability, scalability and performance; (5) the ability to support open standards; and (6) customer, technology and platform support. We believe we compete favorably on these factors.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we employed 1,022 employees across six global regions including Australia, Canada, Europe, India, Israel and the U.S.\nWe recognize that our ability to attract, develop and retain talent is key to our success. We have high employment engagement and consider our relationship with employees very strong, with 93% of employees recommending us as a great place to work. We are proud of the consistent work ethic our employees displayed during 2020; we pivoted quickly and efficiently to a remote working environment because of the flexibility and resiliency of our committed employee base.\nAt Ping Identity, trust is core to who we are and what we do. We know that how we work together is just as important as what we accomplish. We believe that our customers, partners and employees are on the same team striving for the same goals, and the best teams rely on a foundation of trust. We treat all who enter the Ping Identity ecosystem with respect and honesty, and always keep our commitments.\nCorporate Information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 1001 17th Street, Suite 100, Denver, Colorado 80202.

    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the sections entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d We have omitted the financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Part II, Item 7 of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 4, 2020.\nOverview\nPing Identity is the Intelligent Identity solution for the enterprise. We enable companies to achieve Zero Trust identity-defined security and more personalized, streamlined user experiences. The Ping Intelligent Identity Platform provides customers, workforce and partners with secure, convenient access to their applications whether they are SaaS, mobile, in the cloud or on-premise. We leverage AI and ML to analyze device, network, application and user behavior data to make real-time authentication and security control decisions, enhancing the user experience. Our platform is designed to detect anomalies and automatically insert additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, only when necessary. We built our platform to meet the requirements of the most demanding enterprises, including over 60% of the Fortune 100. Our cloud-based platform has differentiated deployment flexibility to support multi-cloud and on-premise infrastructures to meet the diverse and demanding requirements of large enterprise customers. Our platform offers a comprehensive suite of turnkey integrations, and is able to scale to millions of identities and thousands of cloud and on-premise applications in a single deployment.\nThe Ping Intelligent Identity Platform can secure all primary identity use cases, including customer, workforce, partner and IoT. For example, enterprises can use our platform to enhance their customers\u2019 user experience by creating a single ID and login across web and mobile properties. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 45% of our subscription revenue was derived from the customer use case. Enterprises can also use our platform to provide their workforce and commercial partners with secure, seamless access from any device to the applications, data and APIs they need to be productive.\nThe Ping Intelligent Identity Platform is comprised of multiple solutions that can be purchased individually or integrated as a more complete set of solutions for the customer, workforce, partner or IoT use case: SSO, MFA, Access Security, Directory, Dynamic Authorization, Risk Management, Identity Verification and API Intelligence.\nOur offerings are predominately priced based on the solution, use case and number of identities. We sell our platform through subscription-based contracts, and substantially all of our customers pay annually in advance. We sell our solutions primarily through direct sales, which are enhanced by collaboration with our channel partners, resellers, system integrators and technology partners. This includes sourcing new leads, aiding in pre-sale processes (such as proof of concepts, demos or requests for proposals) and reselling our solutions to customers. We also leverage a number of our channel partners and system integrators to provide the implementation services for some of our larger and more complex deployments, significantly increasing the time-to-value for our customers and maximizing the efficiency of our go-to-market efforts.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThough the impact of rapidly changing market and economic conditions due to COVID-19 is uncertain, it continues to disrupt the business of our customers and partners and will continue to impact our business and consolidated results of operations and financial condition in the future. The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 outbreak is resulting in a global slowdown of economic activity with a corresponding decrease in demand for\ncertain goods and services, including possibly from our own customers, while also disrupting sales channels, marketing activities and supply chains for an unknown period of time. To add to the uncertainty, it is unclear when an economic recovery could start and what a recovery will look like after this unprecedented economic shutdown. We have endeavored to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees worldwide. For example, as of January 31, 2021, the majority of our employees are working remotely. While we have not incurred significant disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact on our business due to numerous uncertainties, including but not limited to, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, actions taken by governmental authorities, the impact to our customers and partners and other factors as described in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Specifically, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced overall strong engagement with enterprise customers as work-from-home and increased virtual customer engagement highlighted the need for modernization of their identity security infrastructure. However, given the economic uncertainty driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of these enterprise customers elected to phase-in their purchases of our solutions, resulting in smaller deal sizes and a reduction in our dollar-based net retention rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWhile we continued to see the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2020, the total effect of the COVID-19 pandemic will not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods and such effect is uncertain. In addition, our consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, establishing valuation allowances based on expected credit losses and the collectability of financial assets, determining useful lives for finite-lived assets, assessing the recoverability of long-lived assets, determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, determining the value of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, accounting for income taxes and related valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, valuing stock option awards and assessing the probability of the awards meeting vesting conditions, recognizing revenue, determining the amortization period for deferred commissions and assessing the accounting treatment for commitments and contingencies. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and makes estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from these estimates, including as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nWe believe that our future performance will depend on many factors, including the following:\nGenerate Additional Sales to Existing Customers\nAs part of our land and expand strategy, a customer journey often begins with the purchase of one of our solutions for one use case. Once customers realize the value of that solution, their spend with us expands by (i) adopting another identity use case, (ii) deploying additional solutions and solution packages and/or (iii) adding more identities over time.\nOur future revenue growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand our customers\u2019 use of our platform. Our ability to increase sales to existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solutions, competition, pricing, economic conditions and spending by customers on our solutions. We have adopted a customer success strategy and implemented processes across our customer base to drive revenue retention and expansion.\nIncrease the Size of our Customer Base\nWe believe there is significant opportunity to increase market adoption of our platform by new customers. Our SSO, Access Security and Directory solutions often replace legacy and homegrown systems. We also have significant greenfield opportunities with our MFA, Dynamic Authorization, API Intelligence solutions and the IoT use case. To increase our customer base, we plan to expand our sales force and channel partner network, both domestically and internationally, enhance our marketing efforts and target new buyers. For example, we have extended our cloud-based offering to target developers, who represent a new potential buyer for us. Over time, we believe sales to developers could increase the size of our customer base.\nMaintain our Technology Differentiation and Product Leadership\nThe Ping Intelligent Identity Platform is designed for large enterprises with complex, hybrid IT requirements. We have spent over a decade building a standards-based platform with turnkey integrations designed to ensure that large enterprises can easily and rapidly deploy our platform within their complex infrastructures. We intend to continue making investments in research and development to extend our platform and technology capabilities while also expanding our solutions to address new use cases.\nInvest for Growth\nWe believe IAM represents a large market opportunity, and we plan to invest in order to support further growth. During 2018, we accelerated investments in our business to expand our footprint within this large and growing market. Specifically, we invested in new cloud-based offerings to broaden the Ping Intelligent Identity Platform and the scope of our solutions to cover new identity security threats, such as APIs. We also invested in deploying our platform as a single tenant cloud-based offering, managed by us, to help extend the reach of our solutions within our customers\u2019 infrastructures, while providing them with the level of control and configuration they require. We have seen progress with these investments and expect to continue to invest in these areas. Additionally, we plan to invest in increased marketing efforts, expanding our sales force, and growing our network of channel partners, resellers, system integrators and technology partners. However, we are not expecting these investments to provide our business with meaningful increases to ARR growth in the immediate term as we expect natural purchasing cycles will affect the speed of market adoption.\nAdditionally, we have a large and growing international presence and intend to grow our customer base in various international regions by making investments in our sales team globally. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our international revenue was 26% of our total revenue. We expect international sales to be a meaningful revenue contributor in future periods.\nSeasonality\nGiven the purchasing patterns of our enterprise customers, we typically experience seasonality in terms of when we receive orders from our customers. Our customers often time their purchases and renewals of our solutions to coincide with their fiscal year end, which is typically June 30 or December 31. Because of these purchasing patterns, a greater percentage of our annual subscription revenue from term-based licenses, the revenue from which is recognized up front at the later of delivery or commencement of the license term, has come from our second and fourth quarters than from other quarters. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 26% and 28% of our annual revenue was in our second and fourth quarter, respectively. However, due to the economic environment resulting from COVID-19, we did not see our historical trends in seasonality continue for the year ended December 31, 2020, where 24% and 26% of our annual revenue was in our second and fourth quarter, respectively.\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to our GAAP financial information, we review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\nARR represents the annualized value of all subscription contracts as of the end of the period. ARR mitigates fluctuations due to seasonality, contract term and the sales mix of subscriptions for term-based licenses and SaaS. ARR only includes the annualized value of subscription contracts. ARR does not have any standardized meaning and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.\nThe table below sets forth our ARR as of the end of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nDecember 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nARR\n$\n259,090\n$\n224,888\n$\n34,202\n%\nDollar-Based Net Retention Rate\nTo further illustrate the land and expand economics of our customer relationships, we examine the rate at which our customers increase their subscriptions for our solutions. Our dollar-based net retention rate measures our ability to increase revenue across our existing customer base through expanded use of our platform, offset by customers whose subscription contracts with us are not renewed or renew at a lower amount.\nWe calculate our dollar-based net retention rate as of the end of a reporting period as follows:\n\u25cf Denominator. We measure ARR as of the last day of the prior reporting period.\n\u25cf Numerator. We measure ARR as of the last day of the current reporting period from customers with associated ARR as of the last day of the prior reporting period.\nThe quotient obtained from this calculation is our dollar-based net retention rate. Our dollar-based net retention rates were 108% and 115% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe our ability to cross-sell our new solutions to our installed base, particularly MFA and API Intelligence, will continue to support our high dollar-based net retention rate.\nLarge Customers\nWe believe that our ability to increase the number of customers on our platform, particularly the number of customers with greater than ARR of $1,000,000 and ARR of $250,000, demonstrates our focus on the large enterprise market and our penetration within those enterprises. Increasing awareness of our platform, further developing our sales and marketing expertise and channel partner ecosystem, and continuing to build solutions that address the unique identity needs of large enterprises have increased our number of large customers across industries. We believe there are significant upsell and cross-sell opportunities within our customer base by expanding the number of use cases, adding additional identities and selling new solutions.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had 51 customers with greater than $1,000,000 in ARR, an increase of 34% from 38 customers at December 31, 2019. Additionally, our customers with ARR over $250,000 increased from 232 at December 31, 2019 to 260 at December 31, 2020, representing a growth rate of 12%.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP\nfinancial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow is a supplemental measure of liquidity that is not made under GAAP and that does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs.\nWe use Free Cash Flow as one measure of the liquidity of our business. We believe that Free Cash Flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our core operations that, after the purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs, can be used for strategic initiatives, including investing in our business and selectively pursuing acquisitions and strategic investments. We further believe that historical and future trends in Free Cash Flow, even if negative, provide useful information about the amount of cash generated (or consumed) by our operating activities that is available (or is not available) to be used for strategic initiatives. For example, if Free Cash Flow is negative, we may need to access cash reserves or other sources of capital to invest in strategic initiatives. We also believe that the use of Free Cash Flow enables us to more effectively evaluate our liquidity period-over-period and relative to our competitors.\nA reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n22,375\n$\n5,795\n$\n22,886\nLess:\nPurchases of property and equipment\n(2,595)\n(8,696)\n(3,437)\nCapitalized software development costs\n(13,255)\n(10,460)\n(6,310)\nFree Cash Flow\n$\n6,525\n$\n(13,361)\n$\n13,139\nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(48,320)\n$\n(19,756)\n$\n(26,661)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n$\n103,009\n$\n(2,020)\n$\n67,102\nCash paid for interest\n$\n2,263\n$\n12,169\n$\n13,598\nFree Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Free Cash Flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period. Because of these limitations, Free Cash Flow should not be considered as a replacement for cash flow from operations, as determined by GAAP, or as a measure of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes.\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit is a supplemental measure of operating performance that is not made under GAAP and that does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to gross profit, as determined by GAAP. We define Non-GAAP Gross Profit as gross profit, adjusted for stock-based compensation expense and certain amortization expense of acquired intangible assets and software developed for internal use.\nWe use Non-GAAP Gross Profit to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. We believe that Non-GAAP Gross Profit is a useful measure to us and to our investors because it provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and between fiscal periods, as the metric generally eliminates the effects of the variability of amortization of acquired intangibles and internal-use software and stock-based compensation expense from period to period, which may fluctuate for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. We believe that the use of this measure enables us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period and relative to our competitors.\nA reconciliation of Non-GAAP Gross Profit to gross profit, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nGross profit\n$\n175,378\n$\n187,194\n$\n156,951\nAmortization expense\n20,269\n16,338\n14,396\nStock-based compensation expense\n1,072\n-\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit\n$\n196,719\n$\n203,753\n$\n171,347\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, Non-GAAP Gross Profit should not be considered as a replacement for gross profit, as determined by GAAP, or as a measure of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe recognize revenue under ASC 606 when our customer obtains control of goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nWe derive revenue primarily from sales of subscriptions for our solutions to new and existing customers and, to a lesser extent, sales of professional services.\nSubscription. Subscription revenue includes subscription term-based license revenue for solutions deployed on-premise within the customer\u2019s IT infrastructure or in a third-party cloud of their choice, subscription support and maintenance revenue from such deployments, and SaaS subscriptions, which give customers the right to access our SaaS-based solutions. We typically invoice subscription fees annually in advance. Subscription term-based license revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the software, which occurs at delivery or when the license term commences, if later. All of our support and maintenance revenue and revenue from SaaS subscriptions is recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, 59% and 66%, respectively, of our revenue was from subscription term-based licenses. We expect that a majority of our revenue will be from subscription term-based licenses for the foreseeable future. Changes in period-over-period subscription revenue growth are primarily impacted by the following factors:\n\u25cf the type of new and renewed subscriptions (i.e., term-based or SaaS); and\n\u25cf the duration of new and renewed term-based subscriptions.\nWhile the number of new and increased subscriptions during a period impacts our subscription revenue growth, the type and duration of those subscriptions has a significantly greater impact on the amount and timing of\nrevenue recognized in a period. Subscription revenue from term-based licenses is recognized at the beginning of the subscription term, while subscription revenue from SaaS and support and maintenance is recognized ratably over the subscription term. As a result, our revenue may fluctuate due to the timing of term-based licensing transactions. In addition, keeping other factors constant, when the percentage of subscription term-based licenses to total subscriptions sold or renewed in a period increases relative to the prior period, revenue growth will increase. Conversely, when the percentage of subscription SaaS and support and maintenance to total subscriptions sold or renewed in a period increases, revenue growth will generally decrease. Additionally, a multi-year subscription term-based license will generally result in greater revenue recognition up front relative to a one-year subscription term-based license. Therefore, keeping other factors constant, revenue growth will also trend higher in a period where the percentage of multi-year subscription term-based licenses to total subscription term-based licenses increases.\nProfessional Services and Other. Professional services and other revenue consists primarily of fees from professional services provided to our customers and partners to configure and optimize the use of our solutions, as well as training services related to the configuration and operation of our solutions. Our professional services are generally priced on a time and materials basis, which is generally invoiced monthly and for which revenue is recognized as the services are performed. Revenue from our training services and sponsorship fees is recognized on the date the services are complete. Over time, we expect our professional services revenue to remain relatively stable as a percentage of total revenue.\nCost of Revenue\nSubscription. Subscription cost of revenue consists primarily of employee compensation costs for employees associated with supporting our subscription arrangements and certain third-party expenses. Employee compensation and related costs include cash compensation and benefits to employees, stock-based compensation, costs of third-party contractors and associated overhead costs. Third-party expenses consist of cloud infrastructure costs and other expenses directly associated with our customer support. We expect our subscription cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars to the extent our subscription revenue increases.\nProfessional Services and Other. Professional services and other cost of revenue consists primarily of employee compensation costs directly associated with delivery of professional services and training, including stock-based compensation, costs of third-party contractors, and facility rental charges and other associated overhead costs. We expect our professional services and other cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars relative to the growth of our business.\nAmortization Expense. Amortization expense consists of amortization of developed technology and internal-use software.\nLong-Term Incentive Plan. If the long-term incentive plan (\u201cLTIP\u201d) awards are considered probable of meeting vesting requirements in the three months ending March 31, 2021, it may result in incremental compensation expense between $1.3 million to $1.8 million being recognized in the three months ending March 31, 2021, and between $0.4 million to $0.8 million being recognized ratably over the remaining estimated vesting period.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and amortization. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes and stock-based compensation expense.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs, sales commissions, costs of general marketing and promotional activities, travel-related expenses and allocated overhead. Certain sales commissions earned by our sales force on subscription contracts are deferred and amortized over the period of benefit, which is generally four years. We expect to continue to invest in our sales force domestically and internationally, as well as in our channel relationships. We expect our sales and\nmarketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and continue to be our largest operating expense category for the foreseeable future.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs, allocated overhead and software and maintenance expenses. We will continue to invest in innovation and offer our customers new solutions to enhance our existing platform and expect such investment to increase on an absolute dollar basis as our business grows.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs for corporate personnel, such as those in our executive, human resource, legal, facilities, accounting and finance, information security and information technology departments. In addition, general and administrative expenses include third-party professional fees, as well as all other supporting corporate expenses not allocated to other departments. General and administrative expense also includes acquisition-related expenses, which primarily consist of third-party expenses related to business acquisitions, such as professional services and legal fees.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis as our business grows. Also, we expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of continuing to operate as a public company, including costs related to maintaining the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight, costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations and professional services.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of our fixed assets and amortization of finite-lived acquired intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names and non-compete agreements.\nLong-Term Incentive Plan and Stock Option Awards. If the stock option awards subject to performance and market conditions are considered probable of meeting vesting requirements in the three months ending March 31, 2021, it may result in incremental stock-based compensation expense of approximately $6.3 million being recognized in the three months ending March 31, 2021, and approximately $1.3 million being recognized ratably over the remaining estimated vesting period. Additionally, if the LTIP awards are considered probable of meeting vesting requirements in the three months ending March 31, 2021, it may result in incremental compensation expense between $16.3 million to $17.3 million being recognized in the three months ending March 31, 2021, and between $5.3 million to $6.3 million being recognized ratably over the remaining estimated vesting period.\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities as well as the amortization of associated deferred financing costs. See \u201c- Liquidity and Capital Resources - Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\u201d\nOther Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net primarily consists of gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, interest income and other income (expense). As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies has increased, and we expect this to continue.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to U.S. federal and state income taxes and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nRevenue:\nSubscription\n$\n224,131\n$\n225,345\n$\n184,991\nProfessional services and other\n19,458\n17,553\n16,571\nTotal revenue\n243,589\n242,898\n201,562\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription (exclusive of amortization shown below)(1)\n30,797\n24,044\n17,512\nProfessional services and other (exclusive of amortization shown below)(1)\n17,145\n15,322\n12,703\nAmortization expense\n20,269\n16,338\n14,396\nTotal cost of revenue\n68,211\n55,704\n44,611\nGross profit\n175,378\n187,194\n156,951\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing(1)\n88,910\n78,889\n60,140\nResearch and development(1)\n48,934\n46,016\n36,229\nGeneral and administrative(1)\n47,198\n38,293\n28,355\nDepreciation and amortization\n16,997\n16,639\n16,341\nTotal operating expenses\n202,039\n179,837\n141,065\nIncome (loss) from operations\n(26,661)\n7,357\n15,886\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense\n(2,433)\n(12,914)\n(15,837)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n-\n(4,532)\n(9,785)\nOther income (expense), net\n2,947\n(335)\nTotal other income (expense)\n(17,083)\n(25,957)\nLoss before income taxes\n(26,147)\n(9,726)\n(10,071)\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n14,256\n8,222\n(3,375)\nNet loss\n$\n(11,891)\n$\n(1,504)\n$\n(13,446)\n______________________\n(1)\nIncludes stock-based compensation as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nSubscription cost of revenue\n$\n$\n$\n-\nProfessional services and other cost of revenue\n-\nSales and marketing\n4,467\n1,407\nResearch and development\n5,294\n1,364\nGeneral and administrative\n5,791\n3,340\n1,780\nTotal\n$\n16,624\n$\n6,332\n$\n2,848\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\nRevenue:\nSubscription\n%\n%\n%\nProfessional services and other\nTotal revenue\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription (exclusive of amortization shown below)\nProfessional services and other (exclusive of amortization shown below)\nAmortization expense\nTotal cost of revenue\nGross profit\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing\nResearch and development\nGeneral and administrative\nDepreciation and amortization\nTotal operating expenses\nIncome (loss) from operations\n(11)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense\n(1)\n(5)\n(8)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n-\n(2)\n(5)\nOther income (expense), net\n-\n-\nTotal other income (expense)\n-\n(7)\n(13)\nLoss before income taxes\n(11)\n(4)\n(5)\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n(2)\nNet loss\n(5)\n%\n(1)\n%\n(7)\n%\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenue\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenue:\nSubscription\n$\n224,131\n$\n225,345\n$\n(1,214)\n(1)\n%\nProfessional services and other\n19,458\n17,553\n1,905\nTotal revenue\n$\n243,589\n$\n242,898\n$\n-\n%\nTotal revenue increased by $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The revenue growth was attributable to an increase in professional services and other revenue of $1.9 million due to an increase in the provisioning of implementation and consulting services. This was partially offset by a decrease in subscription revenue of $1.2 million, discussed further below.\nThe table below sets forth the components of subscription revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nSubscription:\nMulti-year subscription term-based licenses\n$\n86,578\n$\n113,151\n$\n(26,573)\n(23)\n%\n1-year subscription term-based licenses\n57,966\n48,255\n9,711\nSubscription term-based licenses\n144,544\n161,406\n(16,862)\n(10)\nSubscription SaaS and maintenance and support\n79,587\n63,939\n15,648\nTotal subscription revenue\n$\n224,131\n$\n225,345\n$\n(1,214)\n(1)\n%\nSubscription revenue decreased 1%, or $1.2 million, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to strong growth in our SaaS solutions resulting in a decrease in up-front term-based license revenue and shorter subscription terms from customers electing to phase-in their purchases of our solutions in light of the sustained economic environment and associated uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. Remaining changes in subscription revenue were due to the changes in subscription type and duration, described further below.\nChange in subscription type. The following table sets forth the components of subscription revenue expressed as a percentage of total subscription revenue:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n%\nSubscription term-based licenses\n%\n%\n(8)\n%\nSubscription SaaS and maintenance and support\nTotal subscription revenue\n%\n%\nSubscription term-based license revenue as a percentage of subscription revenue decreased from 72% in the year ended December 31, 2019 to 64% in the year ended December 31, 2020. Subscription SaaS and support and maintenance as a percentage of total subscription revenue increased from 28% in the year ended December 31, 2019 to 36% in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in subscription SaaS and support and maintenance revenue as a percentage of total subscription revenue was primarily driven by the increased adoption of our SaaS solutions, which resulted in greater deferral of revenue from subscriptions entered into or renewed in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. We expect subscription SaaS and support and maintenance to continue to increase as a percentage of total subscription revenue in future periods as adoption of our SaaS solutions increases, resulting in greater deferral of revenue in the period in which the subscription is contracted.\nChange in term-based subscription duration. The following table sets forth the components of subscription term-based licenses expressed as a percentage of total subscription term-based license revenue:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n%\nMulti-year subscription term-based licenses\n%\n%\n(10)\n%\n1-year subscription term-based licenses\nTotal subscription term-based licenses\n%\n%\nMulti-year subscription term-based license revenue as a percentage of total subscription term-based license revenue decreased from 70% in the year ended December 31, 2019 to 60% in the year ended December 31, 2020. This resulted in less upfront revenue recognition from subscriptions entered into or renewed during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription (exclusive of amortization shown below)\n$\n30,797\n$\n24,044\n$\n6,753\n%\nProfessional services and other (exclusive of amortization shown below)\n17,145\n15,322\n1,823\nAmortization expense\n20,269\n16,338\n3,931\nTotal cost of revenue\n$\n68,211\n$\n55,704\n$\n12,507\n%\nSubscription cost of revenue increased by $6.8 million, or 28%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. $4.2 million of the increase was compensation related and primarily attributable to an increase in headcount to support the continued growth of our subscription SaaS offerings and ongoing maintenance and support for our expanding customer base. $2.6 million of the increase was attributable to our increased hosting costs largely associated with the increased adoption of our solutions.\nProfessional services and other cost of revenue increased by $1.8 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase related to a $1.1 million increase in consulting costs, partially to aid in the development of our certification programs, while $0.8 million was compensation related and primarily attributable to an increase in headcount to support growth of our business as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense due to an increase in the issuance of RSUs granted in 2020 compared to 2019. These increases were offset by a $0.8 million decrease in travel costs due to a reduction in travel in 2020 because of COVID-19. The remaining portion of the increase was primarily attributable to allocated overhead.\nAmortization expense increased by $3.9 million, or 24%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The year-over-year increase was attributable primarily to an increase in the amortization of our capitalized software as well as an increase in the amortization of developed technology resulting from our acquisitions of ShoCard and Symphonic in March and October of 2020, respectively, as further described in Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nSales and marketing\n$\n88,910\n$\n78,889\n$\n10,021\n%\nResearch and development\n48,934\n46,016\n2,918\nGeneral and administrative\n47,198\n38,293\n8,905\nDepreciation and amortization\n16,997\n16,639\nTotal operating expenses\n$\n202,039\n$\n179,837\n$\n22,202\n%\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $10.0 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. $11.0 million of the increase was related to compensation as a result of an increase in headcount related to the expansion of our sales force and our marketing department, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense resulting from an increase in the issuance of RSUs granted in 2020 compared to 2019. Additionally, promotional expenses increased by $1.1 million due to additional spend around branding and awareness campaigns. These increases were offset by a $3.7 million decrease in travel costs due to a reduction in travel in 2020 because of COVID-19. The remaining increases were related to consulting costs and allocated overhead.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses increased by $2.9 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. $8.3 million was compensation related and primarily the result of an increase in headcount to enhance and expand our solutions.\nCompensation-related expenses also increased due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense resulting from an increase in the issuance of equity awards granted in 2020 compared to 2019, including the liability-classified awards that were issued in conjunction with the ShoCard and Symphonic acquisitions as further described in Notes 7 and 12 of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These increases were offset by a decrease of $2.8 million attributable to contingent compensation and retention expense related to our acquisition of Elastic Beam that was paid in full by April 2020. The increase in research and development expense was also offset by an increase of $3.6 million related to employee costs that were capitalized as software development costs in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. The remaining increase was primarily the result of an increase in allocated overhead.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased by $8.9 million, or 23%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. $7.5 million of the increase was attributable to an increase in administrative expenses related to operating as a public company for the full year of 2020 as compared to 2019, where we were only public for a portion of the year starting in September of 2019, as well as incremental costs related to our follow-on offerings. $1.7 million of the increase was attributable to acquisition-related expenses that we incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 for our acquisitions of ShoCard and Symphonic. Additionally, $1.1 million of the increase was compensation-related and primarily the result of an increase in stock-based compensation expense due to an increase in the issuance of RSUs granted in 2020 compared to 2019. These increases were partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in travel costs related to a reduction in travel because of COVID-19 and decreases in partner and consulting costs and allocated overhead.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense slightly increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as the Company expanded its office sites in early 2020 to accommodate its growing headcount, which increased the depreciation of the associated leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures.\nOther Income (Expense)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nInterest expense\n$\n(2,433)\n$\n(12,914)\n$\n10,481\n(81)\n%\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n-\n(4,532)\n4,532\n(100)\nOther income (expense), net\n2,947\n2,584\nTotal other income (expense)\n$\n$\n(17,083)\n$\n17,597\n(103)\n%\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $10.5 million, or 81%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable primarily to the refinancing of our debt in December 2019 as described in Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The refinancing also attributed to the period-over-period decrease in the weighted average interest rate, from 6.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 1.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $4.5 million. $3.6 million of the loss related to the write off of a portion of our deferred debt issuance costs in conjunction with the repayment of $196.4 million of outstanding principal on our 2018 Term Loan Facility using the proceeds from our IPO. The remaining $0.9 million of the loss related to the refinancing of our debt in December 2019. There was no similar loss during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOther Income (Expense), Net. Other income (expense), net increased by $2.6 million, or 712%, from other income of $0.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to other income of $2.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was attributable primarily to a change in the amount of foreign currency gains and losses, from a loss of $0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a gain of $2.7\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in interest income recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nBenefit (Provision) for Income Taxes\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(dollars in thousands)\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n$\n14,256\n$\n8,222\n$\n6,034\n%\nOur benefit for income taxes was $14.3 million and $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in our benefit for income taxes in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by an increase in our loss before income taxes. An additional $4.7 million of the increase in our net benefit for income taxes related to an increase in deductible stock-based compensation in 2020 compared to 2019, which we expect will continue to provide a benefit in future periods.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nAs of December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling $145.7 million, which were held for working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2020, our cash equivalents were comprised of money market funds. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our positive cash flows from operations have enabled us to make continued investments in supporting the growth of our business. We expect that our operating cash flows, in addition to our cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to continue to make such investments in the future. We expect our operating cash flows to further improve as we increase our operational efficiency and experience economies of scale.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through cash received from operations and proceeds from our debt and equity financings. On March 30, 2020, we drew down on the remaining $97.8 million available for borrowing under our 2019 Revolving Credit Facility (described further below). Given the uncertainty in the global economy as result of the COVID-19 pandemic and out of an abundance of caution, we elected to draw down the remaining available balance to further strengthen our cash position and maintain flexibility. If needed, the proceeds will be available for working capital and general corporate purposes, subject to compliance with the 2019 Credit Agreement. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, our 2019 Revolving Credit Facility and cash provided by sales of our solutions and services will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. We also believe that these financial resources will continue to allow us to manage the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations for the foreseeable future, including mitigating potential reductions in revenue and delays in payments from our customers and partners. Our future capital requirements will depend on several factors, including but not limited to our obligation to repay any amounts outstanding under our 2019 Credit Facilities, our subscription growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced solutions and the continuing market adoption of our platform. In the future, we may enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights.\nWe may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies, this could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations.\nA majority of our customers pay in advance for annual subscriptions, a portion of which is recorded as deferred revenue. Deferred revenue consists of the unearned portion of billed fees for our subscriptions, which is later recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. As of December 31, 2020, we had\ndeferred revenue of $52.4 million, of which $49.2 million was recorded as a current liability and is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nOn December 12, 2019, in connection with the refinancing of our 2018 Credit Facilities, we entered into the 2019 Credit Agreement providing for the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility with an initial $150.0 million in commitments for revolving loans, which amount may be increased or decreased under specific circumstances, with a $15.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a $50.0 million alternative currency sublimit. In addition, the 2019 Credit Agreement provides for the ability of Ping Identity Corporation to request incremental term loan facilities, in a minimum amount of $10 million for each facility, if, among other things, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement), calculated giving pro forma effect to the requested term loan facility, is no greater than 3.50 to 1.00.\nThe interest rates applicable to revolving borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement are, at the borrower\u2019s option, either (i) a base rate, which is equal to the greater of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5 of 1% and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one month Interest Period (each term as defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement) plus 1%, or (ii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate equal to the LIBO Rate for the Interest Period multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (each term as defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement), plus in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate (i) for base rate loans ranges from 0.25% to 1.0% per annum and (i) for LIBO Rate loans ranges from 1.25% to 2.0% per annum, in each case, based on the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement). The Adjusted LIBO Rate cannot be less than zero. Base rate borrowings may only be made in dollars. The 2019 Credit Agreement also includes a fallback provision, which, subject to certain terms and conditions, provides for a replacement of the LIBO Rate with (x) one or more SOFR-based rates or (y) any other alternative benchmark rates giving consideration to any evolving or then existing conventions for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities. The borrower will pay a commitment fee during the term of the 2019 Credit Agreement ranging from 0.20% to 0.35% of the available revolving commitments per annum based on the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement).\nAny borrowing under the 2019 Credit Agreement may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time without premium or penalty other than customary breakage costs, and any amounts repaid may be reborrowed. No mandatory prepayments will be required other than when borrowings or letter of credit usage exceed the aggregate commitment of all lenders.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents a summary of our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated.\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n22,375\n$\n5,795\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(48,320)\n(19,756)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n103,009\n(2,020)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n1,049\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n78,113\n$\n(15,757)\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period\n68,386\n84,143\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period\n$\n146,499\n$\n68,386\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our customers for subscriptions and professional services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, marketing expenses and third-party hosting costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $22.4 million, reflecting our net loss of $11.9 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $47.4 million and net cash outflows of $13.1 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, amortization of deferred commissions, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets and deferred income taxes. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities related to a $14.7 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of receipt of payment from our customers, an increase of $10.3 million in deferred commissions due to an increase in the capitalization of commissions, as well as a $3.4 million decrease in accrued compensation and a $3.3 million increase in prepaid expenses due to the timing of cash disbursements. These increases were partially offset by a $13.5 million decrease in contract assets due to the issuance of invoices and the timing of revenue recognition and a $4.9 million increase in deferred revenue due to an increase in deals signed in 2020 which were billed up front.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $5.8 million due to our net loss of $1.5 million that was adjusted for non-cash charges of $41.7 million and net cash outflows of $34.4 million provided by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, amortization of deferred commissions, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets, loss on extinguishment of debt and deferred income taxes. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities related to an $18.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of receipt of payment from our customers, an $18.5 million increase in contract assets due to a large number of multi-year deals being signed in the fourth quarter of 2019, a $9.1 million increase in deferred commissions and a $6.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets due to the timing of cash disbursements. These were partially offset by a $12.1 million increase in deferred revenue related to the upfront invoicing of certain customers in accordance with their subscription agreements as well as a $6.3 million increase in accrued expenses and other due to the timing of payments.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $48.3 million and $19.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, an increase of $28.5 million. The net increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of ShoCard and Symphonic for a total of $32.5 million in cash, both of which occurred in the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as a $2.8 million increase in the capitalization of internal-use software costs. These outflows were partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of $6.1 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $103.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 whereas net cash used in financing activities was $2.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our primary cash inflows related to the draw down on our 2019 Revolving Credit Facility of $97.8 million that occurred in March 2020 and receipt of proceeds from stock option exercises of $10.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. These increases were partially offset by $4.5 million used in the payments for tax withholding on equity awards. Conversely, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we received proceeds from our IPO of $200.5 million, proceeds from the refinancing of our long-term debt of $52.2 million, and receipt of proceeds from stock option exercises of $1.6 million, offset by the payment of long-term debt, issuance costs of long-term debt and deferred offering costs of $248.8 million, $1.2 million and $5.2 million, respectively, as well as the payment of Elastic Beam contingent compensation of $1.1 million.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify customers, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we previously entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain officers and employees that require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. No demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements and there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, or consolidated statements of cash flows.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nThe JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. On June 30, 2020, the last day of the Company\u2019s second fiscal quarter in 2020, the market value of the Company\u2019s common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million. Accordingly, the Company was deemed a large accelerated filer as of December 31, 2020 and can no longer take advantage of the extended timeline to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, impacting our reported results of operations and financial condition.\nThe estimates used by management are based on historical experience and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are described below. Refer to \u201cNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more detailed information regarding our significant accounting policies.\nAcquisitions and Identifiable Intangible Assets\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on significant judgments and estimates made by management. We typically engage third-party valuation appraisal firms to assist in determining the fair values of the assets acquired. Such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and also include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows earned from the product-related technology and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nStock Options and LTIP Awards\nWe have granted certain awards to our employees, including stock options and LTIP awards, that are subject to market and performance conditions for which we are required to assess the probability of vesting. These awards will vest following both (i) an IPO and registration of shares of common stock of Ping Identity Holding\nCorp. and (ii) Vista realizing a cash return on its investment in the Company equaling or exceeding $1.491 billion. At each reporting period, we estimated the probability of these awards meeting the conditions noted above based on historical experience, market conditions contributing to forecasted future share prices of our common stock and information obtained from management and Vista regarding the sale of shares.\nWhen the vesting of the awards becomes probable, stock-based compensation expense for the options subject to market and performance conditions is recognized on a graded vesting basis over the term of the award. The LTIP awards, which could provide cash compensation to certain employees upon vesting, are liability-classified and thus require us to remeasure the fair value of the awards at each reporting period until the awards are settled, thus recognizing any changes in fair value through compensation expense.\nThe assumptions used in determining when the probability threshold is met reflect our best estimates but involve uncertainties related to market and other conditions, many of which are outside our control. As the determination of probability has a direct impact on the pattern of recognition of compensation expense associated with these awards, changes in our assumptions may affect the amount of compensation expense we recognize in a given period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of our recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted, see \u201cNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

    "item_1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nOur Mission\nOur mission is to create enterprise-grade technology for small and medium businesses (\"SMBs\") delivered through our growing, global network of managed service provider (\"MSP\") partners.\nOverview\nDatto Holding Corp. (\"Datto Holding\", \"Datto\", \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cthe Company\u201d) is the leading provider of cloud-based software and technology solutions purpose-built for delivery through the MSP channel to SMBs. MSPs represent the future of information technology (\"IT\") management for SMBs. Digital transformation is driving SMB adoption of modern software and technology, while regulatory and data protection requirements and proliferating security threats are increasing the complexity and risk of IT for SMBs. These trends have created an inflection point in SMB outsourcing to MSPs for IT management. MSPs are equipped with the IT resources and expertise SMBs lack, serving as a single provider to meet all of an SMB\u2019s IT needs. MSPs are trusted to select, procure, implement and manage software and technology stacks that support their SMB customers\u2019 business needs. The number of MSPs continues to grow, with approximately 125,000 MSPs providing this critical function to millions of SMBs worldwide today.\nWe are committed to the success of MSPs. It is the foundation of our strategy and culture. We empower our MSP partner channel, creating enormous sales and support leverage for us to efficiently address the large but fragmented SMB IT market. Our MSP-centric platform enables our partners to generate recurring revenue through the sale of our solutions to SMBs and to scale and effectively manage their own businesses. Our relationships are directly with our MSP partners. We are the leading pure-play vendor serving the MSP market, and believe our MSP-centric approach is highly differentiating as it aligns our mutual incentives, creates a motivated and engaged sales channel and reinforces our position as an integral component of our MSP partners\u2019 businesses.\nOur cloud-based offerings include Unified Continuity, Networking and Business Management software solutions. Our Unified Continuity and Networking offerings ensure the ongoing availability and security of mission-critical IT systems for SMBs on-premise, in private clouds and in the public cloud. These solutions are simple for MSPs to deploy, configure and manage across their SMB customers through a single portal. Our Business Management software provides critical operational tools to MSPs for efficient workflow management and delivery of end-to-end managed services. Our platform also includes a host of business development tools, training and content to help MSPs address the challenges of marketing and selling to SMB customers.\nWe employ a land-and-expand business model and grow as our MSP partners grow. We seek to deliver tools and resources that are easy to adopt and enable recurring revenue growth and margin efficiency for our MSP partners. Our partners can expand their footprint with us on a frictionless basis as they increase the number of SMB customers they serve and the number of Datto products that they sell through to their SMB customers. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our dollar-based net retention rate was 111% and 119%, respectively. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Performance Metrics\u201d for additional information regarding our dollar-based net retention rate.\nWe have a highly efficient go-to-market model, in which we leverage our sales force and the power of our brand to attract, retain and grow our MSP partners. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 17,000 MSP partners, of which over 1,100 accounted for annual run-rate revenue, or ARR, of $100,000 or more each. MSP partners with over $100,000 of ARR accounted for 47% of our total ARR as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 our 10 largest partners represented approximately 3% of our ARR and no single partner represented more than 0.8% of our ARR. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Performance Metrics\u201d for additional information regarding ARR.\nOur business has experienced rapid growth since inception and generates revenue that is highly recurring. As of December 31, 2020, our ARR was $542.8 million and our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $518.8 million, of which approximately 94% was recurring subscription revenue. As of December 31, 2019, our ARR was $474.8 million and our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $458.8 million, of which approximately 90% was recurring subscription revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net income was $22.5 million and our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") was $150.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our net loss was $31.2 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $84.6 million. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA\u201d for additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA.\nIndustry Background\nSignificant industry trends are impacting the market for MSP-delivered IT, including:\n\u2022MSPs represent the future of IT management for SMBs. As dedicated technology experts, MSPs are equipped with the IT resources and expertise SMBs lack, providing a single source to meet all of an SMB\u2019s IT needs. MSPs are trusted to select, procure and implement software and technology stacks for their SMB customers. After implementation, MSPs provide ongoing value to SMBs through strategic guidance, technical support, monitoring and maintenance of their full IT environments.\n\u2022 IT providers are transitioning to a recurring managed services model. Globally, the number of MSPs continues to grow as organizations across the broader IT services landscape, including professional services providers, IT consultants, systems integrators and value-added resellers, transition to a managed services model.\nA number of technology trends have created an inflection point in SMBs\u2019 outsourcing to MSPs for IT management. These trends are greatly increasing the complexity of the IT challenges faced by SMBs and include:\n\u2022SMBs are increasingly adopting digital and cloud-based technologies. In response to competitive pressures and the demands of customers and employees, businesses are increasingly adopting digital and cloud-based technologies to help them transform their operations and compete in the marketplace. Even traditionally offline businesses are increasingly embracing technology to help them more efficiently market to, transact with and support customers, as well as to run their own operations. With the democratization of technology, SMBs are under pressure to adopt digital solutions with enterprise-grade capabilities or risk being disrupted by their competitors. We believe that new business challenges arising from the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\") pandemic are accelerating the digital transformation of SMBs. According to the International Data Corporation, a global research firm, by 2023, 67% of SMBs will have digital transformation as a key part of their IT strategy.\n\u2022Modern technologies are driving complexity in IT. The accelerating pace of technological advancement and proliferation of software and technology offerings are increasing the difficulty for businesses to evaluate, select and implement an optimal IT environment. With the adoption of modern technologies, IT systems have become increasingly linked to business operations and to each other through complex integrations, greatly heightening the importance of effective IT management.\n\u2022SMB exposure to security and regulatory risk is increasing. SMBs are increasingly collecting, generating and storing data to perform mission-critical functions. Recognizing the criticality and potential value of this data, bad actors are increasingly targeting SMBs to exploit their perceived security vulnerabilities. According to a survey of our MSP partners during 2020, 78% of MSPs reported ransomware attacks against their SMB customers over the last two years, including 60% reporting attacks in just the first six months of 2020. Cybersecurity Ventures, an IT research firm, predicts that ransomware attacks will cause nearly $20 billion in damage globally by 2021. Moreover, SMB data is potentially subject to various and ever-evolving regulatory regimes, creating the additional challenge of ensuring ongoing compliance.\n\u2022SMBs are not equipped to meet the expanding challenges of IT management. Despite requiring certain capabilities of enterprise-grade technology solutions, SMBs lack the time, resources and expertise to deploy, manage and maintain an enterprise-grade IT stack. Grappling with the day-to-day management of IT also takes time and resources away from advancing core business goals.\n\u2022The costs of downtime or data loss are meaningful and expanding. With increasingly digital operations, system downtime or data loss results in lost revenue, customer churn, negative brand perception and reduced employee productivity. For SMBs, these losses can be catastrophic, with the potential to result in significant business disruptions or even bankruptcy, driving the need for comprehensive and effective enterprise-grade continuity solutions.\nOur Differentiated Approach\nWe are committed to the success of MSPs. It is the foundation of our strategy and culture. We believe our MSP-centric approach is highly differentiating because it aligns our mutual incentives, creates a motivated and engaged sales channel and ensures we become an integral component of our MSP partners\u2019 businesses. Our approach, combined with our expansive platform, has helped to establish us as the leading pure-play vendor serving the MSP market, with an extensive network of more than 17,000 MSP partners. We empower our MSP partner channel, creating enormous sales and support leverage for us to efficiently address the large, but fragmented, SMB IT market.\nOur Unified Continuity and Networking solutions generate recurring revenue for MSPs as part of their managed services for SMBs. MSPs integrate these solutions into managed services that they offer to their SMB customers on their own terms, including pricing, packaging, billing and solution-bundling giving MSPs greater control over growth and profitability of their managed services. We also provide visibility and predictability to our MSP partners by delivering our solutions on a subscription basis.\nOur Business Management offerings further this overall value proposition, enabling MSPs to scale and optimize the workflows and business processes associated with managed services delivery. Our solutions are purpose-built to address the specific needs of MSPs, enabling them to improve customer satisfaction, increase productivity, decrease response times and reduce costs, enhancing the overall profitability of their businesses.\nOur platform also features business development tools and content to help MSPs address the challenges of marketing and selling to SMBs. We do not directly market or sell to SMBs to avoid competing with our MSP partners. Instead, we offer MSPs tools for marketing automation and content for marketing programs, as well as training and certifications. We further cultivate the broader MSP ecosystem through our thought leadership efforts and industry-leading events. Our open ecosystem events, such as DattoCon, DattoCon EMEA and MSP Technology Days, are among the largest MSP events in the world.\nOur singular dedication to our partners has enabled us to create a network of more than 17,000 MSPs that rely upon Datto solutions to serve over 1.5 million SMBs. Our model of distribution through this network of MSPs mitigates the challenges of addressing the SMB market and provides us with the following benefits:\n\u2022Sales leverage. The MSP channel creates enormous sales leverage for us to address the large but fragmented SMB IT market. With each of our sales representatives capable of reaching dozens of MSPs, who in turn can serve hundreds of SMBs, the reach of our sales force is greatly amplified.\n\u2022Recurring revenue durability. Our direct contractual relationships with MSP partners insulate us from SMB churn from bankruptcy, consolidation or other adverse events. In the event of SMB customer loss, the associated MSP will often maintain their revenue stream by migrating that customer\u2019s Datto stack to a different customer.\n\u2022Natural revenue expansion. Once we are engaged with an MSP, our revenue expands naturally as that MSP adds existing and new SMB customers to our platform, upgrades service tiers or purchases more of our solutions to meet growing data protection or networking needs and cross-sells additional solutions into its customer base.\n\u2022Support and service leverage. We provide 24/7 direct-to-tech support to our MSP partners, who are responsible for providing higher touch implementation and ongoing support services to their SMB customers. This approach allows us to avoid the significant cost associated with providing support and service activities to over 1.5 million SMBs.\nKey Strengths of Our Solutions\nDatto is the largest pure-play vendor serving the MSP market with a unified, cloud-based platform that enables the end-to-end delivery of managed IT services to SMBs. Our platform combines mission-critical software, technologies and security solutions that MSPs sell to SMBs with business management software to help MSPs scale and grow their own businesses. Our solutions include Unified Continuity, Networking and Business Management.\nUnified Continuity Solutions\nUnified Continuity constitutes a suite of cloud-managed products and security solutions, including business continuity and disaster recovery, or BCDR, and SaaS protection. These products provide enterprise-grade data protection, ensure business uptime and establish a last line of defense against security threats by enabling the full image backup, virtualization, cloud replication and restoration of entire physical or virtual servers and PCs, whether on-premise at an SMB, remotely in a data center or in the cloud. The key differentiators of our Unified Continuity solutions include:\n\u2022Built for MSPs. We provide turnkey solutions that are remotely configurable out-of-the-box and are fast and easy to deploy. Once deployed, data automatically begins flowing into the private Datto cloud platform, or the Datto Cloud, and can be managed through the Datto partner portal, which provides MSPs with a multi-tenant view of all their SMB customers.\n\u2022Comprehensive protection for the full IT environment. Our solutions provide comprehensive protection of data and applications to efficiently prevent data loss, mitigate ransomware attacks and minimize downtime for MSPs\u2019 SMB customers. This includes the ability to protect and quickly restore full physical, virtual or cloud environments to any point in time, in a hardware-agnostic manner, as well as the ability to seamlessly protect and recover data from public cloud SaaS applications. Our solutions are often a last line of defense when an SMB's firewalls are breached or a network is compromised through an employee clicking on a phishing email.\n\u2022Highly reliable and performant. Our solutions replicate environments across multiple locations to create redundancy and ensure partner-managed environments are fully protected. Our solutions continually validate that these environments can be fully restored through multiple layers of verification, including automated ransomware scanning, disk and service integrity checks and testing of the virtual machine. In an adverse event, our solutions are capable of providing near-instantaneous virtualization in our cloud, temporary failover and high-performance recovery to the local network to ensure ongoing continuity of the SMB\u2019s systems, minimizing costly downtime.\nNetworking Solutions\nNetworking refers to our collection of integrated WiFi access points and connectivity offerings that enable MSPs to efficiently offer highly performant and reliable cloud-managed networking to their SMB customers. The key differentiators of our Networking solutions include:\n\u2022Built for MSPs. Our networking solutions are purpose-built to align with the needs of MSPs in delivering managed networking. Our solutions enable remote monitoring and management from the cloud, providing MSPs with a multi-tenant view of all networks and connected devices, with automated event alerts and visual indicators of each device\u2019s status. They also enable efficient management through seamless native integration with critical MSP tools.\n\u2022Efficient deployment. Our solutions allow MSPs to preconfigure customer network settings, enabling the plug-and-play self-formation of entire networks. Configurations can be cloned from similar existing networks, enabling MSPs to quickly and easily deploy new customer networks in a standardized and pre-defined manner.\n\u2022Highly reliable and performant. Our solutions are specifically designed to provide highly reliable and performant networking to help MSPs maximize uptime for SMB customers. Our networking solutions feature automatic failover and failback, self-healing mesh and channel scanning mechanisms to ensure customer networks maintain and optimize performance, even in the event of a disruption to primary connections or hardwired network lines.\nBusiness Management Solutions\nBusiness Management refers to our suite of integrated SaaS products for MSPs, including Autotask Professional Services Automation, or PSA, and Remote Monitoring and Management, or RMM, that provide critical operational tools to manage workflows and the delivery of end-to-end IT services. Built from inception to run in the cloud, these offerings allow MSPs to manage their businesses through a centralized hub and to increase operational efficiency. The key differentiators of our Business Management solutions include:\n\u2022Built for MSPs. Our business management solutions provide a fully integrated solution for single pane of glass management of the critical operational workflows and business processes of MSPs, including device management, ticketing, project management, customer relationship management, invoicing, inventory management and resource management. Our solutions offer embedded integrations with over a hundred other MSP tools and technologies for the seamless and efficient delivery of managed services.\n\u2022Cloud and mobile enabled. Our business management solutions are built for the cloud and include mobile device support, enabling the efficient and effective management of IT service delivery. With mobile-enabled solutions, technicians can access critical tools and systems from the field, increasing productivity and reducing costs.\n\u2022Complete visibility and control. Our business management solutions provide MSPs with full visibility into SMB customer environments with complete control to remotely remediate IT issues. Through our unified PSA and RMM offerings, our solutions provide dashboards, alerts, actionable insights, analytics and automation to help MSPs drive operational efficiency.\nKey Benefits to Our MSP Partners\nMSPs choose Datto and develop longstanding relationships with us not only for our innovative solutions but also for our comprehensive platform, which delivers the following key benefits to our MSP partners:\n\u2022Enable shift to managed IT services. By providing solutions specifically designed for delivery in a bundled suite of critical managed services, we facilitate the shift of IT services organizations to a recurring managed services model. With our platform, MSPs generate recurring revenue through the sale of our software and technology to SMBs on a subscription basis and thereby gain clear visibility into and predictability of revenue. Our suite of products provides our MSP partners with multiple avenues to land new customers and expand recurring revenue over time.\n\u2022Increase retention of SMB customers. Any time an SMB experiences a security downtime or data loss event, an MSP runs the risk of losing that customer. For this reason, MSPs seek reliable solutions that reduce the risk of SMB downtime and data loss. With our solutions, MSPs gain a last line of defense against security threats that ensures ongoing availability and comprehensive data protection, providing their SMB customers with peace of mind. Datto solutions have proven to be very reliable for MSP partners in enabling the efficient management of their customer base, preventing downtime and recovering from cyberattacks and data loss events. As a result, the MSP\u2019s role in securing SMBs\u2019 mission-critical systems solidifies the MSP\u2019s importance as a trusted partner to SMBs.\n\u2022Increase profit generation from SMB customers. Our solutions are competitively priced to enable our MSP partners to generate attractive profit margins. The pricing of our solutions for MSPs is generally based on a predetermined tier for a given solution, ensuring our MSP partners have visibility into delivery cost. The pricing of our solutions is not available to SMBs and our MSP partners have latitude to set the pricing, packaging and bundling of our solutions as a managed offering to their customers. As a result, our MSP partners can leverage our solutions to create reliable profit centers for their businesses.\n\u2022Avoid channel conflict. Unlike most technology and software vendors who sell to both MSPs and SMB customers, Datto does not compete with MSPs. Datto\u2019s MSP-centric approach enables us to focus solely on the needs of MSPs, designing our platform and solutions for this market. We provide MSPs with the tools and support they need to create and sell managed services to their SMB customers and the assurance we will not compete directly for the business of SMBs.\n\u2022Reduce the cost of managing SMB customer IT environments. Our remote monitoring and management product enables the delivery of end-to-end managed IT services by allowing MSPs to perform proactive monitoring, preventative maintenance and remote remediation of customer systems, applications and devices in real-time with intelligent alerting, auto-response and auto-resolution. Our cloud-based solutions help MSPs achieve better resource utilization by reducing costly truck rolls for on-site service and freeing up resources to pursue higher value activities.\n\u2022Enable operational efficiency. Our business management tools are easy to implement and use, enabling MSPs to operate their own businesses more efficiently through centralized operations from a single pane of glass. These software solutions are optimized for the business needs of MSPs to enable workflow automation and deliver actionable insights, providing full visibility into customer IT environments. Our solutions have embedded integrations with other Datto products and other services and technologies to make it easier for an MSP to manage a heterogeneous technology stack.\n\u2022Drive business growth. In addition to our products, our platform also includes a range of sales and marketing content, training and other programs as well as technical certifications tailored to our MSP partners to help them more effectively grow their businesses, alleviating a major pain-point for IT professionals with limited sales and marketing experience.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe pursue numerous actions to drive our growth in subscription revenue. Key elements of our growth strategy include:\n\u2022Expand our partner base by adding new MSPs. We believe that there is substantial opportunity to increase our penetration among MSPs. We intend to continue leveraging the strong awareness of our brand as a trusted partner to the MSP community to add new MSPs in the markets we serve. Since December 31, 2018, we expanded our MSP partner base from approximately 14,400 to over 17,000 at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Standardize MSP partners on our platform. Once an MSP partner joins our platform, our goal is to increase the penetration of our solutions across its existing SMB customer base. Typically, MSPs initially deploy our solutions to only a limited number of their SMB customers. Over time, MSPs often continue to migrate additional existing end-customers to our platform for the benefit of managing a single integrated solution stack. Our goal is to aid in this migration in order to increase our overall penetration into our MSP partners\u2019 existing SMB customer base.\n\u2022Empower our MSP partners to attract more SMBs. As SMBs increasingly rely on MSPs for IT management, we seek to grow our revenue by helping our existing MSP partners attract additional SMB customers that may ultimately adopt our solutions. We plan to continue developing marketing automation tools and content for marketing, as well as offering training and certifications, in order to facilitate our MSP partners\u2019 growth.\n\u2022Facilitate upsell and cross-sell activity with our MSP partners and their SMB customers. We intend to grow our sales teams in order to increase our sales with our MSP partners. Our sales teams upsell our MSP partners to higher service tier subscriptions as the data retention and bandwidth needs of their SMB customers grow. In addition, our sales teams upsell our MSP partners to increase their Business Management subscriptions as they grow. Our sales teams also actively cross-sell our products to our MSP partners, leveraging their positive experiences with our platform. Our dollar-based net retention rate, which was 111% as of December 31, 2020 and 119% as of December 31, 2019, demonstrates our ability to expand within existing MSP partners.\n\u2022Extend our product leadership and introduce new platform solutions. We continue to invest in new purpose-built product and service offerings to anticipate and meet the evolving demands of our MSP partners and their SMB customers. We will also continue to pursue opportunistic mergers and acquisitions to complement and enhance our current solution set.\n\u2022Expand our international footprint. We believe there is significant opportunity to expand into new international geographies, with approximately 73% of our revenue coming from the United States (\"U.S.\") in 2020. The maturity of the international SMB IT landscape varies; more mature markets represent growth opportunities in the near term, while less mature markets present a longer-term opportunity as MSPs develop within those markets.\nOur Products\nOur products include offerings in Unified Continuity, Networking and Business Management.\nUnified Continuity Products\nDatto Unified Continuity is a complete line of products that protect workloads - data, applications and configurations - located on laptops, workstations, physical and virtual servers and in the public cloud. There are five cloud-based products that together protect and restore workloads, reduce SMB downtime resulting from data or system loss and provide a last line of defense against security threats. These products include:\nBusiness Continuity and Disaster Recovery. MSPs use our all-in-one BCDR products to efficiently protect servers and workstations and minimize downtime for SMBs. SIRIS, Datto\u2019s flagship cloud-managed BCDR product, consists of a state-of-the-art physical or virtual device deployed by MSPs at a customer location or in a private data center, the agent software installed on protected servers and workstations and a cloud-based storage, virtualization and management system. SIRIS is available in service tiers ranging from one to 100 terabytes with a variety of data retention options.\nOnce an MSP deploys SIRIS, the agent software automatically transfers disk images of the protected machines to the SIRIS device at configurable intervals, as frequently as every five minutes. SIRIS verifies the integrity of every image, transfers a copy of that image to the secure Datto Cloud at selected intervals and can replicate that to a second geographically distributed data center if desired. In this manner, SIRIS establishes a last line of defense for all protected servers and workstations. In the event of a server or workstation security incident or outage, users can initiate a boot of the virtual image of the affected machines either in the SIRIS device or in the Datto Cloud in as little as six seconds.\nIn addition to SIRIS, BCDR products also include ALTO, a smaller capacity BCDR solution. Available in a 2 terabyte model, ALTO provides many of the same capabilities of SIRIS without local virtualization on the device. The same agents are used to collect server or workstation images and ALTO is managed from the same management portal in the Datto Cloud, but with ALTO all failover virtualization occurs only in the Datto Cloud.\nCloud Continuity. Cloud Continuity is the innovative all-in-one, image-based continuity solution for Windows-based PCs (laptops and desktops). Cloud Continuity takes an image of a protected PC and replicates it directly to the Datto Cloud without the need for a local device. Backup images include all PC files and data, as well as the configuration, settings and software. In the event of a ransomware attack, device loss or theft, or other event that renders the PC unusable, Cloud Continuity allows MSPs to quickly and easily restore to any PC hardware.\nSaaS Protection. SaaS Protection is a reliable, automated and secure backup and restoration product for Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace data. Microsoft and Google currently recommend the use of a third-party backup service because Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace do not backup user data. MSPs deploy SaaS Protection seamlessly for their SMB customers in a few simple steps, and can quickly start to take regular backups of user emails, files and sites, storing these backups in the Datto Cloud. MSPs help end-users easily recover from data loss, including ransomware attacks, accidental or malicious deletion and cancelled employee accounts-all from our cloud management portal.\nWorkplace. Datto Workplace is a complete cloud-hosted file sync and share solution enabling end-users to synchronize files across platforms, including mobile devices. Workplace also serves as a collaboration platform allowing users to share and work together on any type of document in its native file format. Centralized cloud management and sophisticated administrative controls at the end-user and group levels give MSPs and their SMB customers control over file governance. Critical business files are also protected via the ransomware detection and management feature, which gives users the ability to immediately revert back to safe file copies from before an infection, undoing the ransomware encryption of user data.\nFile Protection. Datto File Protection is an MSP-managed, secure and scalable backup product that enables MSPs to efficiently protect and recover files and folders on workstations and laptops of all types. File and folder backups protect unstructured data from ever-present threats such as human error, hardware failure, ransomware and lost or stolen devices. Users can quickly and easily access\nand restore their own files from the Datto Cloud, enabling them to recover from common data-loss scenarios without raising a support request, or MSPs can securely access customer accounts and restore data on their behalf.\nNetworking Products\nDatto Networking delivers a suite of cloud-managed networking products for MSPs to efficiently deploy to their SMB customers.\nNetworking products currently include:\nAccess Points. Our WiFi access points deliver high-powered wireless mesh networks with seamless roaming. These 802.11AC Wave 2 access points include a quad-core processor to ensure all of the Wave 2 features have the necessary processing power to deliver the performance required by SMBs.\nSwitches. We offer switches with 8, 24 and 48 port options, switching capacity ranging from 20 Gbps to 104 Gbps, and mounting options ranging from fanless desktop to rack mounted. MSPs can choose the form factor, performance and mounting options most appropriate for a particular SMB customer.\nEdge Routers. Our Edge Routers provide core functionality including intrusion detection and prevention and a firewall with stateful packet inspection, layer 7 DPI, port forwarding, DMZ host and VLAN segregation.\nBusiness Management Products\nBusiness Management consists of integrated SaaS offerings that enable MSPs to be more efficient at scale, including:\nAutotask Professional Services Automation. Autotask PSA is a complete IT business management product that is purpose-built for MSPs and delivers the mission-critical tools an MSP needs to run its business. Continuing to deliver 99.99% uptime in 2020, Autotask PSA pioneered cloud-delivered PSA and provides dashboards that help MSPs turn data into actionable business insights. It enables partners to monitor their sales pipeline, track technician productivity and evaluate customer profitability. It includes device management, ticketing, project management, customer relationship management, invoicing, inventory management and resource management. In addition, our open architecture application programming interface (\"API\") has enabled more than 100 industry-leading vendors to integrate their business-critical applications with Autotask PSA to further simplify workflows for MSPs. Autotask PSA centralizes business operations and enables quick, data-driven decisions through rich dashboards, customizable alerts and business intelligence tools.\nRemote Monitoring and Management. A key component of an MSP\u2019s security best practices, Datto RMM is a remote monitoring and management product designed to assist MSPs with their IT service delivery. Built for MSPs as a multi-tenant solution to manage millions of SMB customer endpoints in an efficient manner, Datto RMM is a fully cloud-managed, scalable SaaS product with integrated endpoint ransomware detection. The underlying architecture provides MSPs with the ability to remotely audit, patch, manage, monitor, support and report on SMB customers\u2019 local and public-cloud deployed endpoints. The platform offers a collection of tools for securely supporting thousands of devices without the need for extensive training. MSPs can use Datto RMM tools to create their own scripts, or easily plug in hundreds of pre-made scripts, to automate repetitive tasks like software patching or rapidly respond to security incidents with pre-defined actions. Integrations with Autotask PSA and other frequently-used solutions allow MSPs to seamlessly report on device status, issues and events. Using configurable dashboards, a simple menu system, remote takeover capability and the flexibility to operate from any internet-connected device, Datto RMM helps MSPs deliver better service and increase responsiveness for their SMB customers.\nOur Technology\nUnified Continuity, Networking and Business Management products are based on a two-level, multi-tenant, private, hybrid cloud architecture. Designed to provide ease of deployment and a high degree of flexibility, our technology enables MSP partners to deliver managed services across a broad range of scenarios at scale.\nKey features of our technologies include:\n\u2022Easy to use enterprise-grade technology. Our products are designed to be simple to deploy and easy to manage and are built on the latest enterprise-grade technology. This technology includes Type 1 hypervisors, industry-standard scalable monitoring, converged infrastructure and extensive security features. We abstract this complex technology from our MSPs with simple graphical user interfaces. Further, smart defaults and pre-configuration capabilities in our cloud enable MSPs to configure our products, ship them to end-customers and deploy them with minimal effort. Once deployed and configured, our products then connect to the Datto Cloud and begin uploading data. In this way, MSPs can provide secure enterprise-grade technology to their SMB customers without the hassles of deploying, integrating and managing enterprise products.\n\u2022Datto product integrations. We pioneered an integrated product portfolio tailored uniquely for MSPs. While Autotask PSA and Datto RMM can be offered as stand-alone products, they are also integrated with each other, allowing technicians to move seamlessly between our PSA and RMM. Integration between Datto RMM and our Networking solutions allows rapid troubleshooting and problem resolution of network issues. Integration between BCDR and PSA allows the PSA to collect and report on deployed devices and manage related support tickets. These integrations encourage MSPs to standardize across our solutions.\n\u2022Third-party product integrations. Datto supports an open technology ecosystem for MSPs. MSPs value using different tools from multiple vendors to deliver their managed services, creating unique and often differentiating technology stacks. Datto products are externally integrated with other products to make it easier for an MSP to manage a heterogeneous technology stack. Leveraging open APIs, third party vendors have built more than 200 integrations with our business management products. This includes everything from security tools to competitive remote monitoring and management and professional services automation vendors.\n\u2022Two-level multi-tenant architecture. All of our products share a two-tier multi-tenant design, which facilitates MSP management of both their own and the SMBs\u2019 environments. The first tier provides secure resource sharing among MSP partner accounts hosted on the Datto Cloud, while the second tier sits below each MSP account and provides a tenant-centric view of SMB customers for the MSP partner. Most other multi-tenant systems provide only a single level of tenant management.\n\u2022Private virtualization and storage cloud. Datto operates its own exabyte scale private cloud which provides us with control over the environment, efficient operating costs and flexibility to best support our partners. The Datto Cloud provides both compute and storage tiers at multiple geographically distributed data centers. This includes the option to replicate a second copy of SMB customer data to an alternative data center in region. We have developed a differentiated virtual machine (\"VM\") orchestration layer which allows shared management between our MSP partner and the Datto support organization.\n\u2022Proprietary work-flow engine. Autotask PSA incorporates a field-configurable business logic engine that allows the implementation of business processes without costly code customization. A single multi-tenant cloud architecture delivers scalable efficient deployment of custom workflows for each MSP partner, and enables partners to trigger actions and alerts based on real time internal data as well as data from third party products. This allows MSPs to deploy PSA to meet the needs of their business, rather than redesigning their business to meet the requirements of their chosen management software.\n\u2022Proprietary agent and agentless technology. We have developed several proprietary agents across our product lines, specifically BCDR, RMM and Cloud Continuity. Our Unified Continuity agents protect servers, workstations and PCs by deploying an endpoint resident software package or using an agentless approach for virtual machines and private clouds. We have developed both a robust agent and an agentless plugin that support virtual machine backup on Hyper-V and VMware. We have also developed RMM agents and API integrations that enable MSPs to monitor and manage SMB customer endpoints on premise and in the public cloud. By developing this proprietary technology, we can avoid reliance on third-party licensed backup agents.\n\u2022Proprietary remote access technology. Datto RMM incorporates near-instantaneous access to managed endpoints using 100% HTML5 technology with no local plugin required on the managed device. Not only is this technology secure and fast, it delivers cross browser compatibility. This enables technicians to address customer tickets from nearly any browser, including mobile devices and tablets. With better performance than third-party licensed options, Datto RMM also enables MSPs to deliver faster, more responsive service to their SMB customers.\n\u2022Proprietary virtual machine image verification technology. Our verification technology provides evidence that backups produced by our BCDR products are viable. This technology performs automated tests on every image for ransomware and disk integrity. \u201cScreenshot\u201d verification boots the virtual machine either on the device or in the cloud and performs additional automated testing for viability. This running instance of the protected virtual machine further allows the MSP partner to utilize our scripting API to run custom test scripts that validate functionality and data integrity beyond what can be normally evaluated through the built-in testing. This functionally is linked back through the multi-tenant portal and alerting system to provide the MSP partner with confirmation that their managed systems are protected.\n\u2022Cloud to cloud API-level connectivity. In addition to devices deployed on-premises, the Datto Cloud is designed to ingest data directly from SaaS applications hosted in public clouds. This API-level connectivity brokered through our multi-tenant portal provides the same level of management that our MSP partners expect from the hybrid cloud continuity products. We have worked with Microsoft and Google to make efficient use of Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace APIs and achieve efficient data ingest and restore services.\n\u2022Proprietary remote synchronization technology. Datto has developed proprietary synchronization technology across a wide range of use cases to allow SMB PCs and devices to efficiently and securely send data to the Datto Cloud without saturating local internet connections. This includes multi-pass synchronization technology that enables local workloads to continue to operate while a backup is taken and transmitted. It also includes file synchronization software, as well as differential assessment, transmission and verification capabilities to enable an MSP to control the transmission and verification of large data sets to the Datto Cloud.\n\u2022RMM integrated cloud-managed networking devices. By combining the network cloud API with RMM management dashboards, the Datto RMM engine is able to provide access to network configuration and runtime data that greatly exceeds off-the-shelf solutions reliant on SNMP for device connectivity. This cloud-level integration provides much greater control of Datto Networking devices than can be achieved by combining products from different networking and remote monitoring and management vendors. As a result, MSP technicians solving SMB customer tickets experience a seamless environment, increasing productivity and responsiveness.\n\u2022Proprietary embedded RMM Ransomware Detection. One of the largest security threats for MSPs and their SMB customers is ransomware, and Datto RMM now incorporates the first embedded ransomware detection algorithm into deployed RMM agents. On all Datto RMM managed devices, the agent now observes the local system for signs of crypto ransomware. When identified, the agent attempts to stop the encryption process and automatically isolates the system from the network, alerting the MSP to the infection. This allows MSPs to prevent the spread of ransomware, and proactively restore infected systems.\n\u2022Hyper-converged hybrid cloud connected edge device. Datto is differentiated in that it deploys a true hyper-converged continuity appliance that combines data storage with local compute capabilities. Alternative continuity systems generally only provide gateway functionality with virtualization occurring either exclusively in the cloud or on other equipment furnished by end-customers on-premises. Datto allows very flexible orchestration of VM instances in either the cloud or on the edge device.\nOur Partners\nDatto creates technology for MSPs, enabling them to deliver managed services to their SMB customers and also enabling MSPs to efficiently operate their own businesses. MSPs represent substantially all of our revenue and are referred to as our \u201cpartners.\u201d Our MSP partners purchase our products on a subscription basis for their own use or for inclusion in managed services sold to their end-customers in a recurring revenue model. Our MSP partners range in size from very small to mid-sized, and primarily serve small and medium-sized businesses, often managing an SMB customer\u2019s entire IT environment. In smaller MSPs, the business owner or CEO is typically the purchaser of Datto products, and in larger MSPs, the purchaser is often the Vice President of Product or CTO.\nOur Business Management products are purchased by an MSP for their own use, with subscription fees based on their number of seats or by number of managed SMB devices. Our Unified Continuity and Networking products are purchased by an MSP for resale to their SMB customers, with subscription fees based on service tier and device count or the number of Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace employee accounts at the SMB domains that our MSP partners protect through our SaaS Protection products. Generally, an MSP first purchases a device or seats to assess our products and include them in their managed services. Following a successful initial assessment, the MSP typically purchases and deploys additional devices and seats for its customers over time.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we partnered with more than 17,000 MSPs serving over 1.5 million SMBs across more than 25 countries. We count partners as MSPs with active subscriptions for one or more of our products at the end of the measured period. Our revenue is highly diversified across our entire partner base, with no single partner making up more than 0.8% of our ARR. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 1,100 MSP partners that each contributed more than $100,000 of ARR.\nExamples of use cases of MSP partners leveraging our solutions to deliver value to their SMB customers include:\n\u2022utilizing our BCDR solutions to help an SMB roll back its IT environment after a phishing e-mail and ransomware has compromised that SMB\u2019s systems;\n\u2022upon a server failure, helping an SMB to switch over to our local device until that SMB\u2019s environment has been restored;\n\u2022enabling an SMB to operate its environment in our cloud in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake;\n\u2022after an end-customer accidentally misplaces a laptop, helping the customer restore the lost environment onto new hardware;\n\u2022recovering data and files from our cloud when a customer accidentally deletes a file from Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace;\n\u2022utilizing Datto Networking solutions to provide production, point of sale, network connectivity and guest Wi-Fi services for a conference or event; and\n\u2022using the Datto partner portal to remotely diagnose and fix an SMB\u2019s laptop issues.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a dynamic industry driven by the technology needs of SMBs and MSPs. Our competition is generally comprised of enterprise IT vendors and emerging innovators with niche point solutions. These competitors include:\n\u2022Continuity vendors that provide image-based backup solutions with on-premise only, cloud-only or hybrid infrastructure. The level of continuity provided by image-based backup vendors varies widely, from simple image copy to complex image orchestration, copy, failover and failback. Many vendors providing continuity solutions are not exclusively focused on serving MSPs.\n\u2022Networking vendors that sell a mix of edge routers, WiFi access points and switches to small, medium and large businesses. Typically, these vendors deliver either enterprise scale products at a high price point, or commodity products at a low price point. Enterprise scale products are designed for the many unique demands of large-scale enterprises and are complex to configure and manage. Commodity hardware vendors provide performant products with fewer features at a lower price point, often not designed for MSP deployment and management.\n\u2022Business management software vendors that focus a significant portion of their business on the MSP market provide vertically integrated service management platforms and tools to MSPs to help them operate more efficiently. Many of these vendors are not solely focused on the MSP market, and sell directly to end customers to augment their revenue.\nKey competitive factors in our market include:\n\u2022reliability and performance of solutions that protect workloads - data, applications and configurations - and ensure uptime for SMBs;\n\u2022MSP-centric, turnkey product capabilities including reliability, multi-tenant cloud management, ease of deployment and manageability at scale;\n\u2022ability to provide recurring revenue and margin for MSPs;\n\u2022quality and availability of service and support;\n\u2022brand awareness, reputation and influence among MSPs; and\n\u2022programs, tools and content that help MSPs grow their businesses.\nWe believe that we compete favorably on these factors.\nMarketing and Sales\nOur marketing and sales approach begins with our leading content marketing programs that attract MSPs, nurturing these contacts and then efficiently delivering qualified leads to our sales team to close. Once a new MSP is added to our platform, our sales team works with them to help them grow. Using our go-to-market enablement programs, MSPs add new SMBs and sell additional Datto products to their existing SMB customers. Post-sales engagement with our service and success teams ensures partners are either effectively using or are enabled to resell our products, and ongoing relationship management at scale allows our partners to sell and cross-sell more of our products.\nMarketing\nOur marketing engine delivers industry-leading content, which drives our target audience-MSP business owners and decision makers-to request a demo or become a partner. We distribute our content through a number of digital marketing platforms (social, pay-per-click, search engine optimization, syndication, webinars), and we leverage demos to nurture and further qualify leads. Analytics of this process enable us to fine tune programs and content to drive more successful and qualified lead generation.\nWe categorize our leads based on propensity to buy using a real-time analytical model. We leverage high touch tactics to attract the higher scoring leads and rely on self-service at the low end. We market Datto as the MSP technology company, creating technology for SMBs delivered by MSPs. Once an MSP becomes a Datto partner, we help it grow with a variety of programs to ensure they are optimally using the products they purchased and are enabled to resell our products through to SMB customers. Our marketing programs\nalso help our partners attract new SMB customers. We leverage our in-depth knowledge and understanding of MSPs to design these free programs, which include a marketing automation tool, robust marketing content, sales training and certifications.\nWe also foster one of the largest MSP communities in the world through our numerous events. DattoCon, DattoCon EMEA and MSP Technology Days are among the largest MSP events in the world. Our dedicated community development team hosts over 100 Datto virtual and in-person events annually for our partners and prospects around the globe, educating them on best practices, refreshing them on the latest technology and providing insights they can use to grow their businesses. We also exhibit at third-party in person and virtual tradeshows where we continue to engage with MSPs and expand the Datto brand. We believe that fostering a cohesive MSP community and serving as a trusted thought leader for MSPs around the world helps drive MSP growth, which in turn drives Datto growth. These events, combined with our content and digital marketing strategies, help ensure that our partners stay in touch with our brand, maintaining our lead in the MSP market.\nSales\nWe believe that leveraging the MSP channel creates high levels of sales productivity at low customer acquisition costs, allowing us to efficiently reach SMBs. We add MSP partners to our platform primarily through our sales team. There are three sales teams pursuing new MSP partners and covering our existing partner base: Sales Development Representatives (\"SDRs\"), Territory Sales Representatives (\"Hunters\") and Channel Growth Representatives (\"Farmers\"). SDRs review leads from our marketing team and qualify new partner opportunities, and Hunters are responsible for pursuing and closing these opportunities, leading to a new MSP partner adopting one or more of our products. Farmers work with our partners after their first purchase and build relationships, focusing on upsell and cross-sell opportunities. Our sales teams are organized by geography, consisting of the Americas, EMEA and APAC.\nOur MSP partners become multipliers to our sales team with our Unified Continuity and Networking products. With aligned incentives, our Farmers and our partners\u2019 own sales teams work together at scale using a range of \u201csell with\u201d tactics to help such partners grow their base of SMB customers purchasing managed services powered by Datto solutions and expand their footprint within those customers. Further, our Farmers support MSPs with the enablement and training resources available on our marketing platform to help new and existing partners grow their installed base across our products.\nServices, Success and Support\nServices and Success\nOur services team onboards MSP partners, helps them properly configure and implement our solutions and trains them to use our products to their fullest potential. Our success team provides cross-functional support for partners to drive increased adoption, product usage and subscription renewals and is responsible for relationship and escalation management.\nSupport\nOur support team includes experienced, trained resources located around the world to provide 24x7x365 technical support for all our products. Support is included in all our offerings as long as an MSP partner\u2019s subscription is active. All support tiers offer maintenance releases, patches and access to our support services and portal, including a documentation and knowledge repository, how-to guides, videos and a community where our partners can ask questions and find answers. Our support is distinguished by our \u201cdirect to tech\u201d support model whereby our expert technicians immediately answer support calls and speak directly with partners to resolve issues. This includes \u201ccode red\u201d support where we work with an MSP partner during a disaster or other incident to minimize disruption to their customer\u2019s business.\nSimilar to the sales leverage we gain through the MSP channel, our partners also are a multiplier for our support team because they perform first-level technical support with SMBs, only calling Datto when they are unable to resolve an issue. In complex situations such as multiple or repeat issues affecting an MSP, our success team may get involved in an escalation. Our executive leaders also regularly speak with partners as part of our commitment to openness and accessibility.\nProduct Development\nProduct development and innovation are at the core of our business. We not only invent technology, but we also reinvent it for MSPs. Our research and development teams are composed of product management, software development and infrastructure engineering functions. These groups are responsible for the design, development, testing and delivery of our solutions. We build our products from inception to serve the needs of MSPs and their SMB customers and continually seek to improve those products.\nWe have designed our development processes to be highly responsive and cost-efficient. Our diversified global footprint allows us to source from a large pool of talented resources by participating in multiple labor markets. We utilize an Agile development process and small Scrum teams, each dedicated to specific product modules that follow a standard set of best practices and a common set of development values.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how and brands. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 20 issued U.S. patents, with expiration dates ranging from September 2025 to May 2039. We have also filed approximately 21 currently pending patent applications. We do not believe that we are materially dependent on any one of our patents, issued or pending.\nWe require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and we control and monitor access to our software, proprietary technology and documents and other confidential information. Our policy is to require all employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, developments, processes and other intellectual property generated by them on our behalf and under which they agree to protect our confidential information.\nAlthough we rely on intellectual property rights as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new services, features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 1,743 employees, of which 1,327 (76%) were employed in the United States and 416 (24%) were employed outside of the United States. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be good. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. However, for one of our foreign subsidiaries, a works council represents our employees. We believe that our ability to recruit, retain and develop highly skilled talent is critical to our future success and growth. We provide our employees with competitive compensation and benefits, including opportunities for equity ownership, a 401(k) plan with company matching contributions, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, parental and family leave, and paid time off.\nWe strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind. We believe that fostering this environment builds a foundation on which our employees are empowered to do their life's work. Our employee resource groups (\"ERGs\") are company-sponsored groups of employees that promote and support certain objectives including inclusion and diversity, career development and networking. As of December 31, 2020, we had four ERGs including those supporting Women in Technology, the LGBTQ community, people of color and LatinX. We aim to ensure our employees are aware of different ways to notify management of inappropriate behavior, including through a confidential hotline. Any and all reports of inappropriate behavior are taken very seriously and thoroughly investigated and remediated.\nIn addition, we offer high-quality learning experiences across our global business. This includes an extensive onboarding program, robust sales, product and technical training, as well as a comprehensive professional skills curriculum focused on managerial and leadership skills. We also launched an internal networking and mentoring program intended to connect employees across Datto to foster relationships, development and exchange professional and personal experiences, skills, and career paths.\nGeneral Corporate Information\nWe were incorporated in 2017 as Merritt Topco, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and changed our name to Datto Holding Corp. in connection with our initial public offering in 2020.

We therefore encourage investors and others interested in our company to review all such mediums.\nImplications of Being an Emerging Growth Company\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) December 31, 2025, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer (this means the market value of common that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year) or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.\nAn emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and\n\u2022exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding financial statements and executive compensation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and expect to elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our shareholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.\nThe JOBS Act also permits an emerging growth company like us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to opt-in to this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards on a non-delayed basis.",
    "item_7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled \"Forward Looking Statements,\" the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019 and for 2019 compared to 2018 is presented below.\nOverview\nDatto is the leading provider of cloud-based software and technology solutions purpose-built for delivery through the managed service provider, or MSP, channel to small and medium businesses, or SMBs. We enable our more than 17,000 MSP partners to manage and grow their businesses serving the SMB information technology, or SMB IT, market. Our platform combines mission-critical cloud-based software, technologies and security solutions that MSPs sell to SMBs, business management software to help MSPs scale their own businesses, and marketing tools, content, training and industry-leading events that cultivate an empowered and highly engaged MSP partner community.\nMSPs represent the future of IT management for SMBs. Digital transformation is driving SMB adoption of modern software and technology, while regulatory and data protection requirements and proliferating security threats are increasing the complexity and risk of IT for SMBs. These trends have created an inflection point in SMB outsourcing to MSPs for IT management. MSPs are equipped with the IT resources and expertise SMBs lack, providing a single source to meet all of an SMB\u2019s IT needs. MSPs are trusted to select, procure, implement and manage software and technology stacks that support their SMB customers\u2019 business needs. The number of MSPs continues to grow, with approximately 125,000 MSPs providing this critical function to millions of SMBs worldwide today.\nWe are committed to the success of MSPs. It is the foundation of our strategy and culture. We empower our MSP partner channel, creating enormous sales and support leverage for us to efficiently address the large, but fragmented, SMB IT market. Our MSP-centric platform enables our partners to generate recurring revenue through the sale of our solutions to SMBs and to scale and effectively manage their own businesses. Our relationships are directly with our MSP partners. We are the leading pure-play vendor serving the MSP market, and believe our MSP-centric approach is highly differentiating as it aligns our mutual incentives, creates a motivated and engaged sales channel and reinforces our position as an integral component of our MSP partners\u2019 businesses.\nOur cloud-based platform provides Unified Continuity, Networking and Business Management software solutions. Our Unified Continuity offerings ensure the ongoing availability and security of mission-critical IT systems for SMBs on-premise, in private clouds and in the public cloud. Datto\u2019s business continuity and disaster recovery, or BCDR, software, enables rapid restoration of an SMB\u2019s full IT environment. Datto\u2019s SaaS Protection is a reliable, automated and secure backup and restoration product for data stored on cloud applications such as Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace. Datto Networking constitutes a suite of MSP-centric networking solutions sold through our MSP partners to easily deliver networking as a managed service. These solutions are simple for MSPs to deploy, configure and manage across their SMB customers through a single portal. Our Business Management software provides critical operational tools to MSPs for efficient workflow management and delivery of end-to-end managed services. Our platform also includes a host of business development tools, training and content to help MSPs address the challenges of marketing and selling to SMB customers.\nDatto was founded in 2007. From the very start, we have been creators of technology solutions for SMBs, typically only available to enterprises at the time, and recognized the power of the MSP channel. We have designed our strategy, culture and technology solutions to drive the success of our MSP partners. We have developed our platform and expanded our solutions to meet the evolving needs of MSPs, and we continually invest in cultivating the MSP community.\nOur Business Model\nWe are committed to the success of MSPs. It is the foundation of our strategy and culture. Our cloud-based solutions are purpose-built to address the needs of MSPs and to enable the end-to-end delivery of managed services to their SMB customers. We believe our MSP-centric approach is highly differentiating because it aligns our mutual incentives, creates a motivated and engaged sales channel and ensures we become an integral component of our MSP partners\u2019 businesses. We empower our MSP partner channel, creating\nenormous sales and support leverage for us to efficiently address the large, but fragmented, SMB IT market. We do not market or sell to SMBs directly to avoid competing with our MSP partners, and instead, invest in helping MSPs thrive.\nWe generate substantially all our revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our cloud-based solutions and recognize revenue ratably over the subscription term. These contracts typically begin with a 1-year or 3-year term and auto-renew on a monthly or annual basis thereafter. For certain offerings, we enable our ongoing subscription services with an up-front sale of equipment or professional services that we recognize at the time of delivery and performance. The majority of our partners pay on a monthly basis, regardless of term length, with some opting to make quarterly, annual or multi-year prepayments.\nUnified Continuity subscriptions are priced based on service tier, which is determined by data storage capacity and data retention period for our BCDR products, or by number of Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace employee accounts at the SMB domains that our MSP partners protect and data retention period for SaaS Protection offerings. Networking subscriptions are priced based on the volume and type of networking devices ordered. Business Management subscriptions are priced based on the number of employees at an MSP that are able to utilize our PSA product, or per endpoint device at the SMB for our RMM software. All of our contracts give us the right to increase prices at our discretion, although we have exercised this right infrequently.\nWe employ a highly efficient land-and-expand sales strategy facilitated by offering products that are reliable, easy to adopt and that drive recurring revenue growth and margin efficiency for our MSP partners. We sell our solutions to MSPs primarily through our sales team, leveraging the reach of our MSP partners and providing them with self-service options to upgrade service tiers, add volume and purchase additional solutions. Our MSP partners often significantly increase usage from their initial purchase and expand their usage to other products on our platform. We also provide access to business development tools and content to help MSPs address the challenges of marketing and selling to SMB customers. We grow alongside our MSP partners as they deploy our solutions across their existing SMB customers, add new customers and upgrade service tiers.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our ARR was $542.8 million and our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $518.8 million, of which approximately 94% was recurring subscription revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net income was $22.5 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $150.5 million. As of December 31, 2019, our ARR was $474.8 million and our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $458.8 million, of which approximately 90% was recurring subscription revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our net loss was $31.2 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $84.6 million. Refer to our discussion of ARR in Key Performance Metrics and Adjusted EBITDA in Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\nImpact of COVID-19\nWhile we have not incurred significant disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact on our business because of numerous uncertainties, including but not limited to, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the reoccurrence or emergence of variants of the virus, the effectiveness and speed of vaccinations, actions taken by government authorities, the impact on our customers and suppliers, and other factors. Specifically, we may experience impacts from customers deferring purchasing and activation decisions, reducing expenses and requesting extended payment terms or relief from payments.\nThe effect of the COVID-19 pandemic will not be fully reflected in our results of operations and overall financial performance until future periods. In addition, our consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, establishing allowances for doubtful accounts, assessing the recoverability of prepaid assets, including trade shows and other marketing events impacted by the pandemic, determining useful lives for finite-lived assets, assessing the recoverability of long-lived assets, determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, accounting for income taxes and related valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, valuing stock-based awards, recognizing revenue and the estimate for sales returns and upgrades, determining the amortization period for capitalized commissions and assessing the accounting treatment for commitments and contingencies. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and makes estimates based on historical experience and various other considerations that are believed to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAddition of New MSPs\nOur ability to attract new partners will depend on a number of factors, including the effectiveness of our pricing and products, offerings of our competitors, the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, and the growth of the MSP market. We believe there is\nsubstantial opportunity to increase our penetration among MSPs. We intend to drive new partner acquisition by continuing to invest significantly in sales and marketing to identify and engage prospective partners and to extend the awareness of our brand as a trusted partner to the MSP community. We believe our singular dedication to the MSP channel and our solutions that are purpose-built to meet the needs of MSPs differentiates us in the marketplace. We intend to continue to grow the number of sales representatives to qualify and close new partner opportunities. In addition, we intend to continue investing in marketing programs, events and content to drive brand awareness, generate leads and cultivate the broader MSP ecosystem. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 17,000 MSP partners, a net increase of approximately 400 since December 31, 2019 and 2,600 since December 31, 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the number of MSP partners declined, reflecting the churn of certain smaller MSPs resulting in part from the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related payment issues.\nSales Expansion Within Our Existing Partner Base\nOur ability to expand sales within our existing partner base will depend on a number of factors, including their satisfaction with our solutions and support, competition, the effectiveness of the business development tools we provide to our partners and the ability of our partners to grow their sales. Our large base of partners represents a significant opportunity for further sales expansion. Once an MSP has become our partner, we aim to grow alongside them as they increase penetration of our solutions across their existing SMB partner base, attract additional SMB customers, upgrade service tiers and adopt additional Datto solutions. We have a strong track record of growth from our existing base as evidenced by our history of partner cohort expansion and our dollar-based net retention rate, which was 111% and 119% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We intend to continue to invest in MSP self-service procurement tools to further enable a frictionless purchasing process, grow the number of sales representatives to facilitate increased partner adoption of our solutions and invest in enabling our partners\u2019 sales teams through our marketing automation platform, programs, content, training and certifications for MSPs. As of December 31, 2020, over 1,100 of our MSP partners contributed ARR of $100,000 or more, up from 950 as of December 31, 2019 and 700 as of December 31, 2018.\nInnovation and Introduction of New Platform Solutions\nOur continued growth is dependent upon our ability to sustain innovation in order to maintain a competitive advantage. We recognize that the pace of technological innovation is accelerating and that we need to continue to innovate to maintain our product differentiation. We continually invest in improving our existing solutions and creating new mission-critical solutions to anticipate the evolving IT demands of MSPs and their SMB customers. In addition, we intend to evaluate strategic investments in businesses and technologies to drive product and market expansion. For example, in July 2020 we acquired Gluh Pty. Ltd., an Australia-based company which offers a real-time quoting platform that enables MSPs to simplify the procurement of IT products and services for their end customers.\nExpansion of Our International Footprint\nOur international growth in any region will depend on our ability to effectively implement our business processes and go-to-market strategy, our ability to adapt to market or cultural differences, the competitive landscape, the maturity and growth trajectory of the MSP market and our brand awareness and perception. We believe there is significant opportunity to expand internationally. For both 2020 and 2019, our international revenue was approximately 27% of our total revenue. We intend to continue to make significant investments in international markets, particularly in EMEA and APAC. This may include investing in additional sales and marketing personnel, localizing product offerings and marketing content, and adding new data-center or office locations. Although these investments may adversely affect our operating results in the near term, we believe they will contribute to our long-term growth.\nKey Performance Metrics\nIn addition to our GAAP financial information, we review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions.\nMSP Partners\nThe number of MSP partners represents the number of MSPs with active subscriptions as of the end of the period. We use this number to assess our ability to attract and retain MSP partners and thereby grow our business. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 17,000 MSP partners, a net increase of approximately 400 since December 31, 2019 and 2,600 since December 31, 2018. Net changes in the number of our MSP partners are a result of the total new partners added during a period, largely based on our sales and marketing efforts, and the churn or reduction of existing partners during the period, which can be affected by the broader economic environment and factors such as the effects of COVID-19 on our partners' SMB end customers. As a result of our land-and-expand model, our revenue growth is driven principally by additional revenue from existing MSP partners. We view new MSP partner additions as a leading indicator of the health of the business, but the additions do not immediately drive material revenue growth in our reported results of\noperations. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the number of MSP partners declined, reflecting the churn of certain smaller MSPs resulting in part from the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related payment issues.\nAnnual Run-Rate Revenue\nWe define annual run-rate revenue, or ARR, as the annualized value of all subscription agreements as of the end of a period. We calculate ARR by multiplying the monthly run-rate revenue for the last month of a period by 12. Monthly run-rate revenue is calculated by aggregating monthly subscription values during the final month of the reporting period from both long-term and month-to-month subscriptions. ARR only includes the annualized value of subscription contracts and excludes any one-time revenue for devices or professional services. ARR mitigates fluctuations resulting from seasonality and contract term. ARR does not have any standardized meaning and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the date used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our MSP partners.\nThe table below sets forth our ARR as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:\nAs of December 31,\n(in millions) 2020 2019 2018\nARR $ 542.8 $ 474.8 $ 379.2\nARR includes run-rate revenue values from month-to-month subscription contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 39% of our total revenue and 42% of our subscription revenue was derived from month-to-month contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 31% of our total revenue and 35% of our subscription revenue was derived from month-to-month contracts. The increase in percent of total revenue and subscription revenue from month-to-month contracts primarily resulted from adding fewer long-term contracts during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prior year period, while other existing contracts completed their initial term and rolled to month-to-month contracts thereafter.\nOur dollar-based gross retention rate as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, was approximately 88%. Our dollar-based gross retention rate reflects ARR losses from subscription cancellations, reductions in service levels or seat counts and non-renewals, and does not reflect any ARR expansion. We calculate our dollar-based gross retention rate as of the period end by starting with the ARR from the last day of the period one year prior, or Prior Period ARR. We then deduct from the Prior Period ARR any (i) ARR attrition from MSP partners who are no longer partners as of the last day of the period, and (ii) ARR compression from MSP partners whose subscriptions are at a lower value as of the last day of the period, or Remaining ARR. We then divide the Remaining ARR by the Prior Period ARR to arrive at our dollar-based gross retention rate, which is the percentage of ARR from all MSP partners as of the year prior that is not lost to partner churn or subscription compression. Given the meaningful percentage of our subscription revenue derived from month-to-month contracts, the approximately 88% dollar-based gross retention rate demonstrates that a large majority of our MSP partners continue to renew their subscription contracts, whether on a month-to-month or longer term basis. Based on our experience, we do not believe month-to-month contracts experience significantly higher attrition than longer-term subscription contracts.\nDollar-Based Net Retention Rate\nTo evaluate the efficacy of our land-and-expand business model, we examine the rate at which our partners increase their subscriptions for our solutions which result in changes to ARR. Our dollar-based net retention rate measures our ability to increase ARR across our existing partner base through expanded use of our platform, offset by MSP partners whose subscription contracts with us are not renewed or are renewed at a lower amount.\nWe calculate our dollar-based net retention rate as of the end of a reporting period as a quotient of the following:\n\u2022Denominator: ARR as of the last day of the prior year comparative reporting period.\n\u2022Numerator: ARR as of the last day of the current reporting period from partners with associated ARR as of the last day of the prior year comparative reporting period.\nThe quotient obtained from this calculation is our dollar-based net retention rate. We believe our ability to grow alongside our MSP partners as they deploy our solutions to more SMBs, and to cross-sell additional solutions, will continue to support our high dollar-based net retention rate.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our dollar-based net retention rate was 111% and 119%, respectively.\nBecause existing MSP partners drive the vast majority of our revenue growth in any given year, we believe our revenue growth is strongly correlated to our dollar-based net retention rate.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from fees received for subscriptions to our products and services, and also from the sale of BCDR and Networking devices and professional services associated with our Business Management offerings.\nSubscription. We derive revenue primarily from cloud-based software and technology solutions sold on a recurring subscription basis. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription term after all revenue recognition criteria have been met. We generally invoice subscription agreements monthly in advance over the subscription period or monthly in arrears based on usage. Subscription revenue for our Unified Continuity and Networking solutions grows as the end-customers, managed by our MSP partners, add new subscription products, upgrade the service tier of their existing subscription products or increase the usage of their subscription products. Revenue from our Business Management solutions increases with the addition of employees of our MSP partners who require seat licenses, the proliferation of end-user devices managed by those MSPs and the expansion of products used by those MSPs to manage their SMB customers\u2019 IT infrastructures.\nDevice. Our device revenue is derived from the sale of devices in conjunction with subscription solutions. Device revenue includes the sale of BCDR and Networking devices which enable us to deliver our BCDR and Networking services to our MSP partners under a recurring subscription model. Revenue from devices in our Unified Continuity solution primarily consists of the sale of our proprietary data storage devices. Revenue from devices in our Networking solution primarily consists of the sale of wireless access points, switches, edge routers and managed power. We recognize revenue at a point in time when control of the device has transferred to the MSP. Revenue from devices does not contribute significantly to overall revenue related to our Unified Continuity solutions.\nProfessional services and other. We derive revenue from professional services associated with our Business Management offerings. These implementation and consulting services include configuration, database merging and data migration. Our professional services are generally priced on a time and materials basis and invoiced monthly with revenue recognized as the services are performed and we frequently discount our services to drive adoption of our business management offerings.\nCost of revenue\nSubscription. Subscription cost of revenue consists of costs directly related to our subscription services, including personnel costs related to operating our data centers and customer support operations, hosting and data center related costs, third-party software licenses and allocated facilities and overhead costs associated with delivering these services.\nDevice. Device cost of revenue consists of hardware, manufacturing, shipping and logistics, personnel costs and allocated facilities and overhead costs associated with delivering our devices. Our Unified Continuity products rely on a mix of off-the-shelf hardware and custom designed hardware. Our Networking devices generally consist of off-the-shelf hardware, although some of our devices feature a unique industrial design.\nProfessional services and other. Professional services and other cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel costs and allocated facilities and overhead associated with delivering implementation and consulting services. Our professional services implementations aim to ensure higher software utilization, greater upsell opportunity and lower churn over time.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization cost of revenue consists of depreciation of our Datto Cloud infrastructure and amortization of our acquired technology intangible assets.\nGross profit and gross margin\nGross profit, or revenue less cost of revenue, has been, and will continue to be, affected by various factors, including revenue fluctuations, the mix of revenue and the timing and amount of investments to expand our Datto Cloud infrastructure.\nOperating expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and amortization of internally developed software, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, sales commissions, payroll taxes and stock-based compensation expense. Other significant components of operating expenses include events and travel, professional fees, allocated facilities and overhead costs, general marketing and promotion costs, payment processing fees and bad debt expense.\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, costs for events and travel, costs of marketing and promotional activities, payment processing fees and allocated facilities and overhead costs. Sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period because of the timing and extent of marketing activities, trade shows, and events including DattoCon and DattoCon EMEA, as well as the timing of amortization of sales commissions and stock-based compensation expense.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, third-party professional fees and allocated facilities and overhead costs. Research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period because of the timing and extent of our investments in research and development activities, as well as the timing of stock-based compensation expense.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs across the corporate functions of executive, finance, human resources, information technology, internal operations and legal, as well as third-party professional fees, bad debt expense, travel and allocated costs for facilities. Following the completion of our IPO we began incurring additional general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including increased expenses for insurance, costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, investor relations and professional services expenses, and increased stock-based compensation expense.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses in operating expenses consist of amortization of tradenames and partner relationship intangibles as well as depreciation of other property and equipment such as leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and computer equipment as well as amortization of internally developed software.\nOther expense\nInterest expense\nInterest expense consists primarily of interest payments on outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. In conjunction with our IPO, we repaid all amounts outstanding under our 2019 Credit Agreement. We also entered into the 2020 Credit Agreement, which provides a $200.0 million revolving credit facility. No amounts were drawn under the 2020 Credit Agreement. See \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources-Credit Facilities\u201d for additional details.\nOther (income) expense\nOther (income) expense primarily consists of the net exchange (gains) or losses on foreign currency transactions and (gains) or losses on the disposal of assets.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nLoss on extinguishment of debt reflects the loss incurred in conjunction with the termination of our credit facilities in both 2020 and 2019. See \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources-Credit Facilities\u201d for additional details.\n(Benefit from) provision for income tax\n(Benefit from) provision for income tax consists primarily of income taxes related to U.S. federal and state income taxes and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is recorded based upon the functional role of the holder. Stock-based compensation expense for awards which contained only a time-based vesting condition was recorded in all periods presented. However, stock-based compensation expense for awards which contained both a time-based and a performance-based vesting condition, which was the closing of an IPO, commenced during the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result of our IPO.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for the period indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nRevenue:\nSubscription $ 485,326 $ 412,167 $ 333,397\nDevice 30,202 44,052 50,514\nProfessional services and other 3,257 2,533 3,444\nTotal revenue 518,785 458,752 387,355\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription(1)\n84,463 82,066 72,498\nDevice(1)\n37,607 53,933 50,813\nProfessional services and other(1)\n6,244 5,563 3,637\nDepreciation and amortization 21,890 15,745 12,923\nTotal cost of revenue 150,204 157,307 139,871\nGross profit 368,581 301,445 247,484\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing(1)\n115,790 110,441 98,183\nResearch and development(1)\n78,932 60,459 54,017\nGeneral and administrative(1)\n85,668 73,903 57,913\nDepreciation and amortization 27,223 27,417 28,953\nTotal operating expenses 307,613 272,220 239,066\nIncome from operations 60,968 29,225 8,418\nOther expense:\nInterest expense 25,348 43,437 55,380\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 8,488 19,231 -\nOther (income) expense, net (3,428) 256 802\nTotal other expense 30,408 62,924 56,182\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 30,560 (33,699) (47,764)\n(Provision for) benefit from income tax (8,062) 2,511 10,041\nNet income (loss) $ 22,498 $ (31,188) $ (37,723)\n(1)Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue-subscription $ 4,092 $ 98 $ 140\nCost of revenue-device 203 - -\nCost of revenue-professional services and other 418 - -\nSelling and marketing 6,614 2,946 764\nResearch and development 13,590 3,510 1,020\nGeneral and administrative 8,543 5,661 2,211\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 33,460 $ 12,215 $ 4,135\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the period indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nRevenue:\nSubscription 93.6 % 89.8 % 86.1 %\nDevice 5.8 % 9.6 % 13.0 %\nProfessional services and other 0.6 % 0.6 % 0.9 %\nTotal revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription 16.3 % 17.9 % 18.7 %\nDevice 7.2 % 11.8 % 13.1 %\nProfessional services and other 1.2 % 1.2 % 0.9 %\nDepreciation and amortization 4.2 % 3.4 % 3.3 %\nTotal cost of revenue 29.0 % 34.3 % 36.1 %\nGross profit 71.0 % 65.7 % 63.9 %\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 22.3 % 24.1 % 25.3 %\nResearch and development 15.2 % 13.2 % 13.9 %\nGeneral and administrative 16.5 % 16.1 % 15.0 %\nDepreciation and amortization 5.2 % 5.9 % 7.5 %\nTotal operating expenses 59.3 % 59.3 % 61.7 %\nIncome from operations 11.8 % 6.4 % 2.2 %\nOther expense:\nInterest expense 4.9 % 9.4 % 14.3 %\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 1.6 % 4.2 % - %\nOther (income) expense, net (0.7) % 0.1 % 0.2 %\nTotal other expense 5.9 % 13.7 % 14.5 %\nIncome (loss) before income taxes 5.9 % (7.3) % (12.3) %\n(Provision for) benefit from income tax (1.6) % 0.5 % 2.6 %\nNet income (loss) 4.3 % (6.8) % (9.7) %\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenue\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nRevenue:\nSubscription $ 485,326 $ 412,167 $ 73,159 17.7 %\nDevice 30,202 44,052 (13,850) (31.4) %\nProfessional services and other 3,257 2,533 724 28.6 %\nTotal revenue $ 518,785 $ 458,752 $ 60,033 13.1 %\nSubscription\nSubscription revenue increased $73.2 million, or 17.7%, for 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in subscription revenue was driven by increased sales across all of our Unified Continuity, Business Management and Networking cloud-based offerings. Recurring subscription revenue accounted for 94% of total revenue for 2020 compared to 90% for 2019.\nDevice\nDevice revenue decreased $13.9 million, or 31.4%, for 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to a lower volume of devices sold, partly as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a lower volume of new subscriptions and thus a lower volume of BCDR and networking devices, as well as an impact of approximately $1.8 million from our shift in early 2019 from selling a broader range of networking devices on a one-time basis to packaging networking devices with cloud-based management software and services with lower upfront costs and a recurring subscription.\nProfessional services and other\nProfessional services and other revenue increased $0.7 million, or 28.6%, for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily as a result of additional implementations of our cloud-based Business Management offerings.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription $ 84,463 $ 82,066 $ 2,397 2.9 %\nDevice 37,607 53,933 (16,326) (30.3) %\nProfessional services and other 6,244 5,563 681 12.2 %\nDepreciation and amortization 21,890 15,745 6,145 39.0 %\nTotal cost of revenue $ 150,204 $ 157,307 $ (7,103) (4.5) %\nSubscription\nSubscription cost of revenue increased $2.4 million, or 2.9%, for 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by additional costs to support the growth of our subscription offerings, including increased personnel costs, including significantly higher stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO, partially offset by increased efficiencies in the costs to provide our Unified Continuity solutions. Restructuring costs of $0.5 million related to our reduction in workforce were recorded in 2020. Subscription cost of revenue reflects stock-based compensation expense of $4.1 million and $0.1 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDevice\nDevice cost of revenue decreased $16.3 million, or 30.3% for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by the lower volume of devices sold in 2020, partly as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a lower volume of new subscriptions and thus a lower volume of BCDR and networking devices. In addition, the decrease was driven by greater inventory write offs in 2019 and the impact of approximately $1.1 million from our shift in early 2019 from selling a broader range of networking devices on a one-time basis to packaging networking devices with cloud-based management software and services with lower upfront costs and a recurring subscription. Device cost of revenue reflects stock-based compensation expense of $0.2 million during 2020. There was no stock-based compensation expense recorded in 2019.\nProfessional services and other\nProfessional services and other cost of revenue increased $0.7 million, or 12.2% for 2020 compared to 2019, driven by growth in employee and related costs in our professional services organization, including stock-based compensation expense as a result of our IPO. Restructuring costs of $0.1 million related to our reduction in workforce were recorded in 2020. Professional services and other cost of revenue reflects stock-based compensation expense of $0.4 million during 2020. There was no stock-based compensation expense recorded in 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue increased $6.1 million for 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was attributable primarily to higher depreciation expense in 2020 associated with the continued capital expenditures for our Datto Cloud infrastructure to support the growth in subscriptions. Depreciation expense was $16.9 million and $11.0 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and amortization of intangible assets was $5.0 million and $4.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nGross profit:\nSubscription $ 400,863 $ 330,101 $ 70,762 21.4 %\nDevice (7,405) (9,881) 2,476 (25.1) %\nProfessional services and other (2,987) (3,030) 43 (1.4) %\nDepreciation and amortization (21,890) (15,745) (6,145) 39.0 %\nTotal gross profit $ 368,581 $ 301,445 $ 67,136 22.3 %\nGross margin:\nSubscription 82.6 % 80.1 %\nDevice (24.5) % (22.4) %\nProfessional services and other (91.7) % (119.6) %\nTotal gross margin 71.0 % 65.7 %\nOur gross profit increased $67.1 million, or 22.3%, and our gross margin increased by 534 basis points for 2020 as compared to 2019, driven by growth in subscription revenue and to a lesser extent by the reduction in device cost of revenue, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense associated with our ongoing data center expansions, higher stock-based compensation expense of $4.6 million and $0.6 million of restructuring costs related to our reduction in workforce.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing $ 115,790 $ 110,441 $ 5,349 4.8 %\nResearch and development 78,932 60,459 18,473 30.6 %\nGeneral and administrative 85,668 73,903 11,765 15.9 %\nDepreciation and amortization 27,223 27,417 (194) (0.7) %\nTotal operating expenses $ 307,613 $ 272,220 $ 35,393 13.0 %\nAs a percentage of total revenue\nSales and marketing 22.3 % 24.1 %\nResearch and development 15.2 % 13.2 %\nGeneral and administrative 16.5 % 16.1 %\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expense increased $5.3 million, or 4.8%, for 2020 compared to 2019, driven by increased personnel costs, including increased stock-based compensation expense of $3.7 million as a result of our IPO and costs related to our workforce reduction of $1.9 million, and higher payment processing fees resulting from higher revenues. The increases were partially offset by lower marketing, travel and events costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the cancellation of DattoCon and DattoCon EMEA in 2020. Sales and marketing expense included $6.6 million and $2.9 million of stock-based compensation expense for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expense increased $18.5 million, or 30.6%, for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by increases in personnel costs, including increased stock-based compensation expense of $10.1 million as a result of our IPO and costs related to our workforce reduction of $0.9 million, partially offset by lower travel costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Research and development expense included $13.6 million and $3.5 million of stock-based compensation expense for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $11.8 million, or 15.9%, for 2020 compared to 2019, driven primarily by increased personnel costs, including increased stock-based compensation expense of $2.9 million as a result of our IPO and costs related to our\nworkforce reduction of $0.4 million, increased public company insurance costs, transaction related and other costs, comprised of $2.2 million related to public company readiness and acquisition costs, and $1.0 million of expense resulting from the decision to discontinue development of a back-office system. The increased costs were partially offset by lower travel and other costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. General and administrative expense included $8.5 million and $5.7 million of stock-based compensation expense for 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to operating expenses for 2020 was consistent with 2019. Amortization of intangible assets was $17.7 million and $17.9 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and depreciation expense was $9.5 million for both 2020 and 2019.\nOther Expenses\nInterest expense\nInterest expense of $25.3 million reflects a decrease of $18.1 million, or 41.6%, for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily as a result of lower interest rates in 2020 and the repayment of all outstanding debt with the proceeds from our IPO in October, partially offset by increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility during the first quarter of 2020 in order to strengthen our cash position and maintain flexibility given the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic. In conjunction with the IPO, we terminated our 2019 Credit Agreement and entered into the 2020 Credit Agreement. No amounts were drawn under the 2020 Credit Agreement and we have no outstanding debt as of December 31, 2020.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nA loss on extinguishment of debt of $8.5 million was recorded in 2020 as a result of our debt refinancing which took place in conjunction with our IPO. A loss on extinguishment of debt of $19.2 million was recorded in 2019 as a result of our debt refinancing in April 2019.\nOther (income) expense, net\nOther (income) expense, net primarily relates to the impact of net exchange gains or losses on foreign currency balances, principally related to intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies.\n(Provision for) benefit from income tax\nWe recorded a provision for income tax of $8.1 million for 2020, as we generated taxable income, as compared to a benefit from income tax of $2.5 million in 2019, as we generated a taxable loss. The effective tax rate for 2020 compared to 2019 was 26.4% and 7.5%, respectively. The effective tax rate increased primarily as a result of generating taxable income in 2020, as the realizability of certain taxable losses was limited in 2019.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nRevenue\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2018 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nRevenue:\nSubscription $ 412,167 $ 333,397 $ 78,770 23.6 %\nDevice 44,052 50,514 (6,462) (12.8) %\nProfessional services and other 2,533 3,444 (911) (26.5) %\nTotal revenue $ 458,752 $ 387,355 $ 71,397 18.4 %\nSubscription\nSubscription revenue increased $78.8 million, or 23.6% for 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in subscription revenue was primarily driven by increased sales of our Unified Continuity and Business Management cloud-based offerings, as well as increased sales of SaaS offerings related to our Networking devices.\nDevice\nDevice revenue decreased $6.5 million, or 12.8% for 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily attributable to our shift from selling networking devices on a one-time basis at a substantial upfront cost to packaging networking devices with cloud-based management software and services with lower upfront costs and a recurring subscription.\nProfessional services and other\nProfessional services and other revenue decreased $0.9 million, or 26.5% for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily as a result of offering increased discounts on our professional services to encourage the adoption (and subsequent renewal) of our cloud-based Business Management offerings.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2018 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue:\nSubscription $ 82,066 $ 72,498 $ 9,568 13.2 %\nDevice 53,933 50,813 3,120 6.1 %\nProfessional services and other 5,563 3,637 1,926 53.0 %\nDepreciation and amortization 15,745 12,923 2,822 21.8 %\nTotal cost of revenue $ 157,307 $ 139,871 $ 17,436 12.5 %\nSubscription\nSubscription cost of revenue increased $9.6 million, or 13.2%, for 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily driven by additional costs to support the growth of our SaaS subscription offerings, including increased staffing levels and increased hosting and data center costs for our Datto Cloud infrastructure.\nDevice\nDevice cost of revenue increased $3.1 million, or 6.1% for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily as a result of inventory write offs for defective and unsalable inventory, as we determined certain inventory components were not functional.\nProfessional services and other\nProfessional services and other cost of revenue increased $1.9 million, or 53.0% for 2019 compared to 2018, driven by growth in employee and related costs in our professional services organization to help ensure that MSP partners successfully deploy and adopt our Business Management cloud-based offerings.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue increased $2.8 million for 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was attributable primarily to additional capital expenditures for our Datto Cloud infrastructure to support the growth in subscriptions.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2018 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nGross profit:\nSubscription $ 330,101 $ 260,899 $ 69,202 26.5 %\nDevice (9,881) (299) (9,582) NM\nProfessional services and other (3,030) (193) (2,837) NM\nDepreciation and amortization (15,745) (12,923) (2,822) 21.8 %\nTotal gross profit $ 301,445 $ 247,484 $ 53,961 21.8 %\nGross margin:\nSubscription 80.1 % 78.3 %\nDevice (22.4) % (0.6) %\nProfessional services and other (119.6) % (5.6) %\nTotal gross margin 65.7 % 63.9 %\nNM - percentage change is not meaningful\nOur gross profit increased $54.0 million, or 21.8%, and our gross margin increased by 180 basis points for 2019 compared to 2018, driven by growth in subscription revenue. Gross profit for device and professional services and other decreased from 2018 primarily as a result of discounts offered in conjunction with our strategy to decrease the upfront price paid for our devices in order to secure recurring subscriptions and the investment in our professional services organization.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019 2018 $ Change % Change\n(in thousands)\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing $ 110,441 $ 98,183 $ 12,258 12.5 %\nResearch and development 60,459 54,017 6,442 11.9 %\nGeneral and administrative 73,903 57,913 15,990 27.6 %\nDepreciation and amortization 27,417 28,953 (1,536) (5.3) %\nTotal operating expenses $ 272,220 $ 239,066 $ 33,154 13.9 %\nAs a percentage of total revenue\nSales and marketing 24.1 % 25.3 %\nResearch and development 13.2 % 13.9 %\nGeneral and administrative 16.1 % 15.0 %\nSales and marketing\nSales and marketing expense increased $12.3 million, or 12.5%, for 2019 compared to 2018, driven by an increase in employee and related costs resulting from additional staffing and increased commissions as a result of the increase in revenue, as well as an increase in payment processing fees related to higher sales volume. These increases were partially offset by modestly lower advertising and promotion expenses. Sales and marketing expense included $2.9 million and $0.8 million of stock-based compensation expense for 2019 compared to 2018, respectively.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expense increased $6.4 million, or 11.9%, for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily as a result of an increase in employee and related costs because of increased staffing levels. Research and development expense included $3.5 million and $1.0 million of stock-based compensation expense for 2019 compared to 2018, respectively.\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $16.0 million, or 27.6%, for 2019 compared to 2018, driven primarily by an increase in professional fees and expenses for billing and financial systems to improve our internal processes, as well as an increase in employee and related costs resulting from increased staffing levels. These expenses were primarily related to our preparations to become a public company. In addition, we incurred an additional $4.0 million of bad debt expense as a result of billing system conversion issues experienced in 2019 which contributed to collection challenges. General and administrative expense included $5.7 million and $2.2 million of stock-based compensation expense for 2019 compared to 2018, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense related to operating expenses decreased $1.5 million for 2019 compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by the end of the useful life of an acquired intangible asset, partially offset by an increase in depreciation for leasehold improvements and additions of computer equipment to support increased staffing levels.\nOther Expenses\nInterest expense\nInterest expense decreased $11.9 million, or 21.6%, for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily as a result of the lower interest rate from our debt refinancing in April 2019.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nA loss on extinguishment of debt of $19.2 million was recorded in conjunction with our debt refinancing in April 2019, which included a prepayment penalty of $10.4 million and the write-off of deferred financing costs of $8.8 million.\nOther expense (income), net\nOther expense, net decreased $0.5 million primarily because of net exchange (gains) or losses on foreign currency transactions and decreased losses on the disposal of assets.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the non-GAAP measures of Non-GAAP Gross Profit, Non-GAAP Income from Operations, Non-GAAP Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We believe that non-GAAP financial information may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit is a supplemental measure of operating performance that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and that does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to gross profit, as determined in accordance with GAAP. We define Non-GAAP Gross Profit as gross profit, adjusted for amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring expense. We use Non-GAAP Gross Profit to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. We believe Non-GAAP Gross Profit is a useful measure to us and to our investors to assist in evaluating our core operating performance because it provides consistency and direct comparability with our past financial performance and between fiscal periods, as the metric eliminates the effects of variability of stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired technology intangible assets, which are non-cash expenses that may fluctuate for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance, as well as restructuring expense, which is infrequent in nature. While the amortization expense of\nacquired technology intangible assets is excluded from Non-GAAP Gross Profit, the revenue related to acquired technology intangible assets is reflected in Non-GAAP Gross Profit as these assets contribute to our revenue generation. Non-GAAP Gross Profit has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, Non-GAAP Gross Profit should not be considered as a replacement for gross profit, as determined by GAAP, or as a measure of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. Our presentation of Non-GAAP Gross Profit should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by the types of items excluded from the calculation of Non-GAAP Gross Profit. Non-GAAP Gross Profit is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP and the use of the term may vary from other companies.\nA reconciliation of Non-GAAP Gross Profit to gross profit, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nGross profit $ 368,581 $ 301,445 $ 247,484\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 5,023 4,700 4,994\nStock-based compensation expense 4,713 98 140\nRestructuring expense(1)\n601 - -\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit $ 378,918 $ 306,243 $ 252,618\n(1) Restructuring expense primarily relates to severance costs incurred in connection with a reduction in workforce undertaken in Q2 2020 to align our cost structure to expectations of potentially reduced revenue resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately $0.6 million of restructuring expense was recorded within cost of revenue for 2020.\nNon-GAAP Income from Operations\nNon-GAAP Income from Operations is a supplemental measure of operating performance that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and that does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to income from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. We define Non-GAAP Income from Operations as income from operations, adjusted for amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation, restructuring expense and transaction related and other expense. We use Non-GAAP Income from Operations to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. We believe that Non-GAAP Income from Operations facilitates comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis between periods, and when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, helps provide a broader picture of factors and trends affecting our results of operations. While the amortization expense of acquired technology,partner relationships and tradenames is excluded from Non-GAAP Income from Operations, the revenue related to acquired technology, partner relationships and tradenames is reflected in Non-GAAP Income from Operations as these assets contribute to our revenue generation. Non-GAAP Income from Operations has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, Non-GAAP Income from Operations should not be considered as a replacement for operating income, as determined by GAAP, or as a measure of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. Our presentation of Non-GAAP Income from Operations should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by the types of items excluded from the calculation of Non-GAAP Income from Operations. Non-GAAP Income from Operations is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP and the use of the term may vary from other companies.\nA reconciliation of Non-GAAP Income from Operations to income from operations, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nIncome from operations $ 60,968 $ 29,225 $ 8,418\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets 22,679 22,600 25,481\nStock-based compensation expense 33,460 12,215 4,135\nRestructuring expense(1)\n3,835 - -\nTransaction related and other expense(2)\n3,112 - -\nNon-GAAP Income from Operations $ 124,054 $ 64,040 $ 38,034\n(1)Restructuring expense primarily relates to severance costs incurred in connection with a reduction in workforce undertaken in Q2 2020 to align our cost structure to expectations of potentially reduced revenue resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately $3.2 million and $0.6 million of restructuring expense was recorded within operating expenses and cost of revenue, respectively, for 2020.\n(2)Transaction related and other expense primarily relates to costs incurred to support our public company readiness, acquisition costs, as well as costs related to a decision to discontinue development of a back-office system.\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss)\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) is a supplemental measure of operating performance that is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and that does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP. We define Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) as net income (loss) before income taxes, adjusted for loss on extinguishment of debt, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense, and transaction related and other expense. The Company utilizes a normalized non-GAAP tax rate to provide better consistency across the reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring and period-specific items, which can vary in size and frequency, and which are not necessarily indicative of the Company\u2019s long-term operations. The normalized non-GAAP tax rate applied to each period presented was 25%. We use Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans. We believe that Non-GAAP Net Income facilitates comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis between periods, and when viewed in combination with our results prepared in accordance with GAAP, helps provide a broader picture of factors and trends affecting our results of operations. While the amortization expense of acquired technology, partner relationships and tradenames is excluded from Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss), the revenue related to acquired technology, partner relationships and tradenames is reflected in Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) as these assets contribute to our revenue generation. Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) should not be considered as a replacement for net income (loss), as determined by GAAP, or as a measure of our profitability. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures only for supplemental purposes. Our presentation of Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by the types of items excluded from the calculation of Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss).

The Company may adjust its non-GAAP tax rate as additional information becomes available or events occur which may materially affect this rate, including impacts from the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic mix, merger and acquisition activity, or changes in our business outlook.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of operating performance monitored by management that is not defined under GAAP and that does not represent, and should not be considered as, an alternative to net income (loss), as determined by GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for interest and other expense, net, loss on extinguishment of debt, depreciation and amortization, (provision for) benefit from income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense and transaction related and other expense. We use Adjusted EBITDA to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends and to develop short-term and long-term operating plans.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income (loss) and our other GAAP results. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by the types of items excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP and the use of the term may vary from other companies.\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nNet income (loss) $ 22,498 $ (31,188) $ (37,723)\nInterest and other expense, net(1)\n21,920 43,693 56,182\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 8,488 19,231 -\nDepreciation and amortization 49,113 43,162 41,876\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes 8,062 (2,511) (10,041)\nStock-based compensation expense 33,460 12,215 4,135\nRestructuring expense(2)\n3,835 - -\nTransaction related and other expense(3)\n3,112 - -\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 150,488 $ 84,602 $ 54,429\n(1) Interest and other expense, net includes interest expense, net, foreign currency gains and losses and other expenses.\n(2)Restructuring expense primarily relates to severance costs incurred in connection with a reduction in workforce undertaken in Q2 2020 to align our cost structure to expectations of potentially reduced revenue resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately $3.2 million and $0.6 million of restructuring expense was recorded within operating expenses and cost of revenue, respectively, for 2020.\n(3)Transaction related and other expense primarily relates to costs incurred to support our public company readiness, acquisition costs, as well as costs related to a decision to discontinue development of a back-office system.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nAs of December 31, 2020, our balance of cash and restricted cash totaled $170.4 million, as compared to $29.1 million as of December 31, 2019. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had no debt outstanding and $198.1 million of capacity under our 2020 Revolving Credit Agreement (defined below), as compared to principal balances outstanding under our 2019 Credit Agreement of $562.3 million as of December 31, 2019. We believe our existing cash and cash provided by our ongoing operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months.\nHistorically, as we invested in our organization and infrastructure to meet increasing demand for our products and services and to drive our rapid growth we have financed our operations primarily through cash received from operations and debt financing. During 2020, in response to the spread of COVID-19 and its impacts on the world economy, we undertook various measures to improve our liquidity position and match our cost structure to our revenue and cash generation activities. In the first quarter of 2020, we drew down the remaining available balance of $32.1 million under our 2019 Revolving Credit Facility for working capital purposes, as well as to strengthen our cash position and maintain flexibility. We also took measures to reduce expenses, including a reduction in workforce in May 2020, and deferred certain capital projects. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a reduction of marketing, event and travel costs, including the cancellation of DattoCon and DattoCon EMEA in 2020. We also elected to defer payment of our obligation for social security tax for the remainder of 2020 as provided in the CARES Act, resulting in a reduction in cash outflows of $5.8 million during 2020. These actions combined to increase cash provided by operating activities for 2020 to $108.7 million, as compared to $11.2 million for 2019. In the future we will continue to invest in our organization and infrastructure and expect to resume hosting our world-class partner events in-person as we continue to grow and innovate along with our MSP partners.\nOn October 23, 2020, we closed our IPO through which we issued and sold 22,000,000 shares of common stock at a price per share of $27.00. We received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $558.0 million from the IPO, after deducting the underwriting discount of $36.0 million. Shortly after closing the IPO, the Company utilized the IPO proceeds and $38.4 million of available cash to repay the outstanding balances under the 2019 Credit Agreement of $590.2 million, pay $1.6 million of related accrued interest, and pay $1.2 million in debt issuance costs for the 2020 Credit Agreement. In addition, on November 3, 2020, the underwriters exercised their option in full to purchase 3,300,000 additional shares of common stock at a price of $27.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $83.6 million, after deducting the underwriting discount of $5.4 million. The total net proceeds from the IPO, after deducting the underwriters discount, were $641.6 million. In addition, we paid $5.3 million in IPO costs through December 31, 2020.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on several factors, including but not limited to, our subscription revenue growth rate and the need to invest in our Datto Cloud infrastructure to support such growth, the timing of cash receipts and payments, the timing and extent of spending to support research and development, the pace of expansion of sales and marketing activities, including in international markets, the level of investment in back-office infrastructure, and the cost to operate as a public company. In the future, we may also enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services and technologies, including intellectual property rights.\nWe may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing to meet our future capital requirements. In the event additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to fund the expansion of our operations and invest in new technologies, this could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations.\nCredit Facilities\nOn October 23, 2020, Datto, Inc., as borrower (the \u201cBorrower\u201d), Merritt Holdco, Inc., Autotask Superior Holding, Inc., Backupify, Inc., Autotask Corporation, Open Mesh, Inc. and SoonR, Inc., each a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Datto Holding Corp., entered into a credit agreement (the \u201c2020 Credit Agreement\u201d) with the lenders party thereto and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent. The 2020 Credit Agreement is guaranteed by Merritt Holdco, Inc., Autotask Superior Holding, Inc., Backupify, Inc., Open Mesh, Inc., Autotask Corporation, and SoonR, Inc. (the \u201cGuarantors,\u201d and, together with the Borrower, the \u201cLoan Parties\u201d) and is supported by a security interest in substantially all of the Loan Parties\u2019 personal property and assets, subject to customary exceptions.\nThe 2020 Credit Agreement provides for an initial $200.0 million in commitments for revolving credit loans, which may be increased or decreased under specific circumstances, with a $40.0 million letter of credit sublimit and a $100 million alternative currency sublimit (the \u201c2020 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). In addition, the 2020 Credit Agreement provides for the ability of the Borrower to request incremental term loan facilities. Borrowings pursuant to the 2020 Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including for acquisitions permitted under the 2020 Credit Agreement.\nBorrowings under the 2020 Credit Agreement are scheduled to mature on October 23, 2025. The 2020 Credit Agreement contains certain customary events of default, which include failure to make payments when due thereunder, the material inaccuracy of representations or warranties, failure to observe or perform certain covenants, cross-defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency-related events, certain judgments, certain ERISA-related events, or a Change in Control (as defined in the 2020 Credit Agreement).\nThe 2020 Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including certain restrictions on the ability of the Loan Parties and their Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the 2020 Credit Agreement) to incur any additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness of others, to create liens on properties or assets, and to enter into certain asset and stock-based transactions. In addition, under the terms of the 2020 Credit Agreement, the Borrower's First Lien Net Leverage Ratio shall not be more than 4.00 to 1.00.\nThe interest rates applicable to the revolving borrowings under the 2020 Credit Agreement, are, at the Borrower\u2019s option, either (i) a base rate, equal to the greater of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5% or (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one month Interest Period (each term as defined in the 2020 Credit Agreement) plus 1%, or (ii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate equal to the LIBO Rate for the applicable Interest Period, plus in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), the Applicable Rate (as defined in the 2020 Credit Agreement). The Applicable Rate (i) for base rate loans range from 0.25% to 1.0% per annum and (ii) for LIBO Rate loans range from 1.25% to 2.0% per annum, in each case, based on the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2020 Credit Agreement). The Borrower will pay a commitment fee during the term of the 2020 Credit Agreement ranging from 0.20% to 0.35% per annum of the average daily undrawn portion of the revolving commitments based on the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2020 Credit Agreement).\nAny borrowings under the 2020 Credit Agreement may be repaid, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time without premium or penalty other than customary breakage costs, and any amounts repaid may be reborrowed. No mandatory prepayments will be required other than when borrowings and letter of credit usage exceed the aggregate commitment of all lenders.\nThe 2020 Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn as of December 31, 2020, with the exception of $1.9 million of outstanding letters of credit.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents a summary of our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ 108,698 $ 11,235 $ (10,559)\nNet cash used in investing activities $ (44,837) $ (38,226) $ (28,199)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities $ 75,679 $ 18,505 $ (5,182)\nOperating Activities\nFor 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $108.7 million, which resulted from net income of $22.5 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $106.8 million and net cash outflow of $20.6 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expenses of $49.1 million, stock-based compensation expense of $33.5 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $8.5 million and an increase in deferred income taxes of $7.8 million. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in other assets of $13.0 million primarily driven by an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs, as well as an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $7.5 million, primarily driven by the payment of insurance as a result of becoming a public company.\nFor 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $11.2 million, which resulted from a net loss of $31.2 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $80.2 million and net cash outflow of $37.8 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expenses of $43.2 million, loss on extinguishment of debt of $19.2 million and stock-based compensation expense of $12.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes of $6.1 million. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in other assets of $24.2 million, including a $14.9 million increase in deferred contract acquisition costs, an increase of $6.0 million in contract assets, and an increase in capitalized costs for cloud computing arrangements. In addition, accounts receivables increased $10.8 million as a result of the growth in revenue and the timing of cash receipts, which was impacted by a system conversion implemented in 2019 which contributed to collection challenges, and deferred revenue decreased $7.9 million as a result of the timing of invoicing. The increase in operating assets was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $14.8 million as a result of the timing of payments.\nFor 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $10.6 million, which resulted from a net loss of $37.7 million, adjusted for non-cash charges of $40.2 million and net cash outflow of $13.0 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization expenses of $41.9 million and stock-based compensation expense of $4.1 million, partially offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes of $11.9 million. The net cash outflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in other assets of $15.9 million related to increased deferred commission costs and capitalized costs for cloud computing arrangements, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $13.8 million as a result of the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, related primarily to the fair value assigned to deferred revenue in the formation of Datto Holding Corp. in October 2017 for the purpose of acquiring all of the capital stock of Datto, Inc. (the \u201cVista Acquisition\u201d), as well as the overall increase in revenue.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $44.8 million during 2020, primarily resulting from investment in servers for our Datto Cloud infrastructure to support our overall subscription growth. In addition, we incurred expenses for leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures to expand and update certain offices and purchased computer equipment to support our workforce and global expansion. In July 2020, we acquired two affiliated Australian entities, Gluh Pty Ltd and Keystone Software Holdings Pty Ltd, which offer a quoting tool for MSPs to quote, sell and procure IT goods and services. The amount paid was approximately $4.4 million, reflecting the purchase price of $4.0 million and certain closing adjustments.\nCash used in investing activities was $38.2 million during 2019, primarily resulting from investment in servers for our Datto Cloud infrastructure to support our overall subscription growth. In addition, we incurred expenses for leasehold improvements to expand and update certain offices and purchased computer equipment in order to support the growth in our workforce.\nCash used in investing activities was $28.2 million during 2018, primarily resulting from investment in servers for our Datto Cloud infrastructure to support our overall subscription growth. In addition, we incurred expenses for leasehold improvements to expand and update certain offices and purchased computer equipment in order to support our growth in workforce.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $75.7 million during 2020, primarily reflecting proceeds from our IPO, net of the underwriting discount, of $641.6 million, offset by debt repayments of $594.7 million, including $590.2 million to repay all outstanding balances under our 2019 Credit Agreement, payment of IPO costs of $5.3 million, and payment of debt issuance costs of $1.2 million for our 2020 Credit Agreement. In addition, proceeds from the exercise of stock options was $3.2 million.\nCash provided by financing activities was $18.5 million during 2019, primarily reflecting proceeds from borrowings under our 2019 Credit Agreement of $562.3 million, partially offset by repayment of our previous term loan of $520.3 million, a pre-payment penalty of $10.4 million incurred on our previous term loan, and deferred financing costs of $8.8 million incurred in securing our 2019 Credit Agreement. In addition, we paid $1.4 million in settlement of certain stock-based awards held by terminated employees.\nCash used in financing activities was $5.2 million during 2018, including $4.2 million for the repurchase of common stock and the settlement of stock-based payment awards and $1.0 million for the repayment of outstanding debt related to capital leases.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table sets forth the amounts of our significant contractual obligations and commitments with definitive payment terms as of December 31, 2020:\nPayments due by Period\nTotal Less than\n1 Year 1-3 years 3-5 Years More than\n5 years\n(in thousands)\nRevolving credit facility-commitment fees(1)\n$ 1,933 $ 400 $ 800 $ 733 $ -\nUnconditional purchase obligations(2)\n68,568 35,434 22,450 10,684 -\nOperating lease obligations(3)\n45,586 9,308 17,283 12,269 6,726\nTotal $ 116,087 $ 45,142 $ 40,533 $ 23,686 $ 6,726\n________________\n(1)We are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.20-0.35%, based on the Company's leverage ratio, on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility under the 2020 Credit Agreement. We have estimated the obligations based on the facts and circumstances in place at December 31, 2020.\n(2)We have unconditional purchase obligations that primarily consist of commitments related to our co-located data centers, telecommunication, networking, subscription and consulting services.\n(3)Our operating lease obligations consist primarily of office space and warehousing.\nImpact of Inflation\nWhile inflation may impact our net revenues and costs of revenues, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant. However, there can be no assurance that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.\nIndemnification Agreements\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms pursuant to which we agree to indemnify MSP partners, vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. No demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements and there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss or consolidated statement of cash flows. In addition, in connection with the completion of our IPO, we entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain officers and employees that require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020.\nJOBS Act\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding shareholder advisory \u201csay-on-pay\u201d votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation.\nThe JOBS Act also permits an emerging growth company like us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to \u201copt-in\u201d to this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards on a non-delayed basis.\nU.K.\u2019s Referendum Decision to Exit the European Union\nThe United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020 and the transition period during which most E.U. rules continued to apply expired on December 31, 2020. Although the U.K. and European Union have reached an agreement on certain terms concerning the U.K.'s withdrawal, there remains substantial uncertainty regarding the details of the U.K.'s ongoing relationship with the European Union. We continue to monitor the status of the negotiations and to plan for potential political, economic and social instability.\nSince we have historically provided our Business Management (PSA) and SaaS Protection products to European customers from a U.K. data center and have supported certain older BCDR devices through our U.K. data center, we have taken the following steps to mitigate the potential impact of Brexit on our operations:\n\u2022developed infrastructure that will allow us to provide both our PSA and SaaS Protection products out of our data center in Germany;\n\u2022permitted European customers to move their PSA, SaaS Protection and BCDR service instances from the U.K. to Germany;\n\u2022published a notice on our website regarding our Brexit preparations and the process to migrate accounts out of the U.K.;\n\u2022sent emails regarding Brexit to our potentially impacted customers; and\n\u2022began implementing a system where new customers will be able to track the region in which data is stored and opt for the desired location.\nThe ultimate impact of Brexit on our business operations and financial results is uncertain. For additional information on risks related to Brexit, see \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nOur critical accounting policies are those that materially affect our consolidated financial statements and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. A thorough understanding of these critical accounting policies is essential when reviewing our consolidated financial statements.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAccounting for stock-based compensation requires us to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions. If any of our estimates prove to be inaccurate, our net income (loss) and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (1) the fair value of common stock, (2) the expected stock price volatility, (3) the expected term of the award, (4) the risk-free interest rate and (5) expected dividends. Also, we made an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The assumptions for the Black-Scholes option-pricing model were estimated as follows:\n\u2022Fair value of common stock. Prior to our IPO our common stock was not yet publicly traded. As such we were required to estimate the fair value of our common stock, as discussed in \u201cCommon Stock Valuation\u201d below. For grants after the IPO, the fair value is based on the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE as reported on the last trading day prior to the grant date.\n\u2022Expected volatility. As a result of the lack of historical and implied volatility data of our common stock, the expected stock price volatility has been estimated based on the historical volatilities of a specified group of companies in our industry for a period equal to the expected life of the option. We selected companies with comparable characteristics to us, including enterprise value, risk profiles and position within the industry and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected term of the stock options. The historical volatility data has been computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies.\n\u2022Expected term. We determine the expected term based on the average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding using the simplified method, generally calculated as the midpoint of the stock options\u2019 vesting term and contractual expiration period, as we do not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior.\n\u2022Risk-free rate. Our risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the stock option\u2019s expected term.\n\u2022Expected dividend yield. We utilize a dividend yield of zero, as we do not currently issue dividends, nor do we expect to do so in the future.\nCommon Stock Valuation\nSince our IPO, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our equity awards has been based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last trading day prior to the grant date, as reported on the NYSE. Prior to our IPO, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying our equity awards was based on a determination by our Board, with input from management and contemporaneous third-party valuations, as there was no public market for our common stock.\nIn valuing our pre-IPO common stock, our Board determined the value using both the income and the market approach valuation methods. The income approach estimates value based on the expected future cash flows that our company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital, or WACC. To derive our WACC, a cost of equity was developed using the Capital Asset Pricing Model and comparable company betas, and a cost of debt was determined based on our estimated cost of borrowing. The costs of debt and equity were then weighted based on our actual capital structure. The market approach estimates value based on a comparison of our company to comparable publicly traded companies in a similar line of business and to acquisitions in the market. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined and subsequently applied to our historical and forecasted financial results to estimate our enterprise value. From the acquisitions analysis, a representative market multiple is determined and subsequently applied to our historical financial results to estimate our enterprise value.\nApplication of these approaches involves the use of estimates, judgment and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses, and cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies and the probability of possible future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the relationships among those assumptions could have a material impact on the valuation of our common stock as of each valuation date.\nRevenue Recognition and Contract Balances\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, which we adopted as of January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis. We generate revenue from fees received for subscriptions, support and related services, and from the sale of devices. We recognize revenue related to contracts with partners when we transfer promised goods or services to partners in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This is determined by following a five-step process which includes (1) identifying the contract with a partner, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price and (5) recognizing revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation.\nWe identify performance obligations in a contract based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the partner that are identifiable or distinct from other promises in the contract. If not considered distinct, the promised goods or services are combined with other goods or services and accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Determining the distinct performance obligations in a contract requires judgment. Our performance obligations primarily include subscription services, including warranties, unspecified upgrades or enhancements to our hosted SaaS offerings, delivery of devices and training. We believe that our technical support, warranties and unspecified upgrades or enhancements performance obligations each have the same pattern of transfer to the partner and are therefore accounted for as a single distinct performance obligation.\nWe allocate the transaction price of the contract to each distinct performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Estimating standalone selling prices for our performance obligations requires judgment and is based on multiple factors including, but not limited to, observable cost data, industry margin studies, historical selling prices, internal pricing policies and pricing practices in different regions and through different sales channels and internal cost structure. We review the standalone selling price for our performance obligations periodically and update them, if needed, to ensure that the methodology utilized reflects our current pricing practices.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record an accounts receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing and payment will become due solely based on the passage of time, a contract asset when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing and payment is contingent upon transfer of control of another separate performance obligation, or deferred revenue when payment is received prior to the recognition of revenue. We use judgement in determining the standalone selling price for our performance obligations which would affect the amount of contract balances recognized. Deferred revenue that will be realized during the succeeding 12-month period is recorded as current, and the remaining deferred revenue is recorded as non-current.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nWe capitalize commission expenses that are incremental to obtaining customer contracts, using a portfolio approach. These contract acquisition costs are deferred and recorded in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We make judgments in determining the\namount of costs to be expensed in the period, including amounts which are expensed as incurred, which is the approach if the expected period of benefit is less than one year, and amounts which are capitalized and expensed over future periods, which is the approach if the expected period of benefit is beyond one year. The period of benefit often extends beyond the contract term, as we only pay a commission on the initial contract term and not upon renewal of the contract. We have determined that the expected period of benefit is five years based on evaluation of a number of factors, including customer attrition rates, weighted average useful lives of our partner relationship and developed technology intangible assets, and market factors, including the overall competitive environment and the technology life utilized by competitors. Contract acquisition costs which are capitalized are amortized as a component of sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a description of our recently adopted accounting pronouncements and accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted, see Note 2.

It gives technology leaders a data-driven view of their development process to enable their teams to be more successful by debugging development processes and resolving bottlenecks.\nTogether, our products enable teams to develop, measure and deploy critical skills at scale and deliver products faster. We provide businesses with visibility into the strengths of their workforce, allowing them to better align resources, provide targeted skill development, and advance the skills of their teams. Ultimately, our mission is to democratize technology skills.\nWe continue to expand our product offerings both organically and inorganically through acquisitions. In October 2020, we acquired DevelopIntelligence, a provider of strategic skills consulting and virtual instructor-led training, or ILT, for IT, software development, and engineering teams. We believe the acquisition will enhance our professional services offerings to create tailored, hands-on upskilling solutions to further drive digital transformation efforts. In January 2021, we acquired Next Tech, a provider of cloud-based computing environments to enable the authoring and hosting of labs in software development, data science and machine learning. The Next.Tech acquisition enables us to offer a more comprehensive solution by combining video content from our authors with hands-on experience.\nClosing the global technology skills gap requires more than success in our commercial business. That is why we created Pluralsight One, our social impact initiative, committed to serving marginalized populations that our commercial business will not reach. Refer to our \u201cSocial Impact\u201d discussion in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn recent years, we reached significant scale in users and our customer base, which span over 180 countries across the globe. As of December 31, 2020, we had 17,599 business customers, including over 1,900,000 business users, compared to approximately 980,000 business users as of December 31, 2019.\nWe achieved significant growth in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, our revenue totaled $391.9 million, $316.9 million, and $232.0 million, respectively, which represents year-over-year growth of 24%, 37%, and 39%, respectively. Our revenue from business customers for the same periods was $343.8 million, $271.8 million, and $188.2 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 26%, 44%, and\n50%. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, was $164.1 million, $163.6 million, and $146.8 million, respectively, which reflects our substantial investments in the future growth of our business.\nRecent Developments\nOn December 11, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Pluralsight Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and subsidiary of the Company, or Pluralsight Holdings and, together with the Company the Pluralsight Parties, Lake Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, or Parent I, Lake Guarantor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or Parent II and together with Parent I, the Parent Entities, Lake Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent I, or Merger Sub I, and Lake Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent II, or Merger Sub II and together with Merger Sub I, the Merger Subs and, together with the Parent Entities, the Buyer Parties, providing for the merger of Merger Sub II with and into Pluralsight Holdings, or the Holdings Merger, with Pluralsight Holdings continuing as the surviving entity in the Holdings Merger. The Merger Agreement also provides for the merger of Merger Sub I with and into the Company, or the Company Merger and, together with the Holdings Merger, the Mergers, with Pluralsight continuing as the surviving corporation in the Company Merger. The Parent Entities and the Merger Subs are affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Fund VII, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, or Vista.\nIf the Mergers are completed, at the effective times of the Mergers: (i) each share of Class A common stock outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Company Merger (except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $20.26, without interest and (ii) each common unit of Pluralsight Holdings, or Holdings units outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Holdings Merger (except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $20.26 per share, without interest.\nIn addition, at the effective time of the Company Merger, each share of Class B common stock and each share of Class C common stock which correspond on a one-for-one basis with the Holdings units, outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Company Merger (except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement) will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $0.0001, without interest, as provided in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of Pluralsight.\nCertain of our stockholders presently publicly oppose the Mergers and may attempt to solicit our stockholders to vote against the Mergers. There are also legal proceedings pending regarding the Merger. For more information regarding these matters, please see Risk Factors-\u201cRisks Related to Entering into a Definitive Agreement to Be Acquired\u201d and Note 12 to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Platform\nOur platform provides businesses the solutions that they need to upskill teams into modern roles and improve workflow efficiency. The key components of our platform\u2019s products, Pluralsight Skills and Pluralsight Flow, include:\nPluralsight Skills\n\u2022Skill and Role Assessments: Our assessment tool uses machine learning and advanced algorithms to measure a user\u2019s skills, benchmark that user against others in the industry, and recommend opportunities for growth. Users are provided with a Skill IQ that quantifies if a user is a novice, proficient, or expert within technologies such as AngularJS, C#, and Java. Role IQ allows our users to quantify and develop a collection of skills that are required for success in technology roles. This provides greater clarity around the technology skills required for a specific job role and a clear path to concept mastery. For example, we have Role IQ\u2019s for common technology roles including: Security Analyst, React Web Developer, and Cloud Architect. Skills assessments can be mapped to a defined role in order to benchmark a user\u2019s technical proficiency against what is required to master that role.\nWe provide a modern skill assessment experience that gives businesses a credible, adaptable, and efficient model for validating technology skills.\n\u2022Course Library: Our course library includes a digital ecosystem of thousands of on-demand courses across a range of technology subject areas, including cloud, mobile, security, IT, and data, which was recently enhanced by our acquisition of DevelopIntelligence. Video courses, or videos, are organized by modules and clips and are searchable, so users can either take an entire course or target an area for a specific need. The majority of our courses are transcribed, and once transcribed, are available with closed captioning in over 100 languages. We built our exclusive course library primarily by engaging our world-class community of subject-matter experts, or authors, who create content for us and share in our success by receiving revenue-share amounts based on the viewing of their content. In addition, our platform offers several opportunities for hands-on practice, including Labs, interactive courses, and projects. Labs provide a provisioned environment with step-by-step guidance to gain real world experience in solutions like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. Interactive courses offer an in-browser developer environment that allows users to practice as they learn through coding challenges with real-time feedback. Our projects feature extends the practice modules to the user\u2019s local coding environment, allowing users to apply knowledge to real-world, on-the-job scenarios.\n\u2022Paths: Based on either an assessment or a user\u2019s goals, our directed learning paths are personalized to take users through a set of courses designed to help them master a particular subject area and not spend time reviewing content that they already know. Businesses can customize learning paths to meet company-specific objectives and roles.\n\u2022Business Analytics: Our business analytics tools enable business customers to index the technology skills of their teams, align learning to key business objectives, determine the usage of our platform, examine trends in skill development, and quantify the impact of our platform on their business.\n\u2022Priorities: Our priorities tool offers technology leaders curated channels and channel groups comprised of content and assessments that align to a specific priority. With priorities, technology leaders have the option to identify and designate a technology priority, select the applicable channels and channel groups containing content and assessments that support that priority, then measure over time engagement and skill development toward that priority.\nPluralsight Flow\n\u2022Pluralsight Flow aggregates historical source control and ticketing data to provide insights and productivity metrics to software developers and their leaders. The metrics within Pluralsight Flow visualize code commits and code reviews to help leaders and teams observe dynamics and patterns in the code development process. Code commit metrics show leaders the time software developers spend on reworking legacy code by providing concrete data around commit risk and code churn. Code review metrics evaluate productivity and help leaders observe team dynamics and patterns in the code review process. Team collaboration metrics help leaders manage knowledge distribution and teamwork dynamics that may be impacting cycle times and software code quality. The delivery module component of Pluralsight Flow provides insights into the overall software cycle identifying hotspots and blockers, highlighting trends and patterns, and providing transparency to teams on the movement of tickets through the workflow.\nKey Benefits of Our Platform\nWe developed our platform to empower businesses to enable smarter, more efficient workers and to drive innovation in this period of digital transformation. Key benefits of our platform include the following:\nHigh quality, curated content\nWe believe we have the most relevant course library for the greatest number of technology professionals. Our content is the product of our industry-leading authors. We spent many years identifying, cultivating, and growing\nour author network, and over 1,500 authors have contributed to our current course library. One of the primary challenges for businesses and individuals seeking to enhance technology skills is finding the right resources. We address that challenge for them. Our extensive relationships within the developer and technical communities allow us to source and retain the best subject-matter experts to produce relevant content for our users. We provide quality assurance on our authors\u2019 expertise through our selection process and by having our in-house technology professionals and practitioners, as well as other authors, perform reviews on the quality and effectiveness of all content before it is published to our platform. This content curation ensures our users are receiving high-quality, consistent results from our platform.\nWe conduct a thorough, strategic analysis of current job postings and leverage the knowledge of our on-staff subject matter experts and author community to determine the most in-demand tech roles, skills and technologies. The benefit of working with job posting data and continuous, qualitative input from our on-staff curriculum team is that we readily identify shifts in the market and pivot our content strategy accordingly. These factors help us identify which roles, skills and technologies are most needed, and how often they appear in the workplace, which enables us to prioritize content creation and determine the depth and breadth of content supporting these in-demand skills.\nAlign skill development to learning styles and business needs\nWe view skill development as a holistic process. Our integrated platform combines skill and role assessments, a curated library of expert-authored courses, directed learning paths, business analytics, Labs, interactive courses, and projects to ensure that learners are taking the courses most useful to them and demonstrating comprehension of the subject matter. Through our skill assessment engine, powered by Iris, we are able to assess the proficiency of a user in a role or a topic through adaptive tests and provide a Skill IQ or Role IQ. By gathering such insights from our platform, businesses can understand skills gaps, benchmark employees against consistent standards, and address skill development needs in an efficient and targeted manner.\nObtain visibility into team skills and efficiencies\nOur two-product platform provides teams with a 360-degree approach to increasing efficiency and accelerating product development. With Pluralsight Skills and Pluralsight Flow together, teams can benchmark technical proficiency against their priorities, upskill into the roles they need and monitor their workflow patterns to deliver innovations on time and under budget. Our platform supports the technologist in his or her entire journey from skill gap discovery to skill development to skill application and back again as technology continues to evolve.\nCost effective technology skills platform\nWe believe our pricing model provides a significant cost advantage compared to traditional technology skill development offerings. As our customers\u2019 industries and business models evolve, they require a learning solution that helps them deliver key innovations with demanding time and budgetary constraints. Our business subscriptions published pricing ranges from $579 to $779 per user per year for Pluralsight Skills, providing what we believe to be a significant cost advantage over alternative solutions. In addition, our platform can be deployed with little to no implementation services required.\nOur Pluralsight Flow solution is priced similarly to Pluralsight Skills at $499 to $699 per year per active contributor to a customer\u2019s code base. We believe the insights provided by Pluralsight Flow promote work efficiencies, which drive cost savings to our customers.\nOptimized for on-demand accessibility\nWe offer our content the way users want to consume it. Our cloud-based technology skills platform is an on-demand solution that allows globally distributed users to access courses anytime they want from almost any device, maximizing utilization of our product and workplace efficiency. Our mobile applications are available on iOS and Android operating systems, and our desktop application is available on Mac and PCs. Courses can be temporarily downloaded and viewed offline. Our platform allows users to participate and take notes while watching our courses. These applications allow our users to take our courses when convenient for them.\nOur platform is designed for the professional technologist but it can be used by anyone, at any skill level, who has an interest in improving their technology skills. We offer a range of courses from novice to expert skill levels, with significant granularity within each topic so users can access the content most relevant to their specific needs. We utilize a cloud-based delivery model that enables us to regularly make new content available to users and allows businesses to deliver consistent skill development across distributed workforces. Users can access our platform to learn anytime and anywhere. Pluralsight applications are delivered on demand and across a range of devices and operating systems, including iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac. In addition, Pluralsight applications are available for TV applications, including Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, and Chromecast.\nGrowth Strategy\nWe are pursuing the following principal strategies to drive our growth:\nExpand deployments within our customer base\nWe utilize a land-and-expand strategy within businesses, beginning with either individual users or departmental deployments. Our Skills platform is used by individuals, software developer groups, IT departments, line of business users, and human resources. Historically we have expanded from small teams to departments to business-wide deployments of our platform. We intend to drive increased sales to existing customers by targeting new users, departments, and geographies with current and new offerings and capabilities. In addition, as we expand our product offerings, such as the addition of Pluralsight Flow, we intend to drive increased sales to our existing customers through cross-sell efforts. As an example of our expansion potential within our customer base, our 25 largest customers as of December 31, 2020 expanded their annual spend by approximately 40 times the amount they spent in the year of their initial purchase.\nGrow our business customer base\nWe have a large direct sales force to focus on business sales and have aligned our sales team\u2019s compensation structure to fit this objective. We intend to pursue a greater proportion of large scale, recurring business transactions and to more effectively drive business customer engagement throughout the life of the relationship. As an example of our ability to increase customer engagement, as of December 31, 2020, the number of customers with annual subscription revenue greater than $1,000,000 had grown by 59% when compared to December 31, 2019. We will continue to expand our platform capabilities to deliver additional value to our business customers. Our sales force educates business customers on the strengths of our platform to help customers make informed decisions and create a customized and unified end-to-end learning experience for their businesses.\nGeographic Expansion\nWe see a significant opportunity to expand our reach internationally. We have customers in over 180 countries around the world and continue to develop our sales teams in Europe and in the Asia Pacific region to further address these large markets impacted by rapidly changing technologies.\nStrategic Acquisitions\nStrategic acquisitions have enabled us to scale our business, expand our course library, add features to our platform, and address new areas of technology in high demand by our customers. Over the past eight years, we made eleven targeted strategic acquisitions, which allowed us to expand our course library, author base, platform capabilities and product offerings. For example, the acquisition of DevelopIntelligence in October 2020 furthers our mission of being the most effective path to technology skill development. The addition of ILT and virtual ILT offerings allows us to fill even more upskilling and reskilling needs of our enterprise customers through custom, hands-on instructor-led training, pairing well with our Skills platform. In January 2021, we acquired Next Tech, a provider of cloud-based computing environments to enable the authoring and hosting of labs in software development, data science and machine learning. The Next Tech acquisition enables us to offer a more comprehensive solution by combining video content from our authors with hands-on experience.\nWe have proven success with identifying core capabilities in the market, acquiring talent and technology, and integrating these assets into our platform for a unified user experience. We may continue selectively adding content and platform capabilities through acquisitions that enhance value to our customers.\nExpand course library and offer additional platform features\nWe plan to continue expanding our course library to address the most relevant topics for users. We anticipate continued strong growth in our technology skills platform as we build out content in new areas like cloud, data science, data engineering, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and security.\nWe introduced and acquired several platform features that have been integrated into our cloud-based technology skills platform, including improved reporting and visualization features for company leadership. We will continue adding more features to our platform over time which we believe will strengthen our position as the go-to platform for technology leaders to deliver on their innovation strategies.\nTechnology and Content\nOur cloud-hosted, multi-tenant application platform is designed for enterprise scalability to enable significant growth in our user base, support businesses with widely distributed locations, and provide high levels of system performance and availability. Our distributed and scalable technology architecture allows our global user base to access courses anytime they want from almost any device, maximizing utilization of our platform.\nIris\nPluralsight Skills is powered by Iris, our machine learning intelligence underlying our skill assessments algorithm, user gap analysis and personalized content recommendations that guide users on how to develop desired skills. With every assessment and course completed, Iris absorbs information about the state of technology skills across our overall user base, within a specific business customer\u2019s users, and for each individual user, thereby allowing our platform to provide predictive, personalized skill development solutions and adapt to the needs of our customers. Iris creates a smarter, more personalized learning journey for our users.\nContent Creation\nOur course library was created primarily by our world-class community of authors and industry partners. By publishing courses on our platform, we provide authors with exposure to our broad user base, thereby enabling our authors to build their reputations and increase their name recognition as a trusted source in the market. In addition, we share our success with our authors, who receive revenue-share amounts based on the viewing of their content. This incentivizes authors to create new, up-to-date, high-quality content, which drives customer growth and user adoption, creating a virtuous cycle that promotes our continued growth.\nWe identify and select prospective authors based on their skills, experience, following in user communities, popularity, ability to effectively instruct, and commitment to advancing knowledge about their discipline.\nWe provide authors with a set of tools and skill development materials to instruct them on our course design methodology. They are assigned to one of our content leaders, or production editors, to help them select topics, create a framework for their courses, and support them through the course production and editing process. External peer reviewers, who are generally authors, help ensure technical accuracy. Authors produce courses and presentations from their own location on their own time, making the process scalable and efficient.\nBased on the size of our author community and the related depth and breadth of technical knowledge, we have the ability to consistently deliver current and relevant content to keep pace with technology\u2019s fast pace of change. For example, in 2020, our authors published courses on average within 69 days of being engaged to create the course.\nPluralsight Flow\nOur proprietary software utilizes code commits, pull requests and ticket data to process, analyze and visualize software developer coding activities into actionable metrics. We have created a number of metrics designed to measure the volume, type, and complexity of each code commit. Our solution is designed to work with a variety of commonly-used software coding and IT ticketing environments.\nTechnology and Content Team\nIn conjunction with machine learning and data science, our technology and content teams use a human-centered design and development approach to engage with customers, users, and industry analysts through interviews and surveys on a frequent basis to understand customer needs and general industry trends to enhance our platform and course library. This allows us to build a platform that is uniquely positioned to deliver a highly personalized journey that focuses on the user and provides deep business analytics. The primary function of our technology team is to evaluate new technologies, determine the best technologies to create for our platform, incorporate new features and functionality into our platform to improve user experience, and ensure our solutions are delivered seamlessly, as well as to ensure that our platform is resilient and available to our customers at any time. Our content team tracks subject-matter experts across a variety of categories, researches the latest technology trends and adoption within businesses, and works with our authors to create high-quality content which addresses the needs of our customers.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had over 485 employees in our technology and content organization. We intend to continue investing in our technology and content organization to strengthen our existing platform and add new capabilities to enhance our value to customers.\nSeasonality\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate due to various factors affecting our performance. We have historically experienced seasonality in terms of when we enter into agreements with customers. We typically enter into a higher percentage of agreements with new customers, as well as renewal agreements with existing customers, in the fourth quarter of each year and usually during the last month within each quarter. The increase in customer agreements entered into in the fourth quarter is generally attributable to large enterprise buying patterns typical in the software industry. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recognized 27% of our revenue, and recorded 35% of our total billings. As the terms of most of our customer agreements are measured in full year increments, agreements initially entered into in the fourth quarter will generally come up for renewal at that same time in subsequent years. This seasonality is reflected in our billings, and to a lesser extent, our revenue. We generally recognize revenue from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract. Therefore, changes in our contracting activity in the near term may not impact changes to our reported revenue until future periods.\nCustomers\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 17,599 business customers on our platform. We experienced rapid growth within large businesses. Our client base is diversified across industries, such as financial services, internet, technology, healthcare, media and entertainment, consumer goods and retail, transportation and logistics, government contractors, manufacturing, energy, education, and professional services.\nSales and Marketing\nOur Skills platform is designed to be easy to access and use, which allows both individual and business customers to seamlessly purchase subscriptions to, and deploy, our platform. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 21% of our revenue was derived from self-service subscriptions to our platform without any direct interaction with our sales team. Our self-service deployments are typically to small business teams and individual customers, which represent the \u201ctop of the funnel\u201d for larger deployments, bringing our technology into the workplace and proliferating usage within a business.\nWe also deploy a direct sales team focused on landing new business customers, renewing existing subscriptions, and expanding business-wide deployments, as well as a field sales team responsible for sourcing new prospects and upsell opportunities. We expect to increase penetration of our business customers by expanding their use of our platform to address additional use cases and increasing the number of their employees who utilize our platform.\nOur marketing efforts are focused on generating awareness of our cloud-based technology skills platform, creating sales leads, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of loyal customers and authors. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including search engine and email marketing, online banner and video advertising, blogs, corporate communications, white papers, case studies, user events including Pluralsight LIVE, and webinars.\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,700 full-time employees, of which over 1,400 are based in the United States. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are good.\nWe are committed to attracting top talent, providing career development opportunities for employees, retaining employees through competitive total rewards programs, creating diversity within our global workforce, and instilling a sense of belonging among employees.\n\u2022Employee Engagement: Through quarterly surveys, company-wide town halls, department-level meetings, and exit interviews, we provide all employees with the opportunity to share their opinions and feedback on our strategy, culture, and employee experience. We measure and analyze the results of engagement surveys, in particular, to enhance the employee experience, promote retention, and drive change within our people programs.\n\u2022Talent Training and Development: We offer numerous talent training and development programs to team members, including tuition and professional development reimbursement programs. We developed career ladders for the majority of our roles, empowering our team members to monitor and manage the trajectory and progression of their role and field. We instituted performance agreements for every team member, which are directly tied to departmental and company objectives and key results. Additionally, we provide skills training through our platform and leadership training to managers. Lastly, Pluralsight leaders provide countless hours of one-on-one and group coaching to help them achieve their goals.\n\u2022Diversity and Belonging: We are committed to improving our demographics and creating a more diverse workplace because it aligns with our mission and creates a strong experience for team members. An example of this is showcased in the development of our internship program with Howard University, a historically black college/university. We are increasing our focus on education around cultural competency and implicit bias, and running audits of programs and processes, knowing that if systemic inequities exist in our programs, they will disproportionately affect team members of historically marginalized communities. We want all team members to feel safe and celebrated for who they are, and have three Employee Resource Groups focused on building inclusive communities: Women@Pluralsight, seeColor (BIPOC), and PRIDE. Breaking barriers and creating equal access to opportunity is inherent in our mission to democratize technology skills.\n\u2022Talent Recruitment and Hiring Processes: As we focus more deeply on diversity and belonging, we have also brought this focus into our talent acquisition programs and processes. We partnered with Howard University in 2020 to onboard interns. We also worked with YearUp, a Boston organization that brings top companies and talented young adults together to power business, launch careers, and build community. Our implicit bias and interview training for hiring managers is aimed at helping them understand where they might be unconsciously bringing biases to the hiring process. We also broadened our set of sources to identify and locate talent with the intention of increasing diversity at the top of the recruiting funnel.\n\u2022Safety: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Pluralsight has shifted its global workforce fully remote. We did this to prioritize the health and safety of our team members\u2019 families and communities. We have developed a COVID-19 policy and plan for our office locations once we are able to reopen.\n\u2022Health and Wellness: As part of our total rewards package, team members are permitted to seek reimbursement for health and wellness expenses. To help team members navigate some of the unique challenges of 2020, we offered recorded meditation and yoga videos, mental health seminars, among others.\n\u2022Compensation and Benefits: We offer team members competitive base salaries and a bonus or commission plan depending on the role. We also provide employee equity programs; cover 100% of the premiums for health, medical and dental insurance; and offer unlimited PTO and generous parental and medical leave programs. Team members can participate in a 401(k) (or similar pension programs depending on the country) with employer matching; obtain tuition assistance; and utilize our remote work policy.\nAmong our achievements in 2020 are being recognized by Great Place to Work\u00ae and FORTUNE as one of the 100 Best Companies to Work For, a Best Workplace for Technology, and a Best Workplace for Millennials.\nBelow are graphical depictions of the demographics of our employee population as of September 2020.

We expect competition to continue to accelerate and intensify in the future as competitors bundle new and more competitive offerings with their existing products and services, and as products and product enhancements are introduced into our market. There are relatively modest barriers to entry in our industry, as well as low switching costs relative to the broader enterprise software sector. In addition, the emergence of new, highly capitalized competition and free or ad-supported offerings (e.g., leveraging YouTube, GitHub and similar platforms) has accelerated and intensified competitive pressures.\nWe compete directly or indirectly with:\n\u2022ILT vendors, such as Global Knowledge, General Assembly, and New Horizons;\n\u2022legacy e-learning services, such as Skillsoft and O\u2019Reilly;\n\u2022certification and training courses, such as A Cloud Guru and CBT Nuggets;\n\u2022individual-focused e-learning services, such as LinkedIn Learning, Udemy, and Udacity;\n\u2022engineering analytics tools, such as Code Climate, Waydev, and BlueOptima; and\n\u2022free solutions, such as YouTube.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:\n\u2022breadth, depth, and quality of content library;\n\u2022platform features and functionality;\n\u2022reliability and scalability;\n\u2022performance;\n\u2022user experience;\n\u2022brand;\n\u2022security and privacy;\n\u2022price;\n\u2022accessibility across several devices, operating systems, and applications;\n\u2022third-party and customer integration;\n\u2022effectiveness and quality of support and professional services;\n\u2022customer, technology, and platform support; and\n\u2022continued innovation.\nWe believe we compete favorably across these factors and are largely uninhibited by legacy constraints. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases, and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings. Moreover, because our market is changing rapidly, it is possible that new entrants, especially those with substantial resources, more efficient operating models, more rapid technology and content development cycles, or lower marketing costs, could introduce new products and services that disrupt our market and better address the needs of our customers and\npotential customers. Competitive pressures have in the past and may in the future result in lower retention, higher sales and marketing spending and slower growth.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We believe our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had three pending patent applications and two published patent applications in the United States and abroad. These patent applications seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business.\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate. We also have common law rights in some unregistered trademarks that were established over years of use.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it beneficial. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States.\nOur Organizational Structure\nIn May 2018, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO. Our IPO was conducted through what is commonly referred to as an \u201cUP-C\u201d structure. In connection with the IPO and the UP-C structure, we completed the following transactions, referred to as the Reorganization Transactions:\n\u2022The Fourth LLC Agreement of Pluralsight Holdings was amended and restated to, among other things: (i) appoint Pluralsight, Inc. as its sole managing member and (ii) effectuate the conversion of all outstanding redeemable convertible preferred limited liability company units, incentive units, and Class B incentive units into a single class of LLC Units.\n\u2022Certain members of Pluralsight Holdings that were corporations merged with and into Pluralsight, Inc. and certain members of Pluralsight Holdings contributed certain of their LLC Units to Pluralsight, Inc., in each case in exchange for shares of Class A common stock.\n\u2022The certificate of incorporation of Pluralsight, Inc. was amended and restated to authorize three classes of common stock, Class A common stock, Class B common stock, Class C common stock, and one class of preferred stock. Class B and Class C common stock were issued on a one-for-one basis to the members of Pluralsight Holdings who retained LLC Units, or the Continuing Members. Class B and Class C common stock have voting rights but no economic rights.\nAs the sole managing member of Pluralsight Holdings, Pluralsight, Inc. has the sole voting interest in Pluralsight Holdings and controls all of the business operations, affairs, and management of Pluralsight Holdings. Accordingly, Pluralsight, Inc. consolidates the financial results of Pluralsight Holdings and reports the non-controlling interests of the Continuing Members\u2019 LLC Units on its consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the Reorganization Transactions completed as part of the IPO.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in December 2017. Our principal executive offices are located at 42 Future Way, Draper, Utah 84020, and our telephone number is (801) 784-9007. Our Class A common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cPS.\u201d Our corporate website address is http://www.pluralsight.com.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the sections entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis section of the Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons of 2019 to 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2019 and are hereby incorporated by reference herein and considered part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K only to the extent referenced.\nOverview\nWe are a leading technology workforce development platform committed to closing the global technology skills gap. Learners on our platform can quickly acquire today\u2019s most valuable technology skills through on-demand, high-quality learning experiences delivered by subject-matter experts. Skills can be measured and assessed in real-time providing technology leaders with visibility into the capabilities of their teams and confidence their teams will deliver on critical objectives. Our platform empowers teams to keep up with the pace of technological change, puts the right people on the right projects and boosts productivity.\nWe started operations in 2004 and focused initially on in-person instructor-led training. Anticipating the increasing demand for online solutions, we began offering online courses in 2008 and shifted entirely to an online delivery model in 2011. Since 2011, we extended our offering to include new content areas and additional features which expanded our addressable market, attracted new users, and deepened our foothold within businesses.\nWe expanded our platform both organically through internal initiatives and through acquisitions, which have been focused on adding content and capabilities to our offerings. In 2019, we completed the acquisition of GitPrime, and we believe the addition of GitPrime, now Pluralsight Flow, enhances our platform by measuring software developer productivity. Pluralsight Flow aggregates data from code commits, pull requests and tickets, and packages this data into actionable metrics. Pluralsight Flow enables technology leaders to enhance skills and drive productivity by identifying talent and areas of improvement within their teams.\nOur additions and improvements to our platform have enabled us to strengthen our relationships with our business customers and increase our revenue over time. We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. We sell subscriptions to our platform primarily to business customers through our direct sales team and our website. We also sell subscriptions to our skills development platform to individual customers directly through our website. In addition, small teams often represent the \u201ctop of the funnel\u201d for larger deployments, bringing our technology into their workplaces and proliferating usage of our platform within their companies.\nWe are focused on attracting businesses, particularly large enterprises, to our platform and expanding their use of our platform over time. We believe there exists a significant opportunity to drive sales to large enterprises, including expanding relationships with existing customers and attracting new customers. Our ability to attract large enterprises to our platform and to expand their use of our platform will be important for the success of our business and our results of operations.\nIn October 2020, we acquired DevelopIntelligence, a provider of strategic skills consulting and virtual instructor-led training for IT, software development, and engineering teams. We believe the acquisition will enable us to create tailored, hands-on upskilling solutions to further drive digital transformation efforts.\nWe achieved significant growth in recent periods. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, our revenue totaled $391.9 million, $316.9 million, and $232.0 million, respectively, which represents year-over-year growth of 24%, 37%, and 39%, respectively. Our revenue from business customers for the same periods was $343.8 million, $271.8 million, and $188.2 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 26%, 44%, and 50%. Our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, was $164.1 million, $163.6 million, and $146.8 million, respectively, which reflects our substantial investments in the future growth of our business.\nIn December 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Pluralsight Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and subsidiary of the Company, or Pluralsight Holdings and, together with the Company the Pluralsight Parties, Lake Holdings, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, or Parent I, Lake Guarantor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or Parent II and together with Parent I, the Parent Entities, Lake Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent I, or Merger Sub I, and Lake Merger Sub II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent II, or Merger Sub II and together with Merger Sub I, the Merger Subs and, together with the Parent Entities, the Buyer Parties, providing for the merger of Merger Sub II with and into Pluralsight Holdings, or the Holdings Merger, with Pluralsight Holdings continuing as the surviving entity in the Holdings Merger. The Merger Agreement also provides for the merger of Merger Sub I with and into the Company, or the Company Merger and, together with the Holdings Merger, the Mergers, with Pluralsight continuing as the surviving corporation in the Company Merger. The Parent Entities and the Merger Subs are affiliates of Vista Equity Partners Fund VII, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, or Vista.\nFor more information regarding legal proceedings regarding the Mergers, please see Note 12 to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCOVID-19 Update\nOn March 11, 2020 COVID-19 was characterized by the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) as a global pandemic. The unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a widespread impact on economies, governments, communities, and business practices. In efforts to mitigate the harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and curtail the spread of the virus, federal, state and local authorities have implemented and may continue implementing safety measures, including the closure of businesses deemed \u201cnon-essential;\u201d social distancing; international border closures; and travel restrictions. Since March 2020, responsive measures we have undertaken include shifting customer events to virtual-only experiences; temporarily closing our offices and implementing a mandatory work-from-home policy for our worldwide workforce; restricting employee travel, encouraged vendors to reduce their fees and costs, limited the hiring of additional personnel and pushed market and merit raises until 2021. We actively monitor the situation closely and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve with a focus on the best interests of our employees, customers, vendors and stockholders. The ongoing effects of these operational modifications on our financial performance, including revenue, billings and results of operations are unknown and may not be realized until future reporting periods.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business and financial operations. The duration and magnitude of the COVID-19-driven global recession and the extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our business operations and overall financial performance remains unknown at this time. Certain developments, some of which are uncertain and not within our control, including the span and spread of the outbreak; the severity and transmission rate of the virus and emergence of new strains; the measures implemented or suggested by governing bodies to slow the spread of the virus; the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, including vaccines and their distribution; travel restrictions; international border closures; the effect on our vendors, customers, and community; the global economy and political conditions; the health of our employees, contractors, and their families; the duration of the recession; how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activities can resume; and other factors that are not predictable. After the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue experiencing adverse effects to our business, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic-driven recession.\nThe economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has financially constrained and may continue to financially constrain some of our prospective and existing customers\u2019 technology related spending, which has affected our revenue and billings growth rates, causing a decline in our dollar-based net retention rate in 2020. Additionally,\nsome customers\u2019 ability to pay in accordance with our agreed upon payment terms has been compromised by the financial hardships presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted and continues to result in extended pay periods. As a result, we have made and will continue to make adjustments to our expenses and cash flow to correlate with potential declines in billings and cash collections from customers. These adjustments include the restriction of employee travel and other non-essential operating costs, and temporary reductions in hiring. Our platform is provided under a subscription-based model, and as a result, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition may not be fully realized until future periods.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe monitor business customers, billings, dollar-based net retention rate, and certain related key business metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(dollars in thousands)\nBusiness customers (end of period) 17,599 17,942 16,756\nBillings $ 430,422 $ 379,051 $ 293,583\nBillings from business customers\n$ 380,788 $ 330,143 $ 248,159\n% of billings from business customers\n88 % 87 % 85 %\nDollar-based net retention rate 109 % 123 % 128 %\nBusiness Customers\nWe use the number of business customers to measure and monitor the growth of our business and the success of our sales and marketing activities and believe that the growth of our business customer base is indicative of our long-term billings and revenue growth potential. We define a business customer as a unique account in our customer relationship management system that had an active paying subscription at the end of the period presented. Each unique account in our customer relationship management system is considered a unique business customer as the system does not create unique accounts for individual customers, and, in some cases, there may be more than one business customer within a single organization.\nBillings\nWe use billings to measure and monitor our ability to provide our business with the working capital generated by upfront payments from our customers and our ability to sell subscriptions to our platform to both new and existing customers. Billings represent our total revenue plus the change in deferred revenue in the period, as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows, less the change in contract assets and unbilled accounts receivable in the period. Billings in any particular period represent amounts invoiced to our customers and reflect subscription renewals and upsells to existing customers plus sales to new customers. Our pricing and subscription periods vary for business customers and individual customers. Subscription periods for our business customers generally range from one to three years, with a majority being one year. We typically invoice our business customers in advance in annual installments. Subscription periods for our individual customers range from one month to one year and we typically invoice them in advance in monthly or annual installments.\nWe use billings from business customers and our percentage of billings from business customers to measure and monitor our ability to sell subscriptions to our platform to business customers. We believe that billings from business customers will be a significant source of future revenue growth and a key factor affecting our long-term performance. We expect our billings from business customers to continue to increase as a percentage of billings over the long term.\nDuring 2020, our billings growth rate declined compared to prior results due in part to the global economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As we generally recognize revenue from subscription fees ratably over the term of the contract, due to the difference in timing of billings received and when we recognize revenue, changes to our billings and billings growth rates are not immediately reflected in our revenue and revenue growth rates. As a result, we expect that the decline in our billings growth rate during 2020 will reduce the growth rate of our revenue in future periods.\nDollar-Based Net Retention Rate\nOur ability to upsell our platform across our business customers, particularly our enterprise customers, and expand such customers\u2019 usage of our platform across their organizations, is further highlighted by our strong dollar-based net retention rate. We use our dollar-based net retention rate to measure our ability to retain and expand the revenue generated from our existing business customers. Our dollar-based net retention rate compares our subscription revenue from the same set of customers across comparable periods. We calculate our dollar-based net retention rate on a trailing four-quarter basis. To calculate our dollar-based net retention rate, we first calculate the subscription revenue in one quarter from a cohort of customers that were customers at the beginning of the same quarter in the prior fiscal year, or cohort customers. We repeat this calculation for each quarter in the trailing four-quarter period. The numerator for dollar-based net retention rate is the sum of subscription revenue from cohort customers for the four most recent quarters, or numerator period, and the denominator is the sum of subscription revenue from cohort customers for the four quarters preceding the numerator period. Dollar-based net retention rate is the quotient obtained by dividing the numerator by the denominator.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. Amounts that have been invoiced are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are generally recognized ratably as revenue over the subscription period. Subscription terms typically range from one year to three years for business customers and from one month to one year for individual customers, and such terms begin on the date access to our platform is made available to the customer. Most of our subscriptions to business customers are billed in annual installments even if customers are contractually committed by multi-year agreements. Subscriptions that allow the customer to take software on-premise without significant penalty are recognized at a point in time when the software is made available to the customer. We also derive revenue from providing professional services, which generally consist of consulting, integration, or other services, such as instructor-led training and content creation.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nCost of revenue includes certain direct costs associated with delivering our platform and includes costs for author and instructor fees, amortization of our content library and other acquired intangibles, hosting and delivery fees, merchant processing fees, depreciation of capitalized software development costs for internal-use software, employee-related costs, including equity-based compensation expense associated with our customer support and professional services organizations, and third-party transcription costs.\nGross profit, or revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the mix of subscriptions we sell, the cost of author fees, the costs associated with third-party hosting services, and the extent to which we expand our customer support and professional services organizations. We expect our gross margin to increase over the long term primarily due to a decrease in author fees as a percentage of revenue, although our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of the factors described above.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are classified as sales and marketing, technology and content, and general and administrative. For each of these categories, the largest component is employee-related costs, which include salaries and bonuses, equity-based compensation expense, and employee benefit costs. We allocate shared overhead costs such as information technology infrastructure and facility-related costs based on headcount in each category.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee compensation costs of our sales and marketing employees, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, commissions, equity-based compensation expense, and allocated overhead costs. Other sales and marketing costs include user events, search engine and email marketing, content syndication, lead generation, and online banner and video advertising. The increases in sales and marketing expenses were driven primarily by increased employee compensation costs as we added headcount to support our growth as well as increased marketing and event related costs, including for Pluralsight LIVE, our user conference. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future and, in the near term, may increase as a percentage of our revenue as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel, increase our marketing activities, and grow our domestic and international operations. Additionally, our sales and marketing expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period depending on the timing of expenditures. However, we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term.\nTechnology and Content\nTechnology costs consist principally of research and development activities including personnel costs, consulting services, other costs associated with platform development efforts, and allocated overhead costs. Content costs consist principally of personnel costs and other activities associated with content development, course production, curriculum direction, and allocated overhead costs. Technology and content costs are expensed as incurred, except for certain costs relating to the development of internal-use software, including software used to upgrade and enhance our platform and applications supporting our business, which are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of one to three years. The increases in technology and content expenses were driven primarily by increased employee compensation costs as we added headcount to support our growth. We expect that our technology and content expenses will increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future and, in the near term, may increase as a percentage of our revenue as we continue to increase the functionality of and enhance our platform and develop new content and features. Additionally, our technology and content expense may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period depending on the timing of expenditures. However, we expect technology and content expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs and related expenses for executive, finance, legal, people operations, and administrative personnel, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and equity-based compensation expense; professional fees for external legal, accounting, recruiting, and other consulting services; and allocated overhead costs. The increases in general and administrative expenses were driven primarily by increased employee compensation costs as we added headcount to support our growth. We have incurred additional general and administrative expenses as a result of our organizational structure, including additional tax, accounting, and legal expenses, and operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC and listing standards of the applicable stock exchange, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities, and increased legal, audit, and consulting fees. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future and, in the near term, may increase as a percentage of our revenue. Additionally, our general and administrative expenses may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period depending on the timing of expenditures. However, we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over the long term.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense on the Notes and other long-term debt, losses related to the extinguishment of our long-term debt, interest income on cash, cash equivalents, and investments, and gains or losses on foreign currency transactions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nRevenue $ 391,865 $ 316,910 $ 232,029\nCost of revenue(1)(2)\n82,552 71,353 62,615\nGross profit 309,313 245,557 169,414\nOperating expenses(1)(2):\nSales and marketing 238,165 207,085 158,409\nTechnology and content 118,785 102,902 69,289\nGeneral and administrative 95,651 85,560 78,418\nTotal operating expenses 452,601 395,547 306,116\nLoss from operations (143,288) (149,990) (136,702)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense (29,322) (23,565) (6,826)\nLoss on debt extinguishment - (950) (4,085)\nOther income, net 8,411 11,749 1,504\nLoss before income taxes (164,199) (162,756) (146,109)\nIncome tax benefit (expense) 108 (823) (664)\nNet loss $ (164,091) $ (163,579) $ (146,773)\n________________________\n(1)Includes equity-based compensation expense as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue $ 1,213 $ 548 $ 205\nSales and marketing 41,168 30,677 19,096\nTechnology and content 26,222 21,430 12,038\nGeneral and administrative 31,250 37,782 41,153\nTotal equity-based compensation $ 99,853 $ 90,437 $ 72,492\n________________________\n(2)Includes amortization of acquired intangible assets as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nCost of revenue $ 5,458 $ 3,645 $ 7,586\nSales and marketing 296 129 389\nTechnology and content 580 705 706\nTotal amortization of acquired intangible assets $ 6,334 $ 4,479 $ 8,681\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nRevenue 100 % 100 % 100 %\nCost of revenue 21 23 27\nGross profit 79 77 73\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 61 65 68\nTechnology and content 30 32 30\nGeneral and administrative 24 27 34\nTotal operating expenses 115 124 132\nLoss from operations (36) (47) (59)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense (7) (7) (3)\nLoss on debt extinguishment - - (2)\nOther income, net 2 4 1\nLoss before income taxes (41) (50) (63)\nIncome tax benefit (expense) - - -\nNet loss (41) % (50) % (63) %\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenue\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2020 2019 Amount %\n(dollars in thousands)\nRevenue $ 391,865 $ 316,910 $ 74,955 24 %\nRevenue was $391.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $316.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $75.0 million, or 24%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to a $72.0 million, or 26%, increase in revenue from business customers, driven by sales to new business customers, as well as increased sales to our existing business customers as evidenced by our dollar-based net retention rate of 109% for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, there was an increase of $3.0 million in revenue from individual customers.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2020 2019 Amount %\n(dollars in thousands)\nCost of revenue $ 82,552 $ 71,353 $ 11,199 16 %\nGross profit 309,313 245,557 63,756 26 %\nCost of revenue was $82.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $71.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $11.2 million, or 16%. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase of $3.8 million in employee compensation costs, including $0.7 million in equity-based compensation expense, as we added headcount to support our growth. In addition, there was an increase of $2.7 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets and course creation costs, an increase of $2.4 million in author fees, an increase of $1.9 million in hosting and delivery costs, and an increase of $1.9 million in depreciation of capitalized software development costs.\nGross profit was $309.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $245.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $63.8 million, or 26%. The increase in gross profit was the result of the increase in our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross margin increased from 77% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 79% for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to a decrease in author fees as a percentage of revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2020 2019 Amount %\n(dollars in thousands)\nSales and marketing $ 238,165 $ 207,085 $ 31,080 15 %\nTechnology and content 118,785 102,902 15,883 15 %\nGeneral and administrative 95,651 85,560 10,091 12 %\nTotal operating expenses $ 452,601 $ 395,547 $ 57,054 14 %\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses were $238.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $207.1 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $31.1 million, or 15%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $41.1 million in employee compensation costs, including $10.5 million in equity-based compensation expense, as we added headcount to support our growth. In addition, there was an increase of $2.3 million in amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $5.6 million in travel expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and an increase of $6.9 million in deferred contract acquisition costs.\nTechnology and Content\nTechnology and content expenses were $118.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $102.9 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $15.9 million, or 15%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $20.4 million in employee compensation costs, including $4.8 million in equity-based compensation, as we added headcount to support our growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.0 million in travel expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase of $1.2 million in capitalized software development costs, and an increase of $1.1 million in capitalized content creation costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $95.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $85.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $10.1 million, or 12%. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $9.5 million in employee compensation costs, as we added headcount to support our growth. In addition, there was an increase of $7.6 million in acquisition-related costs and an increase of $1.7 million in allocated overhead costs primarily driven by our headcount growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $6.5 million in equity-based compensation, as certain stock options granted at the time of the IPO fully vested and a decrease of $2.1 million in travel expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther Income (Expense)\nYear Ended December 31, Change\n2020 2019 Amount %\n(dollars in thousands)\nInterest expense $ (29,322) $ (23,565) $ (5,757) 24 %\nLoss on debt extinguishment - (950) 950 NM\nOther income, net 8,411 11,749 (3,338) (28) %\nInterest expense increased primarily as a result of the interest expense and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs related to the Notes issued in March 2019. We repurchased $40.0 million in aggregate principal of the Notes in September 2019, resulting in the loss on debt extinguishment. Other income, net consists largely of income from our investments. The decline in other income was driven largely by decreases in market interest rates for debt securities.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2020, as well as the percentage of revenue that each line item represents for each quarter. The information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as our audited annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, which consist only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the results of operations for these periods in accordance with GAAP. This data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial\nstatements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for a full year or any future period.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2019 June 30,\n2019 Sept. 30,\n2019 Dec. 31,\n2019 March 31,\n2020 June 30,\n2020 Sept. 30,\n2020 Dec. 31,\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRevenue $ 69,617 $ 75,862 $ 82,620 $ 88,811 $ 92,646 $ 94,765 $ 99,465 $ 104,989\nCost of revenue (1)(2)\n16,712 17,803 17,829 19,009 19,008 19,717 20,426 23,401\nGross profit 52,905 58,059 64,791 69,802 73,638 75,048 79,039 81,588\nOperating expenses (1)(2):\nSales and marketing 44,171 50,046 55,797 57,071 62,415 57,759 57,206 60,785\nTechnology and content 20,271 24,819 27,847 29,965 30,144 29,514 29,345 29,782\nGeneral and administrative 22,191 20,575 20,844 21,950 23,371 22,996 20,366 28,918\nTotal operating expenses 86,633 95,440 104,488 108,986 115,930 110,269 106,917 119,485\nLoss from operations (33,728) (37,381) (39,697) (39,184) (42,292) (35,221) (27,878) (37,897)\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense (1,678) (7,346) (7,412) (7,129) (7,149) (7,241) (7,409) (7,523)\nLoss on debt extinguishment -

This amount does not include $25.0 million we spent in January 2021 in connection with the acquisition of Next Tech, subject to customary working capital adjustments that are expected to be finalized within 90 days of the closing date. Our cash equivalents and investments are comprised primarily of highly liquid investments in money market funds, U.S. treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, commercial paper, and corporate debt securities. Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities, long-term debt facilities, and our net cash provided by operating activities.\nOur free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2020 was negative as a result of our continued investments to support the growth of our business. We expect to continue such investments in order to sustain our growth. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash balances, will enable us to make such investments for the foreseeable future. We expect our free cash flow to improve as we experience greater scale in our business and improve operational efficiency. We expect to generate positive free cash flow over the long term.\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments, as well as our projected cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our pace of growth, subscription renewal activity, the timing and extent of spend to support the expansion of sales and marketing activities, technology and content efforts, the continuing market acceptance of our platform, and future acquisitions. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nIn connection with the IPO and our UP-C structure, we entered into the TRA. As a result of the TRA, we are obligated to pass along some of these tax benefits and cash flows by making future payments to the TRA Members. Although the actual timing and amount of any payments we make to the TRA Members under the TRA will vary, such payments may be significant. Any payments we make to TRA Members under the TRA will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us and, to the extent that we are unable to make payments under the TRA for any reason, the unpaid amounts generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. To date, we have not made any payments under the TRA. We do not expect to make or accrue payments to TRA Members in the near future as payments to TRA members are not owed until the tax benefits generated by TRA Members are more-likely-than-not to be realized.\nThe following table shows cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 9,090 $ (11,729) $ (5,896)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities 4,545 (616,721) (12,136)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 18,426 536,760 200,789\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 449 50 (163)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 32,510 $ (91,640) $ 182,594\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $9.1 million was primarily due to a net loss of $164.1 million and an unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities of $2.2 million, offset by equity-based compensation of $99.9 million, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $27.1 million,\namortization of deferred contract acquisition costs of $25.9 million, depreciation of property and equipment of $12.3 million, and amortization of acquired intangible assets of $6.3 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs of $35.0 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $17.0 million, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $10.4 million, partially offset by a increase in deferred revenue of $41.1 million, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $17.9 million, and a decrease in right-of-use assets of $5.6 million.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $11.7 million was primarily due to a net loss of $163.6 million, partially offset by equity-based compensation of $90.4 million, amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs of $23.6 million, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $21.7 million, depreciation of property and equipment of $9.5 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $4.5 million, and a favorable change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.8 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of $62.2 million, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $5.9 million, and a decrease in right-of-use assets of $5.6 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $37.3 million, an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs of $27.7 million, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $6.7 million, and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets $5.7 million.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $5.9 million was primarily due to a net loss of $146.8 million, partially offset by equity-based compensation of $72.5 million, a favorable change in operating assets and liabilities of $43.4 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $8.7 million, depreciation of property and equipment of $8.3 million, debt extinguishment costs of $4.2 million, amortization of course creation costs of $2.0 million, and amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs of $1.2 million. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in the deferred revenue balance of $61.6 million and an increase in accrued expenses of $8.0 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $26.2 million.\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $4.5 million was due to proceeds from maturities of short-term investments of $576.6 million, partially offset by purchases of investments of $491.3 million, purchase of a business for net cash of $37.5 million, purchases of property and equipment of $35.4 million, and purchases of our content library of $7.8 million. The increase in purchases of property and equipment was largely due to cash paid for the construction of tenant improvements at our new global headquarters in Utah, which was approximately $24.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $616.7 million was primarily due to purchases of investments of $694.2 million, the purchase of a business of $163.8 million, purchases of property and equipment of $11.2 million, and purchases of our content library of $5.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities of short-term investments of $252.8 million and proceeds from the sale of investments of $5.0 million.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $12.1 million was related to purchases of property and equipment of $8.8 million and purchases of our content library of $3.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $18.4 million was due to proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans of $26.4 million, partially offset by taxes paid related to net share settlement of $8.0 million.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $536.8 million was primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes of $616.7 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans of $24.8 million, partially offset by the purchase of Capped Calls of $69.4 million and the repurchases of the Notes of $35.0 million.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $200.8 million was due to net proceeds from the IPO of $332.1 million, borrowings of long-term debt of $20.0 million, and proceeds from\nissuance of common stock from employee equity plans of $13.4 million, partially offset by repayments of long-term debt of $137.7 million, taxes paid related to net share settlement of $16.9 million, and payments of costs related to the IPO of $7.1 million.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments and contractual obligations consist of obligations under leases for office facilities.

As a result of the exchanges made under our structure, we may incur a TRA liability, however, we have not and do not expect to record a TRA liability until the tax benefits associated with the exchanges are more-likely-than-not to be realized. Had the tax benefits been more-likely-than-not to be realized, the estimated incremental TRA liability that could result from past exchanges would have been $345.1 million as of December 31, 2020.\nOn December 11, 2020, in connection with the execution into the Merger Agreement, Pluralsight and Pluralsight Holdings entered into an amendment to the TRA (the \u201cTRA Amendment\u201d). The TRA Amendment establishes that the parties to the TRA will be entitled to receive an aggregate amount of $127.0 million in connection with the closing of the Merger in full satisfaction of Pluralsight\u2019s payment obligation under the TRA in connection with a change of control of Pluralsight. As this payment is subject to the closing of the Merger, a TRA liability is not recorded as of December 31, 2020.\nPurchase orders, which represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements, are not included in the table above. The other contractual obligation amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without significant penalty are not included in the table above.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements in which we may agree to indemnify customers, vendors, lessors, partners, lenders, equity interest holders, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including losses resulting from claims of intellectual property infringement, damages to property or persons, business losses, or other liabilities. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors, executive officers, and other officers that will require us to indemnify them against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers, or employees. No demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements and there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThrough December 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management\u2019s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management\u2019s judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive a substantial majority of our revenue from subscription services (which include support services) by providing customers access to our platform.\nWe implemented the provisions of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2014-09 (referred to collectively as \"ASC 606\") effective January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method as discussed below under the section \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\"\nFollowing the adoption of ASC 606, we recognize revenue when control of these services is transferred to its customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the services. Sales and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenue. We account for revenue contracts with customers by applying the following steps:\n\u2022identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n\u2022identification of the performance obligations in a contract;\n\u2022determination of the transaction price;\n\u2022allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u2022recognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.\nOur subscription arrangements generally do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the platform and, as a result, are accounted for as service arrangements. Access to our platform represents a series of distinct services as we continually provide access to, and fulfills our obligation to, the end customer over the subscription term. The series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time. Accordingly, the fixed consideration related to subscription revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term, beginning on the date that the service is made available to the customer. Our subscription contracts typically vary from one month to three years. Our arrangements are generally noncancellable and nonrefundable.\nSubscriptions that allow the customer to take software on-premise without significant penalty are treated as time-based licenses. These arrangements generally include access to the software over the license term, access to unspecified future product updates, maintenance, and support. Revenue for on-premise software subscriptions is recognized at a point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue for access to unspecified\nfuture products, maintenance and support included with on-premise software subscriptions is recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the date that the software is made available to the customer.\nWe also derive revenue from providing professional services, which generally consist of consulting, integration, or other services, such as instructor-led training and content creation. These services are distinct from subscription services. Revenue from professional services is generally recognized as services are performed.\nSome contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately, if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine standalone selling prices considering market conditions and based on overall pricing objectives such as observable standalone selling prices, and other factors, including the value of contracts, types of services sold, customer demographics, and the number and types of users within such contracts.\nCapitalized Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs incurred in connection with the development of our platform and software used in operations. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once software has reached the development stage, internal and external costs of application development are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. We capitalized costs of $9.8 million, $8.5 million, and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, which were included in property and equipment. Maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe incur equity-based compensation expense primarily from incentive units, RSUs, stock options, and purchase rights issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP. Equity awards to employees are measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the fair value of the award on the grant date. For awards subject to service conditions only, the fair value of the award on the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. For awards subject to both service and performance conditions, we record expense when the performance condition becomes probable. Expense is recognized using the accelerated attribution method (on a tranche-by-tranche basis) for awards with a graded vesting schedule that are subject to both service and performance conditions. We record forfeitures related to equity-based compensation for our awards based on actual forfeitures as they occur.\nThe grant date fair value of RSUs is determined using the market closing price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. RSUs granted prior to the IPO vest upon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a liquidity condition. The liquidity condition was satisfied by the IPO, following the expiration of the lock-up period, which occurred in November 2018. Awards granted subsequent to the IPO are not subject to the liquidity condition. Prior to the IPO, we had not recorded any equity-based compensation expense associated with the RSUs as the liquidity condition was not deemed probable. Following the completion of the IPO, we recorded a cumulative adjustment to equity-based compensation expense totaling $17.1 million. The remaining unrecognized equity-based compensation expense related to RSUs granted prior to the IPO will be recognized over the remaining requisite service period, using the accelerated attribution method. RSUs granted subsequent to the IPO subject to service conditions only will be recognized over the remaining requisite service period, using the straight-line method.\nEquity-based compensation expense for Class A common stock options granted to employees is recognized based on the fair value of the awards granted, determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nEquity-based compensation expense related to purchase rights issued under the ESPP is based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model fair value of the estimated number of awards as of the beginning of the offering period. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized following the straight-line attribution method over the offering period.\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model is affected by the share price and a number of assumptions, including the award\u2019s expected life, risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the underlying stock, and expected dividends. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes pricing model are estimated as follows:\n\u2022Fair Value of Common Stock: We determine the fair value of common stock as of each grant date using the market closing price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant.\n\u2022Risk-free Interest Rate: The risk-free interest rate is derived from the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the options.\n\u2022Expected Term: The expected term is estimated using the simplified method due to a lack of historical exercise activity for us. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the mid-point between the vesting date and the contractual expiration date of the award. For the ESPP, we use the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period.\n\u2022Volatility: The price volatility factor is based on the historical volatilities of comparable companies as we do not have sufficient trading history for our common stock. To determine comparable companies, we consider public enterprise cloud-based application providers and select those that are similar in size, stage of life cycle, and financial leverage. We will continue to use this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding volatility becomes available, or until circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer relevant, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.\n\u2022Dividend Yield: We have not and do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe also recorded equity-based compensation expense when we or a holder of an economic interest in us purchases shares from an employee for an amount in excess of the fair value of the common units at the time of purchase. We recognize any excess value transferred in these transactions as equity-based compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition. We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value and useful lives of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital.\nContent Library, Intangible Assets, and Goodwill\nThe content library assets have been acquired from our network of independent authors (course creation costs) and through various business combinations. We amortize the content library and other intangible assets acquired from our authors or in business combinations on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is generally five years.\nPeriodically we assess potential impairment of our long-lived assets, which include our content library and intangible assets. We perform an impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future results of operations, significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or our overall business strategy, and significant industry or economic trends. When we determine that the carrying value of a long-lived asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators, we determine the recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to net future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is\nexpected to generate and recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. We test goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We initially assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of our sole reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform a quantitative analysis by comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, an impairment charge is recorded. In assessing the qualitative factors, we consider the impact of certain key factors including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, management turnover, changes in regulation, litigation matters, changes in enterprise value, and overall financial performance.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to Pluralsight, Inc.\u2019s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nSocial Impact\nWe believe technology has the power to create freedom, equality, and opportunity around the globe.

Pluralsight One also issued a statewide product grant to support 10,000 K-12 educators and staff with technology skills development. Pluralsight One committed over $1 million in COVID-19 emergency response grants in support\nof partners and regional emergency response efforts and joined UNESCO\u2019s Global Education Coalition and Global Skills Academy in support of their goal to provide learning opportunities to one million youth experiencing disruptions to their learning due to COVID by summer of 2021.\nTwo of our co-founders, Aaron Skonnard and Frederick Onion, have donated and may donate in the future a portion of their Pluralsight equity to the Pluralsight One fund, Silicon Valley Community Foundation a corporate advised fund owned and operated by a 501(c)(3) public charity operated in the United States, EIN# 20-5205488. We have advisory privileges over the fund, with the ability to recommend investment strategy of the donated assets, and the ability to recommend cash grants to support qualified charities, however we do not control the Pluralsight One Fund sponsors, and accordingly we do not consolidate the donor advised fund\u2019s activities into our consolidated financial statements.\nMore information regarding Pluralsight One and our annual impact report is available on our website at https://www.pluralsightone.org/impact.

While we do not have a formal policy with respect to diversity, our nominating and corporate governance committee may consider such factors as differences in professional background, education, skill, race, ethnicity, gender, age and other individual qualities and attributes that contribute to the total mix of viewpoints and experience represented on the board of directors. Our board of directors is committed to seeking out qualified women and individuals from underrepresented groups and diverse backgrounds. Our nominating and corporate governance committee has, from time to time, engaged an executive search firm to assist in identifying and recruiting potential candidates for membership on our board of directors.\nOur nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates each individual in the context of the membership of the board of directors as a group, with the objective of having a group that can best perpetuate the success of the business and represent stockholder interests through the exercise of sound judgment using its diversity of background and experience in various areas. Each director should be an individual of high character and integrity. The board of directors evaluates the performance of the board of directors and its committees. Our nominating and corporate governance committee reviews self-assessment questionnaires to evaluate the performance of individual members. In determining whether to recommend a director for re-election, our nominating and corporate governance committee also considers the director's past attendance at meetings, participation in and contributions to the activities of the board of directors and the Company and other qualifications and characteristics determined by the board of directors. Each director must ensure that other existing and anticipated future commitments do not materially interfere with the members' service as a director. No director should serve on more than four additional public company boards without the approval of our board of directors.\nAfter completing their review and evaluation of director candidates, in accordance with Nasdaq Rules, our nominating and corporate governance committee will recommend a director nominee for selection by our board of directors. Our board of directors has the final authority in determining the selection of director candidates for nomination to our board of directors.\nExecutive Officers\nThe following table provides information regarding our executive officers as of February 11, 2021. Officers are appointed by our board of directors to hold office until their successors are appointed and qualified.\nName Age Position(s)\nAaron Skonnard 48 Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman\nJames Budge 54 Chief Financial Officer\nRoss Meyercord 52 Chief Revenue Officer\nMatthew Forkner 46 Chief Legal Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary\nFor Mr. Skonnard\u2019s biography, please see \"Board of Directors and Corporate Governance-Directors Serving on Our Board\" above.\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics\nOur board of directors has adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics, or Code of Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors, including our Chief Executive Officer who is our principal executive officer, Chief Financial Officer, who is our principal financial officer and our principal accounting officer, and other executive and senior financial officers. The full text of our Code of Conduct and Ethics is available on the corporate governance section of our website, which is located at http://investors.pluralsight.com. The nominating and corporate governance committee of our board of directors is responsible for overseeing the Code of Conduct and Ethics and must approve any waivers of the Code of Conduct and Ethics for employees, executive officers and directors. We intend to disclose any amendments to our Code of Conduct and Ethics, or waivers of its requirements, on our website or in filings under the Exchange Act.\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, as well as any person or entity who owns more than 10% of a registered class of our common stock or other equity securities, to file with the SEC certain reports of ownership and changes in ownership of our securities. Executive officers, directors and stockholders who hold more than 10% of our outstanding common stock are required by the SEC to furnish us with copies of all required forms filed under Section 16(a). We typically prepare Section 16(a) forms on behalf of our executive officers and directors based on the information provided by them.\nBased solely on review of this information and written representations by our executive officers and directors that no other reports were required, we believe that, during fiscal year 2020, no reporting person failed to file the forms required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act on a timely basis other than the following exceptions: Board member Ms. Terrell submitted a late filing on September 18, 2020 and Mr. Meyercord submitted a late filing on November 2, 2020."

Slack offers a secure, enterprise-grade environment that can scale with the largest organizations in the world. It is a new layer of the business technology stack where people can work together more effectively, connect all their other software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work. Slack is where work happens.\nThe most helpful explanation of Slack is often that it replaces the use of email inside the organization. Like email (or the Internet or electricity), Slack has very general and broad applicability. It is not aimed at any one specific purpose, but nearly anything that people do together at work. Slack is used to review job candidates, coordinate election coverage, diagnose network problems, negotiate budgets, plan marketing campaigns, approve menus, and organize disaster response teams, along with countless other tasks.\nUnlike email, however, most of this activity happens in team-based channels, rather than in individual inboxes. Channels offer a persistent record of the conversations, data, documents, and application workflows relevant to a project or a topic. Membership of a channel can change over time as people join or leave a project or organization, and users benefit from the accumulated historical information in a way an employee never could when starting with an empty email inbox. Depending on the size of the organization, this might provide tens, hundreds, or even thousands of times more access to information than is available to individuals working in environments where email is the primary means of communication. Slack also enables communication and collaboration among organizations via shared channels and guest accounts, and the associated network effect increases the value of Slack both for organizations on Slack and organizations new to Slack.\nAlso unlike email, Slack was designed from the ground up to integrate with external software systems. Slack provides an easy way for users to share and aggregate information from other software, take action on notifications, and advance workflows in a multitude of third-party applications, over 2,450 of which are listed in the Slack App Directory. Further, Slack\u2019s platform capabilities extend beyond integrations with third-party applications and allow for easy integrations with an organization\u2019s internally-developed software. Developers have collectively created more than 850,000 third-party applications or custom integrations that were used in a typical week during the three months ended January 31, 2021. In 2019, we introduced Workflow Builder, a low-code solution to create integrations and workflows entirely in Slack, suitable for all users and based on a simple, non-technical user interface.\nUltimately, Slack is more than email replacement. It is a new layer of the business technology stack that brings together people, applications, and data. Just as an operating system coordinates the flow of information and resources of a computer in a centralized fashion, using Slack inside an organization and across organizations creates a hub into which critical business information flows, is acted upon and transformed, and is then quickly routed to its desired destination. Slack streamlines our users\u2019 workflows, increases the beneficial return on the time they spend communicating, and creates a powerful point of leverage for increased productivity.\nSummary of Key Benefits\nWorking in Slack provides several key benefits to users, teams, and organizations and to our platform ecosystem:\n\u2022People love using Slack and that leads to high levels of engagement. Slack is enterprise software created with an eye for user experience usually associated with consumer products. We believe that the more simple, enjoyable, and intuitive the product is, the more people will want to use it. As a result, teams benefit from the aggregated attention that happens when all members of a team are engaged in a single collaboration tool.\n\u2022Slack increases an organization\u2019s \u201creturn on communication.\u201d Moving to channel-based communication increases accessibility of communication, which in turn increases transparency and breaks down silos. The organization benefits from increased coordination and alignment from a given amount of communication, with no additional effort in the form of status reports, update meetings, and so on.\n\u2022Slack increases the value of existing software investment. As a flexible platform for routing information of all kinds, Slack integrates horizontally with thousands of other applications, from those provided by companies like Google, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Atlassian, and Dropbox to the proprietary line-of-business applications developed by organizations for their own internal use. Integration with Slack increases both the accessibility of information inside applications and the response times for many basic actions. Because Slack users can do virtually everything on Slack on mobile that they can do on desktop, they do not need to have dozens of work applications on their mobile devices to be able to make lightweight use of those applications on the go.\n\u2022An organization\u2019s archive of data increases in value over time. As teams continue to use Slack, they build a valuable resource of widely accessible information. Important messages are surrounded by useful context and users can see how fellow team members created and worked with the information and arrived at a decision. New employees can have instant access to the information they need to be effective whenever they join a new team or company. Finally, the content on Slack is available through powerful search and discovery tools, powered by machine learning, which improve through usage.\n\u2022Slack helps organizations improve culture and employees\u2019 feelings of empowerment. When every member of a team learns from, and contributes towards, common goals, people feel they have greater influence over the ultimate outcomes of their work. By keeping all team members in the information flow, we believe that Slack increases this sense that members of a team can have an impact and make a difference and that creates greater team cohesion and increases motivation.\n\u2022Slack helps achieve organizational agility. Slack\u2019s channels immerse workers directly into the dynamic and evolving communication, decision making, and data flow that defines modern work. Because workers have both more access to data updated in real time and more context for that data, they are better able to quickly react and adjust work streams in response to new business priorities or changing conditions while staying in alignment with one another. This same organizational agility extends outside an organization with Slack Connect, integrating conversations and work streams with partners in shared channels and enabling broader alignment.\n\u2022Developers are better able to reach and deliver value to their customers. Slack has aggregated hundreds of thousands of organizations on one platform and made it easier for developers to distribute their software to any Slack-using organization. By making information from their applications available and allowing users to perform key actions through a whole new interface, developers can make their customers happier and more engaged.\nOur Business Model\nFrom the outset, our go-to-market strategy has centered around offering an exceptional product and level of service to organizations on Slack. We have both a self-service offering and a direct sales force to address customers who do not want to buy through the self-serve model or who need the additional capabilities of our enterprise products. Our direct sales force and customer success professionals focus on driving successful adoption and expansion within organizations. We believe deep user engagement and an obsessive focus on customer experience are catalysts for expanding paid adoption within organizations.\nWe define an organization on Slack as a separate entity, such as a company, educational or government institution, or distinct business unit of a company, that is on a subscription plan, whether free or paid. Once an organization has three or more users on a paid subscription plan, we count them as a Paid Customer.\nAs of January 31, 2021, Slack had more than 756,000 organizations with three or more users, comprised of:\n\u2022More than 600,000 organizations on our Free subscription plan; and\n\u2022More than 156,000 Paid Customers.\nMany of these Paid Customers have thousands of active users and our largest Paid Customers have more than one hundred thousand employees using Slack on a regular basis. The number of organizations on Slack is highly diversified, and during the years ended January 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, no Paid Customer accounted for more than 3% of our revenue.\nOur users, whether on a free or paid subscription plan, are highly engaged, and their collective active use of Slack for the week ended January 31, 2021 exceeded 105 million hours. During the week ended January 31, 2021, more than 2.2 billion messages were sent in Slack. During this same time, on a typical workday, users at Paid Customers averaged more than ten hours connected to Slack through at least one device and spent more than 110 minutes actively using Slack. We believe that this broad, active user base and deep user engagement propel increased adoption within organizations and inspire many organizations to become Paid Customers.\nOur direct sales and customer success efforts are focused on larger organizations who have a greater number of users and teams and have the potential to increase spend over time. As our business has matured, we have seen a growth in sales through our direct sales force. We measure the number of Paid Customers > $100,000 of annual recurring revenue, or ARR, as a gauge of adoption within and expansion into large enterprises. As of January 31, 2021, we had 1,183 Paid Customers >$100,000 of ARR, which accounted for approximately 49% of our revenue in fiscal year 2021.\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of subscriptions for Slack. Paid customers typically pay on a monthly or annual basis, based on the number of users that they have on Slack.\nWhat Sets Us Apart\nSingular focus\nOur development, design, partnerships, customer engagement, and investments are targeted at realizing the enormity and simplicity of Slack\u2019s singular mission: to make people\u2019s working lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive. We have no legacy products or competing priorities. We believe our platform has broad enough utility and a large enough market that we can remain focused indefinitely.\nScale and market leadership\nThe strength of our market leadership is demonstrated by the scale and growth of our users, the high level of engagement within our user base, our growth within organizations, the breadth of applications that integrate with Slack, and the size of our developer ecosystem. We believe we know more about how organizations use platforms like Slack than anyone else in the world and will put this knowledge to work faster.\nStrong increasing returns dynamics\nAs Slack usage increases inside an organization, more value is created for each additional user who might join, as well as for all existing users. As organizations continue to use Slack over time, the value of their archive increases and they realize more utility in their usage. We believe shared channels between organizations will increase the value of the overall Slack network for each new organization that joins as well as for all existing network members. Slack also generates more value for developers as more users and more organizations join Slack, and users and organizations are more attracted to Slack as more apps are integrated into or built on our platform.\nCustomer love leading to stickiness and organic expansion\nPeople love using Slack and many become advocates for wider use inside their organizations. They also tend to recommend Slack when they switch jobs or join organizations that are not yet using Slack. There are thousands of\ntweets and other public endorsements or recommendations of Slack, a source of growth that is exceptional in enterprise software.\nDifferentiated go-to-market strategy\nOrganic growth is generated as users realize the benefits of Slack. This growth enables us to attract new and prospective organizations through an effective self-service customer engagement model for free and paid subscription plans. We also employ direct sales efforts targeted at new organizations and organizations with existing organic adoption of Slack. Once prospective organizations are identified, our direct sales and customer success teams work to broaden adoption of Slack into wider-scale deployments.\nCustomer-centricity as the fundamental tenet of our company\nWe build our software and user interface around the real needs of human beings. We aim for radical convenience and do our best to anticipate the needs of our users. Empathy and respect for users is built into our company values and this mindset extends to our broader sales and customer engagement model. We focus on customer support for free and paid subscription plans and treat it as a critical and strategic imperative for our company. We believe people should leave every interaction with a Slack representative feeling that they have been heard, respected, and helped by a human being who truly understands Slack and the experience of depending on it for work. This quality of service has a real impact on user behavior: based on our internal data, users who interact with our customer experience team are eight times more likely to become paid users than those who do not.\nOur Service\nSlack is a new layer of the business technology stack where people can work together more effectively, connect all their other software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work.\nSlack\u2019s key functionality\n\u2022Messaging and Channels: Slack users communicate with one another by posting messages to a channel or sending direct messages to a person or a group of people. Slack\u2019s core organizing principle is the channel, which brings the right people together to collaborate, share information, and get work done. Channels offer flexibility and can be organized by project, topic, team, or whatever makes sense for a specific task or situation. Public channels are accessible to all users within a Slack workspace. For more exclusive workstreams and conversations, users create invite-only channels.\nWithin channels, users post messages, documents, and images and interact with other software. Users can search for information about a topic or project, find a relevant channel, join it, and scroll through the channel\u2019s entire history, finding messages and contextual content. Slack enables users to optimize the way they use the service, allowing users to choose when to receive notifications and customize alerts by person, keyword, channel, or application.\n\u2022Integrations: Through integrations with both third-party and internally-built software applications, users of Slack are able to easily access and interact in their channels with information from other applications. We believe this makes Slack users more productive at work and increases the value of other software programs. For example, a user may look up customer account information in Salesforce or get updates on deployment status through GitHub within Slack. More advanced use cases include the ability to design custom workflows, which can automatically perform a series of tasks and actions in Slack in otherwise unconnected software applications. For example, creating a customer service ticket routing application that brings together information from a Zendesk ticket, customer data from Salesforce, and suggested solutions from an internally-built knowledge base - all without leaving Slack.\n\u2022Shared Channels: Slack enables communication and collaboration among organizations via shared channels and guest accounts. Shared channels, also called Slack Connect, securely connect the Slack workspaces of different organizations, enabling the same level of communication and collaboration between enterprises that Slack brings to teams within an organization. Shared channels can be public or\ninvite-only and contain all of the powerful tools and integrations of Slack along with an added layer of administrative capabilities to regulate and monitor the flow of information between organizations. Guest accounts allow workspace owners to invite people from outside their organizations to join one or more channels.\nAs of January 31, 2021, more than 74,000 Paid Customers have adopted shared channels using Slack Connect. We believe adoption of this feature will grow significantly in the coming years, both in terms of network participants and network density. Because the associated network effect increases the value of Slack both for organizations on Slack and organizations new to Slack, we expect Slack Connect to create more utility for existing users and be an important factor in future growth.\n\u2022Search: Everything in Slack, including messages, posts from applications, and text content of files is searchable, so that permissioned users can tap into company knowledge and find information when they need it. Over time, use of Slack creates an archive of information generated by an organization that is universally available, persistent and contextual, making Slack\u2019s search function increasingly useful. Our search capability offers a range of filters and modifiers to allow users easy and efficient access to specific knowledge from potentially vast repositories of information. We also leverage machine learning to deliver personalized search results based on user behavior and context, such as the people a user may communicate with most often, the files that may be most relevant to the user and the channels in which the user tends to participate.\nOur Subscription Plans\nWe offer four subscription plans to serve the varying needs of our users: Free, Standard, Plus, and Enterprise Grid.\nOur Free, Standard, and Plus subscription plans consist of a single workspace, which we define as a Slack environment configured for a team. These plans are most often adopted by small and medium sized teams. From time to time, we provide additional features and functionality, such as enterprise key management, to meet specialized requirements of organizations on Slack.\nOur Enterprise Grid plan is uniquely designed for larger organizations, which typically are more complex and require enhanced functionality, flexibility, administrative control, and security at scale. Enterprise Grid allows paid customers to:\n\u2022create and manage an unlimited set of connected workspaces and channels;\n\u2022search across multiple workspaces, making it easy for workers and administrators to tap into their organization\u2019s collective knowledge at scale;\n\u2022access centralized controls to ensure a company\u2019s data remains secure, giving administrators a single point of visibility to provision and manage Slack; and\n\u2022integrate with third-party e-Discovery and data loss prevention tools to help meet security and compliance requirements.\nThe Slack Platform\nOur technology platform was purpose built to enable independent software developers and organizations to integrate existing software with Slack or build entirely new applications that provide new features for Slack users. We believe that the power of Slack is amplified through integration with third-party and internal software, providing easy, intuitive access to a broad range of applications. Our platform consists of a set of open, documented APIs, developer tools, and an App Directory that lists apps that have met our guidelines. Organizations on Slack use our platform to create internal applications and integrations, ranging from simple notifications to complex internal workflows. Third-party developers build integrations and applications that make it easier for their existing customers to engage with their products as well as find new customers. In 2019, we introduced Workflow Builder, a low-code\nsolution to create integrations and workflows entirely in Slack, suitable for all users and based on a simple, non-technical user interface.\nOur App Directory lists applications and integrations that address virtually all aspects of knowledge work. These applications and integrations connect Slack users with software from some of the world\u2019s largest technology companies to some of the smallest startups.\nWe foster our platform ecosystem through our dedicated Slack API site, open source forums, software development kits, global developer events, partnerships, and technical support for developers building for their own companies or aiming to list their apps in our App Directory.\nOur Sales and Marketing Approach\nWe combine a web-based, self-service go-to-market approach with direct sales efforts that focus on growing users within larger organizations and acquiring new large paid customers. We believe that these go-to-market approaches reinforce one another; self-service users often become leads for our direct sales force and users within larger enterprises create organic awareness of Slack inside and outside their organizations. We complement these sales and marketing activities with an obsessive focus on customer experience and customer success.\nSelf-service adoption and marketing\nMany organizations adopt Slack initially as part of our self-service go-to-market approach. We deploy a range of marketing strategies and tactics to drive initial awareness and adoption. These include brand advertising, public relations, digital marketing campaigns, free trials of our paid plans, product localization, in-product customer education, and a website designed to teach new users about Slack.\nOrganizations on Slack are diverse, and range from businesses to non-governmental organizations, universities, sports clubs, and open source communities. They often start by using our free version. We believe free usage helps create champions of Slack, and as these prospective paid customers realize the value of Slack, they spread the word organically throughout their networks and organizations.\nAs organizations engage more deeply with Slack, both through using Slack for collaboration and communication and integrating more third-party and internally-developed software via our platform, they often upgrade to paid plans via our website. Organizations also upgrade to paid plans to utilize features such as shared channels and enhanced security and administration capabilities. We support this upgrade path through targeted marketing campaigns and in-product prompts highlighting the added benefits and features of our paid plans.\nDirect sales and marketing\nTo increase adoption within larger paid customers and acquire new paid customers, we utilize a direct sales organization. Our direct sales force often leverages the Slack champions and proofs of concept developed through self-service adoption. We combine this bottoms-up demand with direct sales efforts targeted at C-suite executives and business unit leaders.\nThese efforts include a globally distributed direct sales force, solutions engineering, demand generation campaigns, webinars, analyst relations, C-suite events, and cooperative marketing efforts with our partners. We also host an annual user conference, Frontiers, where we bring together organizations and partners around the world to share best practices on achieving organizational alignment, unveil the latest Slack features, educate users, and embrace our growing application developer and platform ecosystem.\nCustomer experience and customer success\nOur customer experience team provides support to users of both free and paid versions of Slack and is core to enhancing user adoption, free-to-paid conversion, and subscription renewal. Additionally, our customer experience team receives and quantifies feedback from organizations on Slack at scale. This focus on responsiveness and personal touch helps us optimize customer satisfaction and identify high-value opportunities for both user-facing and internal product improvements.\nOur educational offerings include a range of free, web-based classes and tutorials on how to use, administer, optimize, and customize Slack, as well as how to integrate other applications, build custom workflows, and build entirely new applications on Slack. We also offer in-person training through our developer relations program and at events for organizations on Slack.\nOur customer success team supports larger organizations through every step of their journey with Slack. This starts with supporting onboarding, workspace best practices, change management, and education, and continues with renewals and expansion to other functional teams, departments, or business units. In addition, we offer professional services tailored to the needs of organizations on Slack.\nOur Partnerships\nSlack has a robust and diverse partner ecosystem that includes leading enterprise software companies, security providers, systems integrators, and new, emerging companies. Our partner ecosystem extends and enhances Slack through integrations and operates as an important component of our go-to-market strategy. Partners serve as a source of enterprise sales leads and help to accelerate our sales cycles through co-selling and services delivery. Our partners benefit from growth in customer engagement with their products and services and new opportunities to grow their users and customers.\nSlack Fund\nInvesting is also a component of our partnerships strategy. Slack Fund L.L.C., or the Slack Fund, is an investment fund that we initially started, in partnership with entities affiliated with certain of our stockholders: Accel, Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Social Capital, and Spark Capital. We created the fund to support companies building applications on the Slack platform and other applications that are focused on the next generation of enterprise software. By the end of fiscal year 2021, Slack Fund invested all of the capital initially committed by Slack and our partners. In March 2021, we purchased all the outstanding LLC interests from the other Slack Fund members, and Slack currently owns all of the LLC interests in Slack Fund. We have invested and will continue to invest in start-up companies that we believe enhance the value of Slack and that are focused on the future of work, with funding for these investments coming solely from Slack.\nHuman Capital\nAt Slack, our goal is to make people\u2019s working lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive - not only for our users but also for our own workforce. We believe that the success of our workforce is critical to the success of our business. Slack\u2019s culture is rooted in a sense of belonging, encouraging personal and professional growth, and the ability to empathize and relate to one another.\nAs of January 31, 2021, we had 2,545 full-time employees. We supplement our workforce with contractors and consultants. In June 2020, we announced that we would allow many of our employees to work remotely on a permanent basis. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur compensation program is designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business, contribute to our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with competitive compensation packages that include base salary, short-term annual incentive bonuses and long-term equity compensation. We also provide our employees with comprehensive employee benefit programs, such as medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan, and life and disability insurance.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe are committed to embedding diversity, engagement and belonging in our workplace and in our hiring practices. We are focused on building an inclusive culture and sustaining a diverse workforce through a variety of company initiatives. As part of that effort we have a number of executive-sponsored employee resource groups that\nprovide support for diverse members of our workforce by fostering an inclusive environment and providing professional development and community-building opportunities. In addition, we provide resources and training to employees at all levels to ensure that we are hiring, promoting and retaining diverse teams, as well as sponsor a number of professional development programs to support the advance of underrepresented employees at Slack. We also publish an annual diversity report to share our data and evaluate our approaches.\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\nOur success is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and wellness programs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes such as facilitating teleworking that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate. We continue to evolve our programs to meet our employees\u2019 health and wellness needs.\nSlack for Good\nPart of our culture is what we refer to as Slack for Good. Slack for Good\u2019s principal focus is to increase the representation of people from backgrounds that have been historically under-represented in the technology industry. We have pledged 1% of employee time, 1% of our equity, and 1% of our product to activities associated with Slack for Good. We encourage our employees to volunteer their time to support causes of their choice and provide them with paid time off to do so. We have reserved 1.2 million shares of our Class B common stock for potential future sale to fund and support our social impact initiatives. We also donate money and discount access to our service for non-profit organizations.\nResearch and Development\nWe build our software with the user in mind - we invest substantial time, energy, and resources to ensure we have a deep understanding of the needs of organizations on Slack and we continually innovate on our product. Unlike traditional enterprise software, we aim to release new features to users and organizations on Slack as quickly as possible through internal testing releases and external beta cycles to ensure that we are constantly receiving feedback. We leverage the power of our expansive user base and our focused customer service philosophy to collect feedback on product features to enhance our development process.\nResearch and development expenses were $382.1 million, $457.4 million, and $157.5 million, including stock-based compensation of $115.0 million, $226.5 million, and $9.9 million, for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nTechnology Infrastructure and Operations\nWe have built our technology infrastructure using a distributed and scalable architecture on a global scale.\nWe designed our technology platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability and low latency. Incremental backups are performed hourly and full backups are performed daily. In addition, redundant copies of content are stored in at least two geographically separate regions and are replicated within each region. Data is transmitted in encrypted form and encrypted when stored in our system. We use Amazon Web Services, or AWS, as our processing and delivery infrastructure.\nWe have built a network operations infrastructure that combines automated, 24x7 telemetry with human monitoring to help ensure that any issues that arise with our service are addressed as quickly as possible. We publish our uptime metrics, system status, and event reports on our public website so that users and organizations know how our systems are performing at any given time.\nSecurity, Privacy, and Data Protection\nTrust is important for our relationship with users and organizations on Slack, and we take significant measures to protect their privacy and data.\nSecurity\nWe devote considerable resources to our security program, which is dedicated to ensuring that organizations on Slack have the highest confidence in our custodianship of their data. Our security program is aligned to the ISO 27000 standards and is regularly audited and assessed by third parties as well as organizations on Slack.\nOur security program consists of the following:\n\u2022Organizational security including security and privacy training, a team of dedicated security professionals, policies and standards, separation of duties, and regular audits, compliance activities, and third-party assessments;\n\u2022Secure by design principles by which we assess the security risk of each software development project according to our secure development lifecycle and create a set of requirements that must be met before the resulting change may be released to production; and\n\u2022Public bug bounty program to facilitate responsible disclosure of potential security vulnerabilities identified by external researchers and reward them for their verified findings.\nThe focus of our security program is to prevent unauthorized access to the data of organizations on Slack. To this end, our team of security practitioners, working in partnership with peers across our company, work to identify and mitigate risks, implement best practices, and continue to evaluate ways to improve. These steps include data encryption in transit and at rest, network security, classifying and inventorying data, limiting and authorizing access controls, and multi-factor authentication for access to systems with data. We also employ regular system monitoring, logging, and alerting to retain and analyze the security state of our corporate and production infrastructure.\nIn addition, our security program has achieved several internationally-recognized certifications and industry standard audited attestations of our security controls, and maintains a number of compliance programs. Slack offers support for HIPAA-regulated organizations that purchase Enterprise Grid.\nWe take appropriate steps to help ensure that our security measures are maintained by the third-party vendors we use, including by conducting security reviews and audits.\nPrivacy and data protection\nThe privacy of users and protection of data is important to Slack\u2019s continued growth and success. Privacy is a shared responsibility among all our employees, but we also have a dedicated privacy and data governance team that builds and executes on our privacy program, including the management of data protection impact assessments. Our privacy and legal teams work together to conduct product and feature reviews, data inventory and mapping, and support for data protection and privacy-related requests.\nWe are committed to complying with, and helping organizations on Slack comply with, data protection laws globally. We monitor guidance from industry and regulatory bodies, meet with regulators and update our product features and contractual commitments accordingly.\nSlack is offered to organizations outside the United States and Canada by Slack Technologies Limited, an Irish company based in Dublin, Ireland, which is subject to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation and the regulatory oversight of the Irish Data Protection Commission. We also maintain a self-certification under the current E.U.-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield programs and offer European Union Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses. See the section titled \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Information Technology, Intellectual Property, and Data Security and Privacy-We may face particular privacy, data security, and data protection risks in Europe particularly due to the European General Data Protection Regulation.\u201d\nWe maintain a privacy policy that describes how Slack collects, uses, and discloses information, and what choices organizations and users have.\nCompetition\nThe market for services like Slack is emerging, rapidly evolving, and fragmented, and we believe that Slack represents a new category of business technology. As a result, we principally compete against collaboration and communication tools and products from established vendors, such as Microsoft, productivity tool and email providers, such as Google, unified communications providers, such as Cisco, and consumer application companies that have entered the business software market, such as Facebook. We also compete with smaller companies that offer niche or point products that attempt to address certain problems that Slack addresses. These smaller companies include companies that specialize in voice or video communication, instant messaging, email filtering, and email inbox organization, business workflows, team-based collaboration, intranet creation and maintenance, and other functionality. Some of these companies offer free or discounted services. We believe that we compete favorably with these smaller companies because they do not offer the unique mix of features and functionality combined with our proven ability to scale to handle large amounts of users, usage, and data. In addition, our market is subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, new market entrants, and frequent introductions of new products and services.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following:\n\u2022ease of adoption, use, and deployment;\n\u2022product functionality;\n\u2022platform capabilities;\n\u2022breadth and depth of platform integrations;\n\u2022scalability, availability and reliability;\n\u2022security and privacy;\n\u2022ability to support intercompany collaboration;\n\u2022brand awareness and reputation;\n\u2022customer support; and\n\u2022total cost of ownership.\nCompetition has intensified in recent periods, and we expect competition to continue to intensify as established and emerging companies continue to enter the markets we serve or attempt to address the problems Slack addresses, as customer requirements evolve, and as new products, technologies, and regulations are introduced. Many of our existing competitors have longer operating histories, larger sales and marketing budgets, access to larger existing user bases, and greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do. In addition, some of our larger competitors, such as Microsoft, have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing Slack, including through offering free products, selling at zero or negative margins, product bundling, forced product migrations, auto-installation of applications, or closed technology platforms. We believe this has confused the market for Slack, lengthened certain sales cycles, and caused certain prospective customers not to purchase Slack. In addition, the product bundling and forced product migrations described above have reduced, and may in the future reduce, the overall market for Slack by preventing us from gaining access to sales opportunities and by forcing us to spend more resources to market and sell Slack. In July 2020, we filed a complaint against Microsoft with the European Commission for engaging in certain behaviors that we believe are unlawful and anti-competitive.

    "item_7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the \u201cSelected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As described in the section titled \u201cNote About Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d this discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d or in other parts of this Annual Statement on Form 10-K. Our fiscal year ends January 31.\nOverview\nSlack is a new layer of the business technology stack where people can work together more effectively, connect all their other software tools and services, and find the information they need to do their best work. Slack has very general and broad applicability. It is not aimed at any one specific purpose, but at nearly anything that people do together at work. Slack is used to review job candidates, coordinate election coverage, diagnose network problems, negotiate budgets, plan marketing campaigns, approve menus, and organize disaster response teams, along with countless other tasks.\nSlack provides an easy way for users to share and aggregate information from other software, take action on notifications, and advance workflows in a multitude of third-party applications, over 2,450 of which are listed in the Slack App Directory. Developers have collectively created more than 850,000 third-party applications or custom integrations that were used in a typical week during the year ended January 31, 2021. Further, Slack\u2019s platform capabilities extend beyond integrations with third-party applications and allow for easy integrations with an organization\u2019s internally-developed software.\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of subscriptions for Slack. Paid customers typically pay on a monthly or annual basis, based on the number of users that they have on Slack. We offer four subscription plans to serve the varying needs of organizations on Slack: Free, Standard, Plus, and Enterprise Grid. We have a fair billing policy under which certain paid customers are charged a fee per user, and their billing is reconciled on a monthly or quarterly basis based on usage. As part of this policy, these paid customers are entitled to a credit if they have not used the entirety of the contracted number of users for which they have paid during the contractual term of the arrangement. Other paid customers have a type of subscription agreement where they are charged a fee based on the number of purchased user subscriptions, but billing is fixed and independent of usage.\nWe serve organizations of all sizes across various industries, ranging from software companies to consumer retail companies, financial services companies, and government entities. Slack is currently used in over 150 countries and available in ten languages (English (U.S.), English (U.K.), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Latin America), and Spanish (Spain)). In the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 39%, 37%, and 36%, respectively, of our revenue was generated outside of the United States.\nOur go-to-market approach combines a web-based, self-service approach with direct sales efforts that focus on growing users within larger organizations that generally already have Slack users and acquiring new large organizations as paid customers. We believe that these go-to-market approaches reinforce one another; self-service users often become leads for our direct sales force and users within larger enterprises create organic awareness of Slack inside and outside of their organizations. We complement these activities with an obsessive focus on customer experience and customer success to support the growth of the number of users on free and paid subscriptions.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. Our revenue was $902.6 million, $630.4 million, and $400.6 million for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, representing annual growth of 43% and 57%, respectively. We generated net losses for the years ended January 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 of $300.4 million, $571.1 million, and $140.7 million, respectively, which included $227.4 million, $426.5 million, and $23.1 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation. Our net losses excluding the impact from stock-based compensation have been decreasing as a percentage of revenue over time as revenue growth has outpaced the\ngrowth in operating expenses. We plan to continue to invest in adding organizations to Slack in order to increase our revenues, decrease our operating losses, and eventually reach profitability. However, there can be no guarantee as to when we will eventually reach profitability, if at all.\nProposed Transaction with Salesforce\nOn December 1, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub I with and into Slack, with Slack continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Salesforce, or the First Merger, immediately followed by a second merger of the surviving corporation into either Merger Sub II or Salesforce, or the Second Merger, with either Merger Sub II or Salesforce continuing as the surviving company.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, all of our issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will be converted into the right to receive (a) 0.0776 shares of Salesforce common stock and (b) $26.79 in cash, without interest. The Mergers are intended to be treated as a single integrated transaction that will qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. As a result of the Mergers, we will cease to be a publicly traded company.\nThe Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants. The consummation of the Mergers is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of our stockholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. Consummation of the Mergers is not subject to a financing condition. In March 2021, our stockholders approved the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Mergers. The Mergers are anticipated to close in the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022 (the quarter ending July 31, 2021), subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals, and other customary closing conditions. We cannot predict with certainty, however, whether and when all of the required closing conditions will be satisfied or if the Mergers will close.\nThe Merger Agreement contains certain customary termination rights for us and Salesforce, including if the First Merger is not consummated by August 1, 2021, subject to two extensions of up to three months each in order to obtain required regulatory approvals. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, including (i) a termination by us to enter into a superior proposal, (ii) a termination by Salesforce following a change or withdrawal of the Company\u2019s board of directors\u2019 recommendation of the Mergers to our stockholders, or (iii) a termination by Salesforce as a result of a material breach of our non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement, then we will be obligated to pay to Salesforce a termination fee equal to $900.0 million in cash.\nAs part of Salesforce after the completion of the Mergers, we expect our company will be positioned to scale and further our mission. Following the completion of the Mergers, Slack will become an operating unit of Salesforce and continue to be led by our Chief Executive Officer, Stewart Butterfield, driving forward a continued focus on our mission, customers, users, and community. See the section titled \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to our Proposed Transaction with Salesforce\u201d included under Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the risks associated with the Mergers.\nThe foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 of our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on December 1, 2020 and incorporated by reference herein.\nCOVID-19 Update\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. This contagious disease outbreak, which has continued to spread, and the related public health measures, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions, and mandated business closures, have adversely affected workforces, organizations, customers, economies, and financial markets globally, leading to an economic downturn and increased market volatility. It has also disrupted the normal operations of many businesses, including ours.\nWe have experienced volatility in customer demand and buying habits due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an increase in net new Paid Customers, but also an increase in paid customer churn and a decrease in expansion within existing paid customers during the year ended January 31, 2021. We expect these paid customer churn and expansion trends to continue due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We define paid customer churn as paid customers reducing the number of users within their organizations or electing not to renew their paid subscriptions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects have been more prevalent in the locations where we, our customers, suppliers, and third-party business partners conduct business. This outbreak, as well as intensified measures undertaken to contain the spread of COVID-19, have decreased IT spending for many organizations, adversely affected demand for Slack including attrition rates, and inhibited the ability of our salespeople to travel to potential customers and of our customer success team to conduct in-person trainings and consulting work. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted spending from certain new and existing customers, increased sales cycle times, negatively impacted collections of accounts receivable, caused certain of our paid customers to file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business, and harmed our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We expect these negative impacts will continue due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, to prepare for potential surges in demand, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, additional costs and make additional investments in order to meet the demands of increased customer usage of Slack and additional product development efforts during this time may put additional pressure on our technical infrastructure. The broader implications of COVID-19 on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and any prolonged economic slowdowns may continue to result in, paid customers on Slack requesting to renegotiate existing contracts on less advantageous terms to us than those currently in place, defaulting on payments due on existing contracts, not renewing at the end of the contract term, or choosing to renew with a smaller commitment than previous contracts. For example, in an effort to assist both new and existing paid customers facing challenges due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, more custom contracts and billing arrangements with new and existing paid customers, which may be less advantageous to us than our standard term contracts. These arrangements have included provisions such as the ability to defer payments, to pay in installments or over longer time periods, and other collection flexibility. We have also granted, and may in the future grant, billing concessions to existing paid customers. We do not expect these billing arrangements to have a significant impact on our future revenue, but they will negatively impact our future Calculated Billings and Free Cash Flow.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also presents challenges as our entire workforce is currently working remotely and shifting to assisting new and existing customers who are also generally working remotely. All of our currently planned customer, employee, and industry events have been shifted to virtual-only experiences, and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone, or cancel entirely, additional customer, partner, employee, or industry events in the future. Furthermore, in June 2020, we announced that we would allow many of our employees to work remotely on a permanent basis. We have a limited history of having a remote workforce and the long-term impact on, and the resulting types of continuing investments for, our employee base is uncertain. In addition, we may incur increased workforce costs, including costs associated with implementing additional personnel and workplace safety protocols, the accrual of unused paid time off, and workplace or labor claims and disputes related to COVID-19.\nWhile we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the potential negative impact of the outbreak on our business, these efforts may not be effective and a protracted economic downturn will likely limit the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts. Due to our subscription-based business model, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods, if at all. We are continuing to understand the long-term net effect and anticipated future magnitude of the above factors on our results for future periods and such forecasts are inherently uncertain. See Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating these key metrics, which may hinder comparability with other companies who may calculate similarly-titled metrics in a different way.\nWe define an organization as a separate entity, such as a company, educational or government institution, or distinct business unit of a company, that is on a subscription plan, whether free or paid. Once an organization has three or more users on a paid subscription plan, we count them as a Paid Customer, and when disclosing the number of Paid Customers, we round down to the nearest thousand.\nAs of January 31,\n2021 2020 2019\nPaid Customers 156,000 110,000 88,000\nPaid Customers >$100,000 1,183 893 575\nNet Dollar Retention Rate 123 % 132 % 143 %\nPaid Customers\nWe believe that the growth in our Paid Customer base reflects our value proposition and positions us for future growth as our Paid Customers often expand their adoption over time and Paid Customers increase awareness of Slack, which leads to organic adoption by new organizations. Our Paid Customers base has expanded through increasing awareness of Slack, further developing our go-to-market strategy and continuing to build features tuned to different industry needs. Our Paid Customer base includes organizations of all sizes across a wide range of industries.\nPaid Customers >$100,000\nWe focus on growing the number of Paid Customers >$100,000 as a measure of our ability to scale with organizations on Slack and attract larger organizations to Slack. We believe that our ability to increase the number of Paid Customers >$100,000 is a key indicator for important components of the growth of our business, including our success in expanding the number of users within a Paid Customer, providing the functionality required by large organizations and developing our direct sales force. In fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, approximately 49%, 46%, and 40%, respectively, of our revenue was generated from our Paid Customers >$100,000.\nWe define Paid Customers >$100,000 as those organizations on a paid subscription plan that had more than $100,000 in ARR as of a period end. ARR is based on monthly recurring revenue, or MRR, for the most recent month at period end, multiplied by twelve. For Paid Customers that have a type of subscription agreement where billing is reconciled on a monthly or quarterly basis based on usage, MRR is calculated by multiplying the monthly subscription price, inclusive of discounts, by the number of active subscriptions as of the month end. For Paid Customers that have a type of subscription agreement where billing is fixed and independent of usage, MRR is calculated by multiplying the monthly subscription price, inclusive of discounts, by the number of purchased subscriptions.\nNet Dollar Retention Rate\nWe disclose Net Dollar Retention Rate as a supplemental measure of our organic revenue growth. We believe Net Dollar Retention Rate is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain, and grow revenue from, our Paid Customers.\nWe calculate Net Dollar Retention Rate as of a period end by starting with the MRR from all Paid Customers as of twelve months prior to such period end, or Prior Period MRR. We then calculate the MRR from these same Paid Customers as of the current period end, or Current Period MRR. Current Period MRR includes expansion within Paid Customers and is net of contraction or attrition over the trailing twelve months, but excludes revenue from new Paid Customers in the current period, including those organizations that were only on Free subscription plans in the\nprior period and converted to paid subscription plans during the current period. We then divide the total Current Period MRR by the total Prior Period MRR to arrive at our Net Dollar Retention Rate. Our Net Dollar Retention Rate has declined from 143% as of January 31, 2019 to 132% as of January 31, 2020 to 123% as of January 31, 2021 as our base of revenue has grown the past few years and our penetration within existing, long-term Paid Customers has increased. Our Net Dollar Retention Rate will fluctuate in future periods due to a number of factors, including the growing level of our revenue base, the level of penetration within our Paid Customer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our Paid Customers.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the below non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use the below non-GAAP financial information, collectively, to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance, and assists in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP financial information to supplement their GAAP results. The non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In thousands)\nCalculated Billings $ 1,036,501 $ 765,263 $ 516,972\nFree Cash Flow $ 62,207 $ (62,015) $ (97,239)\nCalculated Billings\nCalculated Billings consists of our revenue plus the change in our deferred revenue in a given period. The Calculated Billings metric is intended to reflect sales to new paid customers plus renewals and additional sales to existing paid customers. Our management uses Calculated Billings to measure and monitor our sales growth because we generally bill our paid customers at the time of sale, but may recognize a portion of the related revenue ratably over time. For subscriptions, we typically invoice our paid customers at the beginning of the term, in annual or monthly installments and, from time to time, in multi-year installments. Only amounts invoiced to a paid customer in a given period are included in Calculated Billings. While we believe that Calculated Billings provides valuable insight into the cash that will be generated from sales of our subscriptions, this metric may vary from period-to-period for a number of reasons, and therefore has a number of limitations as a quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year comparative measure. These reasons include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) a variety of contractual terms could result in some periods having a higher proportion of annual subscriptions than other periods, (ii) as we focus on sales to large organizations, the lengthening of our sales cycle, and the variability in the timing of the execution of these larger transactions, (iii) fluctuations in payment terms affecting the billings recognized in a particular period, and (iv) seasonality in our billings, with a greater proportion of our billings occurring in our fourth quarter, following typical enterprise software buying patterns. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider Calculated Billings along with revenue and our other GAAP financial results.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of revenue, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Calculated Billings, for each of the periods presented:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In thousands)\nRevenue $ 902,610 $ 630,422 $ 400,552\nAdd: Total deferred revenue, end of year 510,605 376,714 241,873\nLess: Total deferred revenue, beginning of year (376,714) (241,873) (125,453)\nCalculated Billings $ 1,036,501 $ 765,263 $ 516,972\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We believe that Free Cash Flow is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our core operations that, after the purchases of property and equipment, can be used for strategic initiatives, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions, and strengthening our balance sheet. Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Some of the limitations of Free Cash Flow are that this metric does not reflect our future contractual commitments and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. We expect our Free Cash Flow to fluctuate in future periods as we invest in our business to support our plans for growth. These activities, along with certain increased operating expenses as described below, may result in a decrease in Free Cash Flow as a percentage of revenue in future periods.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented and provides a reconciliation of net cash from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Free Cash Flow for each of the periods presented:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 72,439 $ (12,389) $ (41,059)\nPurchases of property and equipment (10,232) (49,626) (56,180)\nFree Cash Flow $ 62,207 $ (62,015) $ (97,239)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (263,098) 330,128 $ (333,421)\nNet cash provided by financing activities $ 773,017 $ 18,490 $ 437,677\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue through sales of subscriptions of Slack to organizations. We recognize subscription revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract subscription period beginning on the date access to Slack is granted, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Our subscriptions are generally non-cancellable and typically do not contain general rights of return. We maintain a fair billing policy, under which certain organizations on a paid subscription plan are entitled to credit if they have not used the entirety of the contracted number of users for which they have paid during the contractual term of the arrangement. These credits, accounted for as a part of deferred revenue, may be carried over to offset future billings and are not refundable for cash. On occasion, we also provide professional services to organizations on Slack. Professional services revenue has not been material to date.\nOverhead Allocation and Employee Compensation Costs\nWe allocate shared costs, such as facilities (including rent, utilities, and depreciation on equipment shared by all departments) and information technology (IT) costs to all departments based on headcount. As such, allocated shared costs are reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category. Employee compensation costs, or personnel costs, include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation for cost of revenue and each operating expense category and also include sales commissions for sales and marketing.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists primarily of expenses related to hosting Slack and providing ongoing customer support for paid customers. These expenses include employee compensation (including stock-based compensation) and other employee-related expenses for customer experience, professional services, and technical operations staff, payments to outside service providers, third-party hosting costs, payment processing fees, and amortization expense associated with internally-developed and purchased technology. We expect our cost of revenue to continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts as we grow our business and revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and allocated overhead. Our research and development efforts focus on maintaining and enhancing existing functionality of, and adding new functionality to, Slack. We plan to increase the dollar amount of our investment in research and development for the foreseeable future as we focus on developing new features and enhancements. We expect, however, that our research and development expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time as our revenue grows, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in the timing and extent of our research and development expenses.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, expenses associated with our marketing and business development programs, including Frontiers, our annual user conference. Sales and marketing expenses also include allocated third-party hosting costs as well as customer experience and technical operations employee overhead costs for users of our free version of Slack. Sales commissions that are directly related to acquiring sales contracts, as well as associated payroll taxes, are deferred upon execution of a non-cancellable contract with an organization, and subsequently amortized to sales and marketing expense over the estimated period of benefit, typically four years. We plan to increase the dollar amount of our investment in sales and marketing for the foreseeable future, primarily for increased headcount for our direct sales organization and investment in brand and product marketing efforts. We expect to continue to incur sales and marketing expenses to the extent that we continue to see a high-growth market opportunity to support the growth of our business. If the growth in our business lessens over time, we plan to decrease the rate of growth in our sales and marketing expenses. We expect, however, that our sales and marketing expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time as our revenue grows, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our finance and accounting, legal, human resources, and other administrative teams as well as for certain executives and professional fees, including audit, legal, and recruiting services. We expect to increase the size of our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business. We also expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a U.S. securities exchange and costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and increased expenses in the areas of insurance, investor relations, and professional services. As a result, we expect the dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. We expect, however, that our general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenues over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in our revenue and the timing and extent of our general and administrative expenses.\nInterest Expense\nIn April 2020, we completed the private offering of the Notes, issuing $862.5 million aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due April 15, 2025. After our issuance of the Notes, interest expense consists primarily of contractual interest expense and amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs on the Notes.\nInterest Income and Other Income, Net\nInterest income and other income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, the change in fair value of our strategic investments, and gains or losses on foreign currency exchange.\nProvision for (benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of U.S. federal, state income taxes, and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Since inception, we have incurred operating losses and, accordingly, have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented other than provisions for foreign income tax. As of January 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for both federal and state income tax purposes of $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. We also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $110.4 million and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $81.5 million.\nSince the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $776.0 million as of January 31, 2021, against our net deferred tax asset balance of $779.9 million. If not utilized, a portion of the federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2029. Utilization of these net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation that is applicable if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d through a change in significant stockholder allocation or equity structure.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented in dollars and as a percentage of our revenue:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In thousands)\nRevenue\n$ 902,610 $ 630,422 $ 400,552\nCost of revenue(1)\n121,692 97,191 51,301\nGross profit\n780,918 533,231 349,251\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development(1)\n382,145 457,364 157,538\nSales and marketing(1)\n460,709 402,780 233,191\nGeneral and administrative(1)\n221,148 261,365 112,730\nTotal operating expenses\n1,064,002 1,121,509 503,459\nLoss from operations\n(283,084) (588,278) (154,208)\nInterest expense (38,105) (858) (434)\nInterest income and other income, net 28,386 21,368 16,580\nLoss before income taxes\n(292,803) (567,768) (138,062)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes (315) 589 840\nNet loss\n(292,488) (568,357) (138,902)\nNet income attributes to noncontrolling interest(2)\n7,934 2,701 1,781\nNet loss attributable to Slack\n$ (300,422) $ (571,058) $ (140,683)\n__________________\n(1)Includes stock-based compensation as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In thousands)\nCost of revenue $ 10,748 $ 16,013 $ 732\nResearch and development 115,047 226,507 9,948\nSales and marketing 58,705 98,797 2,677\nGeneral and administrative 42,863 85,207 9,775\nTotal stock-based compensation $ 227,363 $ 426,524 $ 23,132\n(2)Our consolidated financial statements include our majority-owned subsidiary, Slack Fund.

The increase in revenue was primarily due to expansion within our existing Paid Customers, as reflected by our Net Dollar Retention Rate of 123% as of January 31, 2021, and the addition of new Paid Customers, as our number of Paid Customers increased by 42% in the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. In addition, revenue generated from Paid Customers > $100,000 in the year ended January 31, 2021 increased to 49% compared to 46% in the year ended January 31, 2020.\nCost of revenue increased $24.5 million, or 25%, for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an $18.0 million increase in third-party hosting costs as the number of organizations on, and usage of, Slack in general increased, a $9.9 million increase in personnel costs related to increased headcount, and a $3.0 million increase in credit card payment processing fees as the volume of sales transactions increased. These increases were partially offset by a $6.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, as compared to the year ended January 31, 2020, when stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes were higher due primarily to the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021 2020 $ Change % change\n(In thousands)\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 382,145 $ 457,364 $ (75,219) (16) %\nSales and marketing 460,709 402,780 57,929 14\nGeneral and administrative 221,148 261,365 (40,217) (15)\nTotal operating expenses $ 1,064,002 $ 1,121,509 $ (57,507) (5)\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses decreased $75.2 million, or 16%, for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a $117.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, as compared to the year ended January 31, 2020, when stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes were higher due primarily to the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019, a $3.4 million decrease in travel costs due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, and a $3.1 million decrease in corporate expenses mainly related to local business taxes. This decrease was partially offset by a $47.5 million increase in personnel costs related to increased headcount.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased $57.9 million, or 14%, for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $66.3 million increase in personnel costs, which include customer experience and infrastructure employee costs for users of our free version, a $21.3 million increase in marketing expenses due to more spending on brand and advertising, a $14.5 million increase in third-party hosting costs for users on a Free subscription plan of Slack, primarily due to continuing growth in our user base, and a $4.7 million increase in facility- and IT-related overhead costs to support our headcount growth. This increase was partially offset by a $40.9 million decrease in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, as compared to the year ended January 31, 2020 when stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes were higher due primarily to the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019, and an $8.5 million decrease in travel costs due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $40.2 million, or 15%, for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a $44.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, as compared to the year ended January 31, 2020 when stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes were higher due primarily to the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019, a $30.4 million decrease in fees related to financial advisory services, audit, and legal expenses, which we incurred in connection with the Direct Listing, and a $5.5 million decrease in travel costs due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. This decrease was partially offset by a $24.7 million increase in legal fees and acquisition-related costs that include transaction expenses associated with the proposed merger with Salesforce of $8.7 million, and a $16.6 million increase in personnel costs related to increases in our administrative, finance and accounting, legal, IT, and human resources headcount.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $37.2 million for the year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the year ended January 31, 2020 due to contractual interest expense and amortization of the discount and issuance costs on the Notes issued in April 2020.\nInterest Income and Other Income, Net\nInterest income and other income, net was $28.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2021, an increase of $7.0 million from the year ended January 31, 2020. The increase in interest income and other income, net was primarily driven by a net increase in realized and unrealized gains from our strategic investments of $14.7 million, and an increase of net foreign exchange gains of $3.7 million, partially offset by a decrease of interest income of $10.4 million due primarily to a decrease in interest rates.\nProvision for (benefit from) Income Taxes\nThe benefit from income taxes was $0.3 million for the year ended January 31, 2021, compared to the provision for income taxes of $0.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2020, primarily related to the tax benefit resulting from stock-based compensation in our foreign jurisdictions.\nComparison of the Years Ended January 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenue and Cost of Revenue\nYear Ended January 31,\n2020 2019 $ Change % change\n(In thousands)\nRevenue $ 630,422 $ 400,552 $ 229,870 57 %\nCost of revenue 97,191 51,301 45,890 89\nGross profit $ 533,231 $ 349,251 $ 183,980 53\nRevenue increased $229.9 million, or 57%, for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase in revenue was primarily due to expansion within our existing Paid Customers, as reflected by our Net Dollar Retention Rate of 132% as of January 31, 2020, and the addition of new Paid Customers, as our number of Paid Customers increased by 25% in the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. In addition, revenue generated from Paid Customers > $100,000 in the year ended January 31, 2020 increased to 46% compared to 40% in the year ended January 31, 2019.\nCost of revenue increased $45.9 million, or 89%, for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $16.4 million increase in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, driven by the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019. The increase was also driven by a $12.4 million increase in third-party hosting costs as the number of organizations on, and usage of, Slack in general increased, an $8.8 million increase in personnel costs related to increased headcount, and a $3.9 million increase in facility- and IT-related overhead costs to support our headcount growth and the continued development and scalability of Slack.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended January 31,\n2020 2019 $ Change % change\n(In thousands)\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development $ 457,364 $ 157,538 $ 299,826 190 %\nSales and marketing 402,780 233,191 169,589 73\nGeneral and administrative 261,365 112,730 148,635 132\nTotal operating expenses $ 1,121,509 $ 503,459 $ 618,050 123\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses increased $299.8 million, or 190%, for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $231.1 million increase in stock-\nbased compensation and related employer payroll taxes, driven by the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019. The increase was also driven by a $50.0 million increase in personnel costs related to increased headcount, and a $10.7 million increase in facility- and IT-related overhead costs to support our headcount growth and the continued development and scalability of Slack.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses increased $169.6 million, or 73%, for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $101.8 million increase in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, driven by the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019. Personnel costs, which include customer experience and infrastructure employee costs for users of our free version, increased by $47.7 million related to increased sales and marketing headcount to support our growth. The increase was also driven by a $16.2 million increase in facility- and IT-related overhead costs to support our headcount growth, a $9.9 million increase in third-party hosting costs for users on a Free subscription plan of Slack due to continuing growth in our user base, and a $6.7 million increase in travel related costs due to increased sales activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in marketing expenses of $14.4 million due primarily to reduced spending on advertising by $23.6 million, partially offset by increased public relations, marketing content, and business development programs of $8.7 million, including Frontiers, our annual user conference.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $148.6 million, or 132%, for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an $80.9 million increase in stock-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, driven by the satisfaction of the performance vesting condition on outstanding RSUs in connection with the Direct Listing in June 2019. The increase was also driven by one-time fees of $30.4 million related to financial advisory services, audit, and legal expenses in connection with the Direct Listing, a $23.7 million increase in personnel costs related to increases in our administrative, finance and accounting, legal, IT, and human resources headcount, and a $4.3 million increase in facility- and IT-related overhead costs due to additional headcount.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $0.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2020 compared to the year ended January 31, 2019 due primarily to the fees related to the revolving credit facility.\nInterest Income and Other Income, Net\nInterest income and other income, net $21.4 million for the year ended January 31, 2020, an increase of $4.8 million from the year ended January 31, 2019. The increase in interest income and other income, net was primarily due to an increase in interest income of $3.2 million due to overall increase in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and a net increase in realized and unrealized gains from our strategic investments of $1.9 million, partially offset by a decrease of net foreign exchange gains of $1.3 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $0.6 million for the year ended January 31, 2020, a decrease of $0.3 million from the year ended January 31, 2019, primarily related to the tax benefit resulting from stock-based compensation in our foreign jurisdictions.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended January 31, 2021, as well as the percentage of revenue that each line item represents for each quarter.

We have typically experienced larger billings in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, though this seasonality is sometimes not immediately apparent in our revenue due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the contract.\nTotal cost of revenue increased sequentially for all periods presented, excluding the impact from stock-based compensation, primarily due to increases in personnel costs and third-party hosting costs necessary to support our growth in revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased sequentially for all periods presented, excluding the impact from the Direct Listing related fees and stock-based compensation, primarily due to increases in employee headcount and the expansion of our business.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion and marketable securities of $505.9 million. Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of bank deposits, money market funds, certificates of deposit, and U.S. government securities. Restricted cash consists of cash deposited with financial institutions as collateral for our obligations under the facility leases in San Francisco, California and Denver, Colorado. As of January 31, 2021, our restricted cash totaled $38.5 million. Marketable securities are comprised of certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, U.S. government securities, and corporate bonds. As of January 31, 2021, 95% of all cash and cash equivalents are held in the United States. Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the issuance of our convertible preferred stock, the Notes, common stock, and cash generated from the sale of our subscriptions.\nWe have generated significant losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities in the past as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $1.5 billion as of January 31, 2021. We expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the investments that we intend to make in our business and, as a result, we may require additional capital resources to grow our business.\nIn May 2019, we entered into a $215.0 million revolving credit and guaranty agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions. The revolving credit facility has an accordion option, which, if exercised, would allow us to increase the aggregate commitments by up to the greater of $200.0 million and 100% of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA of us and our subsidiaries, plus an unlimited amount subject to satisfaction of certain leverage ratio based compliance tests after giving effect to the exercise, in each case subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain conditions. Pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility, we may issue letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, which reduce the total amount available for borrowing under such facility. The revolving credit facility terminates on May 30, 2024. As of January 31, 2021, we had no amounts or letters of credit issued and outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Our total available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was $215.0 million as of January 31, 2021.\nIn April 2020, we completed our private offering of the Notes and received aggregate proceeds of $862.5 million, before deducting issuance costs of $21.2 million. In connection with the Notes, we also entered into the Capped Calls with respect to our Class A common stock. We used an aggregate amount of $105.6 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to purchase the Capped Calls.\nWe believe that current cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements, however, will depend on many factors, including our subscription growth rate, our Net Dollar Retention Rate, the timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and features, particularly for large organizations and for networks between organizations and the continuing market adoption of Slack. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may seek to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked arrangements, and debt. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired and at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. See the section titled \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Industry-Our failure to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies and customer acquisition efforts in the future could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations.\u201d\nOn December 1, 2020 we entered into the Merger Agreement with Salesforce. We have agreed to various covenants and agreements, including, among others, agreements to conduct our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Mergers. Outside of certain limited exceptions, we may not take, authorize, commit, resolve, or agree to do certain actions without Salesforce\u2019s consent, including:\n\u2022acquiring businesses and disposing of significant assets;\n\u2022incurring expenditures above specified thresholds;\n\u2022issuing additional debt facilities; and\n\u2022repurchasing shares of our outstanding common stock.\nWe do not believe these restrictions will prevent us from meeting our ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs, or capital expenditure requirements.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2021 2020 2019\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 72,439 $ (12,389) $ (41,059)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities (263,098) 330,128 (333,421)\nNet cash provided by financing activities 773,017 18,490 437,677\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 582,358 $ 336,229 $ 63,197\nCash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is cash collections from organizations on a paid subscription plan. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, sales and marketing expenses, and third-party hosting costs. Historically, we have generated negative cash flows from operating activities and have supplemented working capital requirements through net proceeds from the private sale of equity securities.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2021, operating activities provided $72.4 million in cash. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $292.5 million, impacted by $323.1 million of non-cash charges and $41.8 million of cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of $227.4 million in stock-based compensation, $37.6 million of non-cash lease expenses, $33.7 million of amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, $28.8 million of depreciation and amortization, and $15.8 million of amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, partially offset by a $20.3 million gain as a result of the change in fair value of our strategic investments, and a $2.2 million gain from net amortization of bond discounts on debt securities available for sale. The cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $132.9 million increase in deferred revenue due to additional billings with new and existing paid customers, a $43.7 million increase in accrued compensation and benefits, and a $3.2 million increase other liabilities. These amounts were partially offset by a $92.4 million increase in accounts receivable reflecting increased billings, $25.6 million of operating lease payments, a $16.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets mainly due to an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs, and a $3.4 million decrease in accounts payable.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2020, operating activities used $12.4 million in cash. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $568.4 million, impacted by $462.8 million of non-cash charges and $93.2 million of cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of $426.5 million in stock-based compensation, $27.1 million of depreciation and amortization, $9.0 million of non-cash lease expenses, and $8.2 million of amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, partially offset by a $5.6 million gain as a result of the change in fair value of our strategic investments, and a $2.2 million gain from net amortization of bond discounts on debt securities available for sale. The cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $134.8 million increase in deferred revenue due to additional billings with new and existing paid customers and a $46.6 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses including compensation and benefits, and accrued expenses and other liabilities as a result of our increased spending and headcount associated with the growth of our business. These amounts were partially offset by a $58.2 million increase in accounts receivable reflecting increased billings, a $20.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets mainly due to an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs, and $9.5 million of operating lease payments\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2019, operating activities used $41.1 million in cash. The primary factors affecting our operating cash flows during this period were our net loss of $138.9 million, impacted by $39.2 million non-cash charges and $58.7 million of cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of $23.1 million in stock-based compensation, $16.8 million of depreciation and amortization, $3.2 million of amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs, and a $2.3 million loss on disposal\nof property and equipment, partially offset by a $3.7 million gain as a result of the change in fair value of our strategic investments and a $3.1 million gain from net amortization of bond discount on debt securities available for sale. The cash provided from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $116.4 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased billings, and a $45.6 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses including compensation and benefits, and other liabilities as a result of our increased spending and headcount associated with the growth of our business. These amounts were partially offset by a $53.1 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets mainly due to a $22.8 million increase in prepaid hosting services and a $12.7 million increase in deferred contract acquisition costs, and a $50.3 million increase in accounts receivable, reflecting increased billings.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2021 was $263.1 million, which was primarily driven by purchases of marketable securities of $561.2 million, strategic investments of $20.0 million, property and equipment of $10.2 million, an acquisition of intangible assets of $2.4 million, partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities of $322.9 million and net cash acquired from a business combination of $6.6 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2020 was $330.1 million, which was primarily driven by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $683.7 million, partially offset by cash used to purchase marketable securities of $290.2 million, property and equipment of $49.6 million, and strategic investments of $14.1 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities during the year ended January 31, 2019 was $333.4 million, which was primarily used to purchase marketable securities of $967.1 million, property and equipment of $56.2 million, business and intangible assets of $47.7 million, and strategic investments of $2.3 million, partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $738.9 million.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended January 31, 2021 was $773.0 million, primarily driven by proceeds from the issuance of the Notes of $841.3 million, net of issuance costs, proceeds from employee purchases of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan of $29.8 million, and the exercise of stock options of $13.1 million, partially offset by a payment for Capped Calls related to the Notes of $105.6 million and payments of contingent consideration for acquisitions of $5.3 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended January 31, 2020 was $18.5 million, primarily driven by the exercise of stock options to purchase common stock of $14.2 million, proceeds from employee purchases of common stock under the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP, of $7.4 million, and capital contributions from noncontrolling interest holders of $3.8 million, partially offset by a payment of contingent consideration for an acquisition of $5.0 million and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders of $1.4 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended January 31, 2019 was $437.7 million, reflecting proceeds from issuance of convertible preferred stock of $426.9 million, proceeds from issuance of common stock to a third party of $6.1 million, and the exercise of stock options to purchase common stock of $4.8 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal contractual commitments primarily consist of the convertible senior notes and obligations under leases for office space and datacenter operations.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of January 31, 2021, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table:\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal Less than\n1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than\n5 years\n(In thousands)\nConvertible senior notes(1)\n$ 881,727 $ 4,313 $ 8,625 $ 868,789 $ -\nOperating lease obligations(2)\n458,808 34,943 102,944 107,212 213,709\nHosting commitments(3)\n329,987 63,737 172,500 93,750 -\nOther commitments(4)\n26,340 10,501 4,805 3,878 7,156\nTotal $ 1,696,862 $ 113,494 $ 288,874 $ 1,073,629 $ 220,865\n__________________\n(1)Consists of principal and interest payments. The $862.5 million in principal is due April 2025. For more information regarding the Notes, refer to Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(2)Consists of future non-cancelable minimum lease payments under operating leases for our offices.\n(3)In April 2020, we executed an amendment to our existing agreement with Amazon Web Services. The amended agreement was effective as of May 1, 2020 and continues through April 30, 2025. We have minimum annual commitments of $75.0 million which will increase by $5.0 million annually, for a total minimum commitment of $425.0 million.\n(4)Consists of future minimum payments under non-cancelable purchase commitments primarily related to IT operations, sales activities and acquisition related obligations.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations set forth above, as of January 31, 2021, we had $38.5 million in standby letters of credit outstanding related to our office facilities in San Francisco, California and Denver, Colorado.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of January 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from contracts with organizations on a paid subscription plan using the five-step method described in Note 1 in our consolidated financial statements. We derive substantially all revenue from monthly, annual, and multi-year subscription fees earned from organizations on a paid subscription plan accessing Slack.\nIn our contracts, we typically have one performance obligation of providing access to Slack. On occasion, we also provide professional services to organizations on Slack, which are separate performance obligations. Professional services revenue has not been material to date.\nIn general, we satisfy our performance obligations over time as we provide the promised services to organizations on a paid subscription plan. We maintain a fair billing policy, under which certain organizations on a\npaid subscription plan are entitled to credit if they have not used the entirety of the contracted number of users for which they have paid during the contractual term of the arrangement. These credits, accounted for as a part of deferred revenue, may be carried over to offset future billings and are not refundable for cash. A majority of our contracts give a right to bill for additional usage, and this is deemed variable consideration. The variable consideration is allocated to the distinct day the services are completed, as services provided to the additional users are specific to the period that the usage occurs. To the extent that we believe it is probable that a significant reversal would not occur, an estimate is made for the revenue associated with incremental usage during a period. The incremental revenue recognized associated with these estimates has not been material through fiscal year 2021.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nThe Notes are accounted for in accordance with the FASB, issued Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Pursuant to ASC Subtopic 470-20, issuers of certain convertible debt instruments, such as the Notes, that have a net settlement feature and may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion are required to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument. The carrying amount of the liability component of the instrument is computed by estimating the fair value of a similar liability without the conversion option using a market-based approach. The amount of the equity component is then calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the instrument. The difference between the principal amount and the liability component represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Notes using an effective interest rate method. The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes, the allocation of issuance costs incurred between the liability and equity components was based on their relative values.\nDeferred Contract Acquisition Costs\nSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. As a result, sales commissions for new revenue contracts, including incremental sales to existing customers, are deferred and then amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of benefit, which we have determined to be generally four years. The period of benefit has been determined by considering factors such as historical customer attrition rates, the useful life of our technology, and the impact of competition in our industry as well as other factors.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards, including stock options, RSUs, restricted stock awards, or RSAs, restricted stock, and purchase rights issued under the ESPP granted to employees, directors, and other service providers, based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option and purchase rights issued under the ESPP granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, except for the RSUs granted under our 2009 Stock Plan, or the 2009 Plan.\nUnder the 2009 Plan, we granted RSUs to our employees, directors and service providers with both a service-based vesting condition and a performance-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting period for these awards was typically four years with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly thereafter. The fair value of RSUs was estimated based on the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant. On June 20, 2019, the performance vesting condition was satisfied upon the completion of the Direct Listing and as a result, we recorded cumulative stock-based compensation of $245.1 million related to all then-outstanding RSUs granted under the 2009 Plan. We recognize stock compensation associated with the RSUs granted under the 2009 Plan using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period.\nUnder the 2019 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, or the 2019 Plan, we grant RSUs to employees, directors and service providers with a service-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting period for these awards is typically four years with a cliff vesting period of one year and continued vesting quarterly thereafter.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee the section titled \u201cDescription of Business and Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.",

To that end, during the past year, our management periodically reviewed our corporate governance policies and practices to ensure that they remain consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, SEC rules, and NYSE listing standards.\nBesides verifying the independence of the members of our board of directors and committees (which is discussed in the section titled \u201cIndependence of Our Board \u201d under Item 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), at the direction of our board of directors, we also:\n\u2022Periodically review and make necessary changes to the charters for our audit and risk, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees;\n\u2022Have established disclosures control policies and procedures in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC;\n\u2022Have a procedure for receipt and treatment of anonymous and confidential complaints or concerns regarding audit or accounting matters in place; and\n\u2022Have a code of conduct that applies to our employees, officers, and directors, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other executive and senior financial officers.\nIn addition, we have adopted a set of corporate governance guidelines. Our nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for reviewing our corporate governance guidelines from time to time and reporting and making recommendations to our board of directors concerning corporate governance matters. A copy of our corporate governance guidelines can be found on our investor relations website at investor.slackhq.com. Our corporate governance guidelines address such matters as:\n\u2022Director Independence - Independent directors must constitute at least a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022Monitoring Board of Directors Effectiveness - Our board of directors must conduct an annual self-evaluation of our board and its committees;\n\u2022Board of Directors Access to Independent Advisors - Our board of directors as a whole, and each of its committees separately, have authority to retain independent experts, advisors, or professionals as each deems necessary or appropriate; and\n\u2022Board Committees - All members of the audit and risk, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees are independent in accordance with applicable NYSE criteria.\nCode of Conduct\nOur board of directors has adopted a code of conduct that applies to all of our employees, officers, and directors, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other executive and senior financial officers. The full text of our code of conduct is available on our investor relations website at investor.slackhq.com under \u201cGovernance.\u201d We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding amendments to, or waiver from, a provision of our code of conduct by posting such information on the website address and location specified above. During fiscal year 2021, no such waivers were granted from any provision of the code of conduct.\nBoard of Directors Leadership Structure\nStewart Butterfield, our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, serves as Chairperson of our board of directors, presides over meetings of our board of directors, and holds such other powers and carries out such other duties as are customarily carried out by the Chairperson of our board of directors. Mr. Butterfield brings valuable insight to our board of directors due to the perspective and experience he has as our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer.\nOur board of directors has appointed John O\u2019Farrell to serve as our lead independent director. As lead independent director, Mr. O\u2019Farrell presides over periodic meetings of our independent directors, serves as a liaison between the Chairperson of our board of directors and the independent directors, and performs such additional duties as our board of directors may otherwise determine and delegate.\nCommittees of Our Board of Directors\nOur board of directors has established an audit and risk committee, a compensation committee, and a nominating and corporate governance committee. The composition and responsibilities of each of the committees of our board of directors is described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or until as otherwise determined by our board of directors. Each of the audit and risk, compensation, and nominating and\ncorporate governance committees operates pursuant to a separate written charter adopted by our board of directors that is available to stockholders at investor.slackhq.com under \u201cGovernance.\u201d\nAudit and Risk Committee\nOur audit and risk committee consists of Mr. Smith and Mses. Friar and Jordan, with Mr. Smith serving as Chairperson. Our audit and risk committee, among other things:\n\u2022selects and hires a qualified firm to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements;\n\u2022supervises and evaluates the independent registered public accounting firm;\n\u2022evaluates the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm;\n\u2022discusses the scope and results of the audit with the independent registered public accounting firm, and reviews, with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, our interim and year-end results of operations;\n\u2022approves audited financial information and the audit and risk committee report;\n\u2022oversees procedures for employees to submit concerns anonymously about questionable accounting or audit matters;\n\u2022reviews major financial risk exposures, information security risk, and cybersecurity risk;\n\u2022reviews related party transactions;\n\u2022obtains and reviews a report by the independent registered public accounting firm at least annually, that describes our internal control procedures, any material issues with such procedures and any steps taken to deal with such issues;\n\u2022reviews disclosure controls and procedures; and\n\u2022approves (or, as permitted, pre-approves) all audit and all permissible non-audit services and fees, to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm.\nOur audit and risk committee annually reviews the independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s independence, including reviewing all relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and us and any disclosed relationships or services that may impact the objectivity and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm, and the independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s performance.\nCompensation Committee\nOur compensation committee consists of Messrs. Braccia and McNamara and Ms. Cooper, with Ms. Cooper serving as Chairperson. The purpose of our compensation committee is to discharge the responsibilities of our board of directors relating to compensation of our executive officers. Our compensation committee, among other things:\n\u2022reviews, approves, and determines, or makes recommendations to our board of directors regarding, the compensation of our executive officers;\n\u2022administers our stock and equity incentive plans;\n\u2022reviews and approves, or make recommendations to our board of directors regarding, incentive compensation and equity plans; and\n\u2022establishes and reviews general policies relating to the compensation and benefits offered to our employees.\nOur compensation committee operates under a written charter that satisfies the applicable rules of the SEC and the NYSE listing standards.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee\nOur nominating and corporate governance committee consists of Messrs. McNamara and Smith and Ms. Cooper, with Ms. Cooper serving as Chairperson.

Braccia and McNamara and Ms. Cooper served as members of the compensation committee. None of the members of our compensation committee is or has been an officer or employee of our Company or has had any other relationship requiring disclosure herein. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors or compensation committee. See the section titled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\u201d for information about related party transactions involving members of our compensation committee or their affiliates.\nStockholder Recommendations\nNo material changes have been made to the procedures by which our stockholders may recommend nominees to our board of directors since the procedures described in our proxy statement for our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders filed with the SEC on May 5, 2020.\nNon-Employee Director Compensation\nNon-Employee Director Compensation Policy\nWe believe that a combination of cash and equity compensation is appropriate to attract and retain the individuals we desire to serve on our board of directors and that this approach is comparable to the policies of our peers. We further believe that it is appropriate to provide cash compensation to our non-employee directors to compensate them for their time and effort and to provide equity compensation to our non-employee directors to align their long-term interests with those of the Company and our stockholders.\nIn June 2019, we adopted our Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy (as amended and restated from time to time, the Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy) for the compensation of our non-employee directors. Our compensation committee conducts an annual evaluation of the design and competitiveness of our Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy in light of best practices, market trends and a competitive market analysis of data for the Company\u2019s compensation peer group prepared by the compensation committee\u2019s\ncompensation consultant and makes appropriate recommendations to our board of directors with respect to the compensation of our non-employee directors.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, our compensation committee reviewed and considered a peer group compensation data analysis prepared by Compensia. Our compensation committee did not strictly target any specific levels of pay, and instead, used the comparative market analysis provided by Compensia as a reference point in its decision-making process. In August 2020, after reviewing the comparative market analysis in consultation with Compensia, our compensation committee recommended increasing the Annual Grant (as defined below) from $180,000 to 200,000.\nPursuant to our Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy, our non-employee directors receive the following annual cash retainers for their service:\nAnnual Retainer for Board Membership\nAnnual service on the board of directors $ 35,000\nAnnual service on the board of directors as lead independent director $ 20,000\nAdditional Annual Retainer for Committee Membership\nAnnual service as member of the audit and risk committee (other than chair) $ 10,000\nAnnual service as chair of the audit and risk committee $ 20,000\nAnnual service as member of the compensation committee (other than chair) $ 7,500\nAnnual service as chair of the compensation committee $ 15,000\nAnnual service as member of the nominating and corporate governance committee (other than chair) $ 4,000\nAnnual service as chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee $ 8,000\nOur Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy provides that upon initial election to our board of directors, a new non-employee director will be granted RSUs for our Class A common stock having a fair market value of $300,000, or the Initial Grant. In addition, on the date of each of our annual meetings of stockholders, each non-employee director who will continue as a non-employee director following such meeting will be granted an annual award of RSUs for our Class A common stock having a fair market value of $200,000, or the Annual Grant. The Initial Grant will vest in three equal annual installments on each anniversary of the non-employee director\u2019s appointment to our board of directors, subject to continued service as a director through each applicable vesting date. The Annual Grant will vest in full on the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the grant date or (ii) our next annual meeting of stockholders, subject to continued service as a director through the applicable vesting date. In addition, all such awards are subject to full accelerated vesting upon the sale event of our Company (as defined in the policy).\nEmployee directors receive no additional compensation for their service as a director.\nWe reimburse all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by non-employee directors for their attendance at meetings of our board of directors or any committee thereof.\nFiscal Year 2021 Non-Employee Director Compensation Table\nThe following table presents the total compensation for each person who served as a non-employee director during fiscal year 2021. Other than as set forth in the table below, we did not pay any compensation or make any equity awards to our non-employee directors during fiscal year 2021. During fiscal year 2021, Mr. Butterfield, our Chief Executive Officer, was a member of our board of directors, as well as an employee, and received no additional\ncompensation for his services as a director. The compensation received by Mr. Butterfield as Chief Executive Officer of the Company is presented in \u201cExecutive Compensation-Summary Compensation Table\u201d below.\nName Fees Earned or Paid In\nCash ($)(1)\nStock Awards ($)(2)\nTotal ($)\nAndrew Braccia(3)\n42,500 193,943 236,443\nEdith Cooper(4)\n58,000 193,943 251,943\nSarah Friar(5)\n45,000 193,943 238,943\nSheila B.

Our annual cash retainers are paid quarterly.\n(2)The amounts reported represent the grant date fair value of the RSUs granted during fiscal year 2021 under our 2019 Plan, as computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Such grant value does not take into account any estimated forfeitures. The assumptions used in calculating the grant date fair value are set forth in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The amounts reported in this column reflect the accounting cost for these awards and does not correspond to the actual economic value that may be received by the director upon vesting, settlement, or sale of any of the underlying shares of our Class A common stock.\n(3)As of January 31, 2021, Mr. Braccia held 5,854 RSUs for our Class A common stock.\n(4)As of January 31, 2021, Ms. Cooper held 5,854 RSUs for our Class A common stock and 68,357 RSUs for our Class B common stock.\n(5)As of January 31, 2021, Ms. Friar held (i) 5,854 RSUs for our Class A common stock and (ii) 25,377 restricted shares of our Class B common stock that are subject to risk of forfeiture through the David Riley and Sarah Friar Revocable Trust dated August 11, 2006.\n(6)As of January 31, 2021, Ms. Jordan held 12,398 RSUs for our Class A common stock.\n(7)As of January 31, 2021, Mr. McNamara held 15,148 RSUs for our Class A common stock.\n(8)As of January 31, 2021, Mr. O\u2019Farrell held 5,854 RSUs for our Class A common stock.\n(9)As of January 31, 2021, Mr. Smith held (i) 5,854 RSUs for our Class A common stock and (ii) 105,000 restricted shares of our Class B common stock that are subject to risk of forfeiture.\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock to file with the SEC initial reports of beneficial ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership. Officers, directors, and stockholders who own more than 10% of our Class A common stock are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all such reports.\nTo our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required, we believe that for fiscal year 2021 all required reports were filed on a timely basis under Section 16(a), other than one report of two contemporaneous transactions for the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock by Allen Shim that was filed late due to an inadvertent administrative error."

In this report, sometimes we use the terms \u201cCompany\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cours\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cRegistrant\u201d and similar words to refer to Intelligent Systems Corporation and subsidiaries. Our executive offices are located at 4355 Shackleford Road, Norcross, Georgia 30093 and our telephone number is (770) 381-2900. Our website address is www.intelsys.com. We publish our Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) reports on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file them with or furnish them to the SEC, and shareholders may access and download these reports free of charge.\nWe are primarily engaged in the business of providing technology solutions and processing services to the financial technology and services market, commonly referred to as the FinTech industry. Our FinTech operations are conducted through our wholly owned CoreCard Software, Inc. (\u201cCoreCard\u201d) subsidiary and its affiliate companies in Romania, India and Dubai, as well as the corporate office which provides significant administrative, human resources and executive management support to CoreCard. Corecard\u2019s affiliate companies are CoreCard SRL in Romania, ISC Software in India and Corecard Software DMCC in Dubai, that perform software development and testing as well as processing operations support for CoreCard.\nFor further information about trends and risks likely to impact our business, please refer to Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nCoreCard Software, Inc. - We conduct our business primarily through CoreCard. CoreCard SRL in Romania, ISC Software in India and Corecard Software DMCC in Dubai perform software development, software testing, business analysis, operations and support for CoreCard but have not sold products or services directly to third parties to date. Accordingly, this discussion describes the CoreCard business involving the four entities as a single business unit. CoreCard designs, develops and markets a comprehensive suite of software solutions to program managers, accounts receivable businesses, financial institutions, retailers and processors to manage their credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, private label cards, fleet cards, loyalty programs and accounts receivable and loan transactions. CoreCard utilizes the same core software solution in its processing operations as it sells to licensees, although licensees typically request a variety of customizations which may or may not deviate from the core software solution offering.\nThe CoreCard software solutions allow companies to offer various types of debit and credit cards as well as installment and revolving loans, to set up and maintain account data, to record advances and payments, to assess fees, interest and other charges, to resolve disputes and chargebacks, to manage collections of accounts receivable, to generate reports and to settle transactions with financial institutions and network associations.\nThe CoreCard proprietary software applications are based on CoreCard\u2019s core financial transaction processing platform (CoreENGINE\u2122) and address the unique requirements of customers and program managers that issue or process:\n\u25cf\nCredit Cards/Loans - revolving or non-revolving credit issued to consumer or business accounts (with or without a physical card) that typically involve interest, fees, settlement, collections, etc. Within this market, CoreCard offers software specifically tailored to handle private label cards, network branded (i.e., MasterCard, VISA or Discover) bank cards, fleet cards, loans of any type, or any other type of \u201csystem of record\u201d accounts receivable.\n\u25cf\nPrepaid/Debit Cards - pre-loaded funds drawn down for purchase or cash withdrawal typically involving a variety of fees but no interest. Numerous examples exist including gift cards, loyalty/reward cards, health benefit cards, payroll and benefits disbursement, student aid disbursement, government assistance payments, corporate expense cards, transit cards and any other type of \u201csystem of record\u201d stored value accounts.\nThe CoreCard software solutions allow customers to optimize their card account management systems, improve customer retention, lower operating costs and create greater market differentiation. The CoreCard solutions are feature-rich, have web interfaces including a standard library of APIs and contain financial transaction processing solutions that allow customers to automate, streamline and optimize business processes associated with the set-up, administration, management and settlement of credit, prepaid and loan accounts, to process transactions, and to generate reports and statements for these accounts. In addition, because the CoreCard products are designed to run on lower cost, scalable PC-based servers, rather than expensive legacy mainframe computers, customers may benefit from lower overall costs since the solution provides scalability by adding additional servers as card volume grows. The CoreCard product functionality includes embedded multi-lingual, multi-currency support, web-based interface, real-time processing, complex rules-based authorizations, account hierarchies, documented APIs for easy integration to the backend functionality and robust fee libraries. These features support customer-defined pricing and payment terms and allow CoreCard\u2019s customers to create new and innovative card programs to differentiate themselves in the marketplace and improve customer retention.\nWe believe CoreCard is unique among software companies because it offers a full array of card and account management software solutions, available either for in-house license or outsourced processing by CoreCard\u2019s processing business (\u201cProcessing Services\u201d) at the customer\u2019s option. CoreCard also provides customers with a unique option to license the same CoreCard software that is used in the CoreCard processing environment and transfer it in-house for customer-controlled processing at a later date.\n\u25cf\nLicense - CoreCard sells a software license to a customer who then runs the CoreCard software system, configured for the customer\u2019s unique requirements, at a customer controlled location. It usually requires substantial additional resources from CoreCard to customize or operate the licensed software. CoreCard is de-emphasizing the license option.\n\u25cf\nProcessing Services - CoreCard offers processing services that allow customers to outsource their card processing requirements to CoreCard. CoreCard manages all aspects of the processing functions using its proprietary software configured for each processing customer.\nWe continue to add resources to expand upon our infrastructure investment to support CoreCard\u2019s Processing Services line of business. CoreCard processes prepaid cards and credit cards (private label and open loop/network) for a number of customers and anticipates steadily growing this business further in 2021. CoreCard has multiple secure processing data centers at third party locations, is certified as compliant with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards and has an SSAE-18 SOC 1 and SOC 2 independent audit report that can be relied on by its prepaid and credit processing customers. It has obtained certification from Discover, MasterCard, Visa, Star and Pulse.\nCoreCard added a significant new license customer in 2018, which represented 69% and 60% of our consolidated revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect future professional services, maintenance, and license revenue from this customer in 2021 and future years, however the amount and timing will be dependent on various factors not in our control such as the number of accounts on file and the level of customization needed by the customer.\nCoreCard has relationships with several financial institutions that are important for network certification, referrals for processing or program managers, and sponsoring prospective card programs.\nCoreCard has Program Manager capabilities in addition to processing services, which has allowed us to gain additional experience adding the potential for increased revenue, although we do not expect any significant revenue impact as a Program Manager near term.\nCoreCard\u2019s principal target markets include consumer revolving credit portfolios, accounts receivable businesses, prepaid card issuers, retail and private-label issuers (large and small), small third-party processors, and small, mid-size and large financial institutions in the United States. CoreCard has customers in international markets as well. CoreCard competes with third-party card processors that allow customers to outsource their account transaction processing rather than acquire software to manage their transactions in-house. CoreCard competes with several larger and more established software processors. Many of CoreCard\u2019s competitors, especially certain processors, have significantly more financial, marketing and development resources than does CoreCard and have large, established customer bases often tied to long-term contracts. CoreCard believes it can compete successfully in its selected markets by providing to its licensed software customers and processing customers a robust technology platform, lower overall cost per account fees, greater system flexibility, and more customer-driven marketing options. Additionally, the size and flexibility of CoreCard makes it possible to get to market more quickly with customized, flexible programs. Under our Processing Services option, customers can contract with CoreCard to provide processing services for their accounts using CoreCard software configured to the customer\u2019s preferences, with an option to license the same software and bring it in-house when and if the customer decides to become its own processor in the future. We believe this transition path for customers is unique in the industry.\nThe CoreCard software platform and modules include CoreENGINE\u2122, CoreISSUE\u2122, CoreFraud\u2122, CoreCOLLECT\u2122, CoreAPP\u2122, CoreMONEY\u2122 and CoreAcquire\u2122. Using a proprietary, base transaction processing platform called CoreENGINE, the CoreCard application modules have been further enhanced to meet the specific requirements of different market segments; for instance, CoreISSUE\u2122 is available in different versions tailored to the requirements for issuing prepaid cards, fleet cards, bank cards or private label cards/accounts as well as accounts receivable management. In addition, CoreCard configures and/or customizes its robust base modules with additional or specific functionality to meet each customer\u2019s requirements. The Company has developed and licensed such products to customers in the prepaid, fleet, private label, retail and credit markets. As is typical of most software companies, CoreCard expects to continually enhance and upgrade its existing software solutions and to develop additional modules to meet changing customer and market requirements. To date, CoreCard has focused its extensive development and limited sales activities on building a base of customers in each of its target markets, as well as putting in place the infrastructure and processes to be able to scale the business successfully, particularly for the Processing Services business.\nHistorically, most of the Company\u2019s sales have resulted from prospects contacting CoreCard based on an online search. CoreCard typically sells its products directly to customers, often in competitive situations, with relatively long sales and implementation cycles.\nWe have several revenue streams. We receive software license fees that vary depending upon the number of licensed users, number of accounts on the system, and the number of software modules licensed. We also derive service revenue from implementation, customization, and annual maintenance and support contracts for our licensed software. Processing customers pay an implementation and setup fee plus monthly service fees, primarily based on number of accounts, under a contract with a term of generally three or more years. Depending on factors such as contract terms, customer implementation and testing schedule, and extent of customization or configuration required and whether we are licensing or processing, the timing of revenue recognition on contracts may lead to considerable fluctuation in revenue and profitability. There are often delays in implementation cycles, especially for processing customers, due to third party approvals or processes that are outside of CoreCard\u2019s control and thus it is not possible to predict with certainty when we will be able to begin recognizing revenue on new contracts.\nCoreCard\u2019s licensed software products are used by its customers to manage and process various credit, debit and prepaid card programs and there are a number of federal and state regulations governing the issuance of and the processing of financial transactions associated with such cards. CoreCard\u2019s customers are required to comply with such regulations and, to the extent that customers depend on their licensed CoreCard software to manage and process their card accounts, the CoreCard software features and functionality must allow customers to comply with the various governmental regulations. CoreCard continually evaluates applicable regulations and regularly upgrades and enhances its software to help its customers meet their obligations to comply with current and anticipated governmental regulations. As part of CoreCard\u2019s processing business, CoreCard provides compliance-related services, including data and network security, customer identification screening and regular reporting, which enable its customers to be in compliance with applicable governmental regulations including but not limited to the Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering regulations with final responsibility for compliance resting with the customer. Depending on the extent of changes and new governmental regulations, CoreCard will regularly incur additional costs to modify its software and services to be compliant. CoreCard has no costs related to compliance with environmental laws.\nOur business is not considered seasonal although the use of certain of our products may grow with higher end-of-year spending patterns and possibly cause a small revenue increase during this period.\nResearch and Development\nWe spent $5.2 million and $5.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on Company sponsored research and development. All of our consolidated research and development expense is related to our FinTech business. We maintain a workforce of over 500 employees in our offshore operations in India and Romania for software development and testing, as well as operations support for processing services. We are continuously improving our financial technology software in response to market requirements and trends and expect to continue to do so.\nPatents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets\nWe have one U.S. patent covering aspects of CoreCard\u2019s core software platform. It may be possible for competitors to duplicate certain aspects of our products and processes even though we regard such aspects as proprietary. We have registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and several foreign jurisdictions various trademarks and service marks for our products. We believe that an active trade secret, trade name, trademark, and copyright protection program is one element in developing and maintaining brand recognition and protecting our intellectual property. We presently market our products under trademarks and service marks such as CoreCard, CoreENGINE\u2122, CoreISSUE\u2122, CoreCOLLECT\u2122, CoreMONEY\u2122 and others.\nPersonnel\nAs of February 15, 2021, we had approximately 570 full-time equivalent employees (including our subsidiaries in the United States and foreign countries). Of these, the majority are involved in CoreCard\u2019s software development, testing and operations, and 7 in corporate functions. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, we have not had any work stoppages or strikes, and we believe our employee relations are good.\nFinancial Information About Geographic Areas\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Except for the risk associated with fluctuations in currency, we do not believe there are any specific risks attendant to our foreign operations that are significantly different than the general business risks discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report.",
    "item_7": "ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Summary\nOur consolidated operations consist of our CoreCard Software subsidiary and its affiliate companies in Romania, India and Dubai, as well as a corporate office in Atlanta, Georgia which provides significant administrative, human resources and executive management support to CoreCard.\nWe provide technology solutions and processing services to the financial services market, commonly referred to as the FinTech industry. We derive our product revenue from licensing our comprehensive suite of financial transaction management software to accounts receivable businesses, financial institutions, retailers and processors to manage their credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, private label cards, fleet cards, loyalty programs, and accounts receivable and loan transactions. Our service revenue consists of fees for software maintenance and support for licensed software products, fees for processing services that we provide to companies that outsource their financial transaction processing functions to us, and professional services primarily for software customizations provided to both license and processing customers.\nOur results vary in part depending on the size and number of software licenses recognized as well as the value and number of professional services contracts recognized in a particular period. As we continue to grow our Processing Services business, we continue to gain economies of scale on the investment we have made in the infrastructure, resources, processes and software features developed over the past number of years to support this growing side of our business. We are adding new processing customers at a faster pace than we are adding new license customers, resulting in steady growth in the processing revenue stream. However, we are also experiencing growth in revenue from license customers due to the addition of a large new customer in 2018, referred to as \u201cCustomer A\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In total, this customer represented 69 percent and 60 percent of our consolidated revenues for 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect future professional services, maintenance and license revenue from this customer in 2021 and future years; however, the amount and timing will be dependent on various factors not in our control such as the number of accounts on file and the level of customization needed by the customer. License revenue from this customer, similar to other license arrangements, is tiered based on the number of active accounts on the system. Once the customer achieves each tier level, they receive a perpetual license up to that number of accounts; inactive accounts do not count toward the license tier. The customer receives an unlimited perpetual license at a maximum tier level that allows them to utilize the software for any number of active accounts. They currently use the software for a single institution and additional license fees apply if multiple institutions are added. Support and maintenance fees are charged based on the tier level achieved and increase at new tier levels.\nDuring 2020, we experienced the loss of a large customer due to insolvency, referred to as \u201cCustomer B\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We recognized revenue of $845,000 and $3,700,000 from this customer for the years ended 2020 and 2019, respectively, a decrease of approximately $2,855,000 in 2020 as compared to 2019. We opened offices in Dubai and Chennai and hired some of the insolvent company\u2019s employees and are in the process of converting some of their customers to our processing platform. We expect revenue in 2021 and future years from servicing these customers and adding new customers in the region.\nWe typically receive revenue based on the number of active accounts on file rather than transaction volume and therefore the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic slowdown has had a muted impact on our results. Most of our employees in India have been working remotely throughout the pandemic which has impacted our ability to hire and train new employees. We have been able to maintain key functions and business continuity while delivering growth in our professional services revenue; however, the hiring and training constraints could impact future growth in our professional services revenue.\nThe infrastructure of our multi customer environment is scalable for the future. A significant portion of our expense is related to personnel, including more than 500 employees located in India and Romania. In 2017, we opened a second office in India, located near Mumbai, to enable us to attract the level of talent required for our software development and testing. In October 2020, we opened offices in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Chennai, India to support CoreCard\u2019s expansion of processing services into new markets in the Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and European regions. The new offices include engineering, support and business professionals with significant payments industry experience and experience operating CoreCard\u2019s Processing platforms in the related regions. Our ability to hire and train employees on our processes and software impacts our ability to onboard new customers and deliver professional services for software customizations. In addition, we have certain corporate office expenses associated with being a public company that impact our operating results.\nOur revenue fluctuates from period to period and our results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods. It is difficult to predict the level of consolidated revenue on a quarterly basis for various reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf\nSoftware license revenue in a given period may consist of a relatively small number of contracts, and contract values can vary considerably depending on the software product and scope of the license sold. Consequently, even minor delays in delivery under a software contract, which may be out of our control, could have a significant and unpredictable impact on the consolidated revenue that we recognize in a given quarterly or annual period.\n\u25cf\nCustomers may decide to postpone or cancel a planned implementation of our software for any number of reasons, which may be unrelated to our software or contract performance, that may affect the amount, timing and characterization of our deferred and/or recognized revenue.\n\u25cf\nCustomers typically require our professional services to modify or enhance their CoreCard software implementation based on their specific business strategy and operational requirements, which vary from customer to customer and period to period.\n\u25cf\nThe timing of new processing customer implementations is often dependent on third party approvals or processes which are typically not under our direct control.\nWe continue to maintain a strong cash position. We intend to use cash balances to support the domestic and international operations associated with our CoreCard business and to expand our operations in the FinTech industry through financing the growth of CoreCard and, if appropriate opportunities become available, through acquisitions of businesses in this industry. Additionally, in November 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of $5 million. We made $1.6 million in share repurchases in 2020, and no share repurchases were made in 2019.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this Annual Report.\nRevenue - Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $35,873,000 which represents a 5 percent increase over 2019.\n\u25cf\nRevenue from services was $32,273,000 in 2020, which represents a 13 percent increase from 2019 revenue of $28,578,000. Revenue from transaction processing services, software maintenance and support services, and professional services were greater in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to an increase in the number of customers and accounts on file and an increase in the number and value of professional services contracts completed in 2020. We expect that processing services will continue to grow as our customer base increases; however, the time required to implement new customer programs could be delayed due to third party integration and approval processes and other factors. It is difficult to predict with accuracy the number and value of professional services contracts that our customers will require in a given period. Customers typically request our professional services to modify or enhance their CoreCard software implementation based on their specific business strategy and operational requirements, which vary from customer to customer and period to period.\n\u25cf\nRevenue from products, which includes software license fees was $3,600,000 in 2020, compared to $5,725,000 in 2019. The decrease results from fewer customers achieving new license tiers in 2020 than in 2019.\nCost of Revenue - Total cost of revenue was 43 percent of total revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, compared to 34 percent for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue is primarily driven by investments made in our processing infrastructure including hardware and software purchases and additional space in our data centers. Cost of revenue includes costs to provide annual maintenance and support services to our installed base of licensed customers, costs to provide professional services and costs to provide our financial transaction processing services. The cost and gross margins on such revenues can vary considerably from period to period depending on the customer mix, customer requirements and project complexity as well as the mix of our U.S. and offshore employees working on the various aspects of services provided. In addition, we continue to devote the resources necessary to support our growing processing business, including direct costs for regulatory compliance, infrastructure, network certifications and customer support. We made significant investments in our processing infrastructure in 2020 in anticipation of adding new processing customers in 2021 and future years. These increased costs, primarily depreciation of new hardware and additional data center space, negatively impacted our margins in 2020 and will continue to do so until we add additional customers. However, we do expect future economies of scale in our processing environment. This may be subject to change in the future if new regulations or processing standards are implemented causing us to incur additional costs to comply.\nOperating Expenses - For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, total operating expenses from consolidated operations were slightly lower as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 primarily due to lower research and development expenses, partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses were lower mainly due to lower recognition-based bonus accruals, partially offset by higher payroll and related expense for additional offshore technical personnel. General and administrative expenses increased due to higher stock compensation and salaries expenses due to the new 2020 Non-Employee Directors\u2019 Stock Incentive Plan and an increase in headcount, respectively, partially offset by strategic initiatives of the Board in 2019 that did not recur in 2020. Marketing expenses decreased in 2020 as we continued to place less focus on marketing initiatives for CoreCard. Our client base increased in 2020 and 2019 with minimal marketing efforts as we continue to have prospects contact us via online searches; however, we will continue to re-evaluate our marketing expenditures as needed to competitively position the Processing Services business.\nInvestment Income (Loss) - Investment Income (Loss) was a loss of $1,044,000 in 2020 and income of $34,000 in 2019. In 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $1,009,000 on investments resulting from the economic downturn caused by the recent pandemic.\nOther Income, net - Other Income, net was $378,000 in 2020 and $99,000 in 2019. The increase is primarily due to higher interest income resulting from higher cash and note receivable balances, partially offset by lower interest rates.\nIncome Taxes - We recorded $2,468,000 in 2020 for income tax expense, an effective tax rate of 23.2%, compared to tax expense of $2,546,000 in 2019, an effective tax rate of 18.8%. The 2019 period benefited from an excess tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options. We expect our future effective tax rate to be within the range of 22-24%.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash balance at December 31, 2020 was $37,956,000 compared to $26,415,000 at December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operations was $20,966,000 compared to cash provided by operations of $10,585,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to lower accounts receivable, an increase in cash held for program management funding, higher depreciation and non-cash investment losses. These increases were partially offset by lower net income and lower accrued payroll.\nWe used $6,875,000 of cash to acquire computer equipment and related software primarily to enhance our existing processing environment in the U.S. as well for computer equipment for the technical resources added in our India office during 2020.\nWe do not expect to pay any regular or special dividends in the foreseeable future. We expect to have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand as well as projected customer payments to support our operations and capital equipment purchases in the foreseeable future. Currently we expect to use cash in excess of what is required for our current operations for opportunities we believe will expand our FinTech business, as exemplified in transactions described in Notes 3 and 5, although there can be no assurance that appropriate opportunities will arise. Additionally, in November 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of $5 million. We made share repurchases of $1.6 million in 2020, and we did not make any share repurchases in 2019.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and valuation of investments to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. For a detailed description on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition - Product revenue consists of fees from software licenses. Service revenue consists of fees for processing services; professional services for software customization, consulting, and training; reimbursable expenses; and software maintenance and customer support.\nOur software license arrangements generally fall into one of the following four categories:\n\u25cf\nan initial contract with the customer to license certain software modules, to provide services to get the customer live on the software (such as training and customization) and to provide post contract support (\u201cPCS\u201d) for a specified period of time thereafter,\n\u25cf\npurchase of additional licenses for new modules or for tier upgrades for a higher volume of licensed accounts after the initial contract,\n\u25cf\nother optional standalone contracts, usually performed after the customer is live on the software, for services such as new interfaces or custom features requested by the customer, additional training and problem resolution not covered in annual maintenance contracts, or\n\u25cf\ncontracts for certain licensed software products that involve an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees during the contract life.\nAt contract inception, we assess the products and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a product or service (or bundle of products or services) that is distinct. A performance obligation is distinct if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. To identify our performance obligations, we consider all of the products or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. We recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer. Our revenue recognition policies for each of the situations described above are discussed below.\nOur software licenses generally have significant stand-alone functionality to the customer upon delivery and are considered to be functional intellectual property. Additionally, the purpose in granting these software licenses to a customer is typically to provide the customer a right to use our intellectual property. Our software licenses are generally considered distinct performance obligations, and revenue allocated to the software license is typically recognized at a point in time upon delivery of the license. Initial implementation fees do not meet the criteria for separate accounting because the software usually requires significant modification or customization that is essential to its functionality. We recognize revenue related to implementations over the life of the customer once the implementation is complete.\nWe account for the PCS element contained in the initial contract based on relative standalone selling price, which is annual renewal fees for such services, and PCS is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the period specified in the contract as we generally satisfy these performance obligations evenly using a time-elapsed output method over the contract term given there is no discernible pattern of performance. Upon renewal of the PCS contract by the customer, we recognize revenues ratably on a straight-line basis over the period specified in the PCS contract. All of our software customers purchase software maintenance and support contracts and renew such contracts annually.\nCertain initial software contracts contain specified future service elements for scheduled completion following the implementation, and related recognition, of the initial license. In these instances, after the initial license recognition, where distinct future performance obligations are identified in the contract and we could reliably measure the completion of each identified performance obligation, we have recognized revenue at the time the individual performance obligation was completed.\nPurchases of additional licenses for tier upgrades or additional modules are generally recognized as license revenue in the period in which the purchase is made for perpetual licenses or ratably over the remaining contract term for non-perpetual licenses.\nServices provided under standalone contracts that are optional to the customer and are outside of the scope of the initial contract are single element services contracts. These standalone services contracts are not essential to the functionality of the software contained in the initial contract and generally do not include acceptance clauses or refund rights as may be included in the initial software contracts, as described above. Revenues from these services contracts, which are generally performed within a relatively short period of time, are recognized when the services are complete or in some cases as the services are provided. These revenues generally re-occur as contracts are renewed. Payment terms for professional services may be based on an upfront fixed fee with the remainder due upon completion or on a time and materials basis.\nFor contracts for licensed software which include an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees for software usage, maintenance and support, we recognize the total fees ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the contract as services revenue.\nRevenues from processing services are typically volume- or activity-based depending on factors such as the number of accounts processed, number of accounts on the system, number of hours of services or computer resources used. For processing services which include an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees for services, we recognize the initial fees ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the contract as services revenue. The payment terms may include tiered pricing structures with the base tier representing a minimum monthly usage fee. For processing services revenues, we stand ready to provide continuous access to our processing platforms and perform an unspecified quantity of outsourced and transaction-processing services for a specified term or terms. Accordingly, processing services are generally viewed as a stand-ready performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct daily services. We typically satisfy our processing services performance obligations over time as the services are provided.\nTechnology or service components from third parties are frequently embedded in or combined with our products or service offerings. We are often responsible for billing the client in these arrangements and transmitting the applicable fees to the third party. We determine whether we are responsible for providing the actual product or service as a principal, or for arranging for the solution or service to be provided by the third party as an agent. Judgment is applied to determine whether we are the principal or the agent by evaluating whether we have control of the product or service prior to it being transferred to the customer. The principal versus agent assessment is performed at the performance obligation level. Indicators that we consider in determining if we have control include whether we are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified product or service to the customer, whether we have inventory risk and discretion in establishing the price the customer ultimately pays for the product or service. Depending upon the level of our contractual responsibilities and obligations for delivering solutions to end customers, we have arrangements where we are the principal and recognize the gross amount billed to the customer and other arrangements where we are the agent and recognize the net amount retained.\nRevenue is recorded net of applicable sales tax.\nDeferred revenue consists of advance payments by software customers for annual or quarterly PCS, advance payments from customers for software licenses and professional services not yet delivered, and initial implementation payments for processing services or bundled license and support services in multi-year contracts. Deferred revenue is classified as long-term until such time that it becomes likely that the services or products will be provided within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\nValuation of Investments - We hold minority interests in non-publicly traded companies whose values are not readily determinable and are based on management\u2019s estimate of realizability of the value of the investment. Future adverse changes in market conditions, poor operating results, lack of progress of the investee company or its inability to raise capital to support its business plan could result in investment losses or an inability to recover the current carrying value of the investment. Our policy with respect to minority interests is to record an impairment charge when we conclude an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. At least quarterly, we review our investments to determine any impairment in their carrying value and we write-down any impaired asset at quarter-end to our best estimate of its current realizable value.\nWe have an equity investment and various loans with a privately held identity and professional services company with ties to the FinTech industry. A portion of the company\u2019s business has been negatively impacted by the pandemic while other portions of its business have improved. We evaluate on a continuing basis whether any impairment indicators are present that would require additional analysis or write-downs of the investment. While we have not recorded an impairment related to this investment or determined that an impairment trigger existed at December 31, 2020, significant variations from current expectations could impact future assessments resulting in future impairment charges.\nWe also have an investment with a privately held technology company and program manager in the FinTech industry. In the first quarter of 2020, due to the economic downturn resulting from the recent pandemic, we recorded an impairment charge of $750,000 to reduce the carrying value of the investee company to $0.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nFactors That May Affect Future Operations\nFuture operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact our future results of operations or projected cash requirements. It is difficult to predict future quarterly and annual results with certainty.\nAmong the numerous factors that may affect our consolidated results of operations or financial condition are the following:\n\u25cf\nWeakness or instability in the global financial markets could have a negative impact due to potential customers (most of whom perform some type of financial services) delaying decisions to purchase software or initiate processing services.\n\u25cf\nIncreased federal and state regulations and reluctance by financial institutions to act as sponsor banks for prospective customers could result in losses and additional cash requirements.\n\u25cf\nOur largest customer represented 69% of our consolidated revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Failure to meet our responsibilities under the related contract could result in breach of contract and loss of the customer and related future revenues.\n\u25cf\nDelays in software development projects could cause our customers to postpone implementations or delay payments, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenue and cash.\n\u25cf\nWe could fail to deliver software products which meet the business and technology requirements of our target markets within a reasonable time frame and at a price point that supports a profitable, sustainable business model.\n\u25cf\nOur processing business is impacted, directly or indirectly, by more regulations than our licensed software business. If we fail to provide services that comply with (or allow our customers to comply with) applicable regulations or processing standards, we could be subject to financial or other penalties that could negatively impact our business.\n\u25cf\nSoftware errors or poor quality control may delay product releases, increase our costs, result in non-acceptance of our software by customers or delay revenue recognition.\n\u25cf\nWe could fail to expand our base of customers as quickly as anticipated, resulting in lower revenue and profits and increased cash needs.\n\u25cf\nWe could fail to retain key software developers and managers who have accumulated years of know-how in our target markets and company products or fail to attract and train a sufficient number of new software developers and testers to support our product development plans and customer requirements at projected cost levels.\n\u25cf\nIncreasing and changing government regulations in the United States and foreign countries related to such issues as data privacy, financial and credit transactions could require changes to our products and services which could increase our costs and could affect our existing customer relationships or prevent us from getting new customers.\n\u25cf\nDelays in anticipated customer payments for any reason would increase our cash requirements and could adversely impact our profits.\n\u25cf\nCompetitive pressures (including pricing, changes in customer requirements and preferences, and competitor product offerings) may cause prospective customers to choose an alternative product solution, resulting in lower revenue and profits (or losses).\n\u25cf\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and depend on a number of factors; additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\n\u25cf\nVolatility in the markets, including as a result of political instability, civil unrest, war or terrorism, or pandemics or other natural disasters, such as the recent outbreak of coronavirus, could adversely affect future results of operations and could negatively impact the valuation of our investments.\n\u25cf\nOther general economic and political conditions could cause customers to delay or cancel purchases.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements - Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.",

(the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201ciSign\u201d), was incorporated in Delaware in October 1986. iSign is a leading supplier of digital transaction management (DTM) software enabling the paperless, secure and cost-effective management and authentication of document-based transactions. iSign\u2019s solutions encompass a wide array of functionality and services, including electronic signatures, simple-to-complex workflow management and various options for biometric authentication. These solutions are available across virtually all enterprise, desktop and mobile environments as a seamlessly integrated platform for both ad-hoc and fully automated transactions. iSign\u2019s platform can be deployed both on premise and as a cloud-based (\u201cSaaS\u201d) service, with the ability to easily transition between deployment models. The Company is headquartered in San Jose, California.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the U.S. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition, several states in the U.S., including California, where the Company is headquartered, have experienced an increase of new cases of COVID-19. It is uncertain if this trend will continue into 2021, as shown by the recent uptick in reported cases. The COVID-19 outbreak is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a wide range of industries. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenue was $966, an increase of $122, or 14%, compared to total revenue of $844 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, software product revenue was $247, an increase of $52, or 27%, compared to product revenue of $195 in the prior year. Maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $719, an increase of $70, or 11%, compared to maintenance revenue of $649 in the prior year. These increases are primarily attributable to the Company\u2019s growth in recurring revenue and related engineering services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the net loss was $528, a decrease of $558, or 51%, compared to $1,086 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, non-cash charges, consisting of interest expense, warrant expense and the amortization of debt discount were $293, a decrease of $11, or 4%, compared to $304 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, operating expenses were $1,619, a decrease of $8, or 0.5%, compared to operating expenses of $1,627 for the prior year. The decrease in operating expenses resulted from reductions in the amortization of stock options and warrant compensation and professional service expenses.\nCore Technologies\nThe Company\u2019s core technologies can be referred to as \u201ctransaction-enabling\u201d and \u201cbusiness process work flow\u201d technologies. These technologies include various forms of electronic signature methods, such as handwritten, biometric, click-to-sign and others, as well as technologies related to signature verification, authentication, cryptography and the logging of audit trails to prove signers\u2019 intent. These technologies enable the appending of secure, legal and regulatory compliant electronic signatures coupled with an enhanced user experience, all at a fraction of the time and cost required by traditional, paper-based processes for signature capture.\nProducts\nThe Company\u2019s enterprise-class SignatureOne\u00ae and iSign\u00ae suite of electronic signature solutions enable businesses to implement truly paperless, electronic signature-driven business processes. The aggregate of the software functionality enabling the digitization of end-to-end work flow processes is sometimes referred to as \u201cdigital transaction management\u201d (DTM). Many applications provide electronic forms and allow users to fill-in information, but most of these applications still require users to print out a paper copy for a handwritten, ink signature. Solutions powered by iSign products allow legally binding electronic signatures to be added to digital documents, eliminating the need for paper to memorialize the completion, approval or authentication of the transaction. This allows users to reduce transaction times and processing costs.\nThe SignatureOne\u00ae and iSign\u00ae suite of products includes the following:\nSignatureOne\u00ae Ceremony\u00ae Server The SignatureOne\u00ae Ceremony\u00ae Server (\u201cCeremony Server\u201d) provides a highly secure, scalable, patent-protected and streamlined electronic signature solution.

The Company has a policy of requiring its employees and contractors to commit to the protection of proprietary information through written agreements. The Company also has a policy of requiring prospective business partners to enter into non-disclosure agreements before disclosure of any of its proprietary information.\nOver the years, the Company has developed and patented major elements of its software offerings and technologies. The Company currently has the following applications pending:\nPatent App. No.\nFiling Date\n14/650,271\nJune 5, 2015\n14/455,425\nAugust 8, 2014\nThe Company\u2019s technologies go beyond simple electronic signature and include biometric signatures, verification solutions, authentication and validation methods, that result in signed documents that are secure, legal and tamper-resistant.\nThe Company has over 20 registered and unregistered trademarks in the United States and other countries. The Company intends to register its trademarks in those jurisdictions where significant marketing of its products will be undertaken in the foreseeable future.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development effort is focused on the development, advancement and refinement of our core products and the development of new products. In addition, our research and development team is responsible for the continuous quality measurement and assurance of both existing and new products. We conduct research on software technology, related computer hardware, competitive offerings and alternative solution approaches to develop appropriate product and service offerings for our target markets. Our research and development efforts are often aimed at assisting clients and licensees in further streamlining new and existing workflow processes that our software solutions support and at ensuring that we meet or exceed industry standards and competitive offerings. We provide certain customization and integration services to our clients, including software integration partners and enterprise customers. These efforts are conducted by our team in San Jose, California, supported by contracted staff, including offshore engineers.\nWe believe that our software technologies, platforms and products are now competitive and, while research and development activities will remain at the core of our operations, we intend, going forward, to invest an increasing amount of our resources in sales and marketing activities.\nOur research and development expense was $578 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $630 for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nMaterial Customers\nHistorically, the Company\u2019s revenue has been derived from hundreds of customers, but a significant percentage of the revenue has been attributable to a limited number of customers. Four customers, as described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial statements, accounted for 10%, 23%, 23% and 25%, respectively, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSeasonality of Business\nThe Company believes that the sale of its products is not subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nBacklog\nBacklog was approximately $215 and $416 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, representing advanced payments on product and service maintenance agreements. One customer decided to convert their December renewal of a $94 annual maintenance contract to a maintenance contract on a time and materials basis in 2021.\nCompetition\nWe believe that our primary competitive advantages include the following:\n\u25cf Customer options and platform flexibility: Unlike most of our competitors, we offer many flexible configuration options for enterprise clients to address many variants of complex business work flows without the need for costly and time-consuming customization. These solution configurations can be rapidly and seamlessly integrated into a variety of enterprise technology environments.\n\u25cf Software deployment options: Unlike most of our competitors, our software solutions are available as an on demand, private cloud-based software as a service, and on the customer\u2019s premises, which is an important feature for most of our large enterprise clients for compliance, security and control reasons.\n\u25cf Lower cost structure: Through our technology, sales and marketing partners, including Cegedim SA, we believe we offer a lower relative cost structure and higher operating margin than most of our larger competitors.\nCurrently, our primary competition for basic click-to-sign electronic signatures includes Adobe EchoSign, DocuSign and OneSpan (f.k.a. VASCO Data Security International Inc.). We view the balance of the U.S. market as fragmented with a variety of smaller competitors focused on the consumer and small business markets rather than enterprise organizations.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company employed five full-time employees, one part time employee and eight independent contractors. The Company has established longstanding strategic relationships that allow it to rapidly access product development and deployment capabilities that could be required to address most customer requirements. None of the Company\u2019s employees are party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe our employee relations are good.\nGeographic Areas\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, sales in the United States as a percentage of total sales was 75% and 80%, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, long-lived assets located in the United States were $10 and $13, respectively. There were no long-lived assets located elsewhere as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nSegments\nThe Company reports its financial results in one segment.\nAvailable Information\nOur web site is located at www.isignnow.com.

    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following discussion relating to projected growth and future results and events constitutes forward-looking statements. Actual results in future periods may differ materially from the forward-looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties. We cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as otherwise required under applicable law, we disclaim any obligation to revise or update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.\nUnless otherwise stated herein, all figures in this Item 7, other than price per share data, are stated in thousands (\u201c000s\u201d).\nOverview and Recent Developments\nThe Company is a leading supplier of DTM software enabling the paperless, secure and cost-effective management and authentication of document-based transactions. iSign\u2019s solutions encompass a wide array of functionality and services, including electronic signatures, simple-to-complex workflow management and various options for biometric authentication. These solutions are available across virtually all enterprise, desktop and mobile environments as a seamlessly integrated platform for both ad-hoc and fully automated transactions. The Company\u2019s products and services result in legally binding transactions that are compliant with applicable laws and regulations and that can provide a higher level of security than paper-based processes. The Company has been a leading supplier of enterprise software solutions within the financial services and insurance industries and has made available to its customers significant expense reduction by enabling a completely electronic document and workflow process, as well as the resulting reduction in mailing, scanning, filing and other costs related to the use of paper.\nThe Company was incorporated in Delaware in October 1986. Except for the year ended December 31, 2004, in each year since its inception the Company has incurred losses. For the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, the net loss aggregated approximately $1,761, and at December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s accumulated deficit was approximately $135,350.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the U.S. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition, several states in the U.S., including California, where the Company is headquartered, have experienced an increase of new cases of COVID-19. It is uncertain if this trend will continue into the 2021, as shown by the recent uptick in reported cases. The COVID-19 outbreak is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a wide range of industries. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers, employees and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenue was $966, an increase of $122, or 14%, compared to total revenue of $844 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, software product revenue was $247, an increase of $52, or 27%, compared to product revenue of $195 in the prior year. Maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $719, an increase of $70, or 11%, compared to maintenance revenue of $649 in the prior year. These increases are primarily attributable to the Company\u2019s growth in recurring revenue and related engineering services.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, operating expenses were $1,619, a decrease of $8, or 0.5%, compared to operating expenses of $1,627 in the prior year. The decrease in operating expense resulted from reductions in the amortization of stock options and professional service expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the loss from operations was $653, a decrease of $130, or 17%, compared to a loss from operations of $783 in the prior year.\nOn May 6, 2020, the Company received loan proceeds in the amount of approximately $123 under the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The Companies may apply for the loans and accrued interest to be forgiven after a period of either eight or twenty-four weeks, as long as the borrower uses the loan proceeds for eligible purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities, and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness may be reduced if the borrower terminates employees or reduces salaries during the period in question. Under the terms of the related promissory note, the unforgiven portion of the PPP loan is payable over two years at an interest rate of 1%, with a deferral of payments for the first six months. The Company used the proceeds for purposes consistent with the PPP. While the Company currently believes that its use of the loan proceeds, for the most part, meet the conditions for forgiveness of the loan, we cannot assure you that we did not take actions that caused the Company to be ineligible for forgiveness of the loan, in whole or in part.\nThe Company recorded $3 in debt discount amortization for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 related to its debt financings.\nOn January 28, 2020, the Company issued 30 warrants to a consultant for services. The warrants are exercisable for three years with an exercise price of $0.50 per share. The Company ascribed a value of $13 to the warrants based on the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The warrant cost was charged to general and administrative expense during the period.\nOn July 9, 2020, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a vendor. In addition to a cash payment the Company issued 10 warrants to purchase 10 shares of common stock in settlement of the outstanding accounts payable balance. The warrants are exercisable for five years with an exercise price of $0.50 per share. The Company ascribed a value of $3 to the warrants based on the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The warrant cost was charged to general and administrative expense during the period.\nOn August 11, 2020, the Company issued warrants to purchase 425 shares of common stock to two consultants associated with their unpaid consulting fees. The Company ascribed a value of $160 to the warrants which is booked as stock based compensation in general and administrative expense in the statement of operations. The warrants are only exercisable for deferred consulting fees. Upon exercise, the Company would not receive any cash and would reduce accrued expenses. The above warrants have a three year life from the date of grant and an exercise price of $0.50 per share.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part IV, Item 15 of this report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in its balance sheets and the amounts of revenue and expenses reported for each period presented are affected by these estimates and assumptions that are used for, but not limited to, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, intangible asset impairments, fair value of financial instruments, stock based compensation and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments, assumptions and estimates used by the Company\u2019s management in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\nStock based Compensation: Stock-based compensation expense is based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest during the period. The grant date fair value of stock-based awards to employees and directors is calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Forfeitures of share-based payment awards are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated and it is assumed no dividends will be declared. The estimated fair value of stock-based compensation awards to employees is amortized on an accrual basis over the vesting period of the options.\nValuation of equity warrants: The Company values warrants issued using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model.\nDerivatives: The Company follows the relevant accounting guidance and records derivative instruments (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) in the consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at their fair value, with changes in the derivative\u2019s fair value recognized currently in earnings. The Company values these derivative securities under the fair value method at the end of each reporting period (quarter), and their value is marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period with the gain or loss recorded in earnings. The Company continues to revalue these instruments each quarter to reflect their current value in light of the current market price of our Common Stock. The Company used a simulated probability valuation model to value warrants containing embedded derivative instruments. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of such warrants requires considerable judgment. Any change in the estimates (specifically, probabilities) used may cause the value to be higher or lower than that reported. The assumptions used in the model require significant judgment by management and include the following: volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, dividends, and warrant holders\u2019 expected rate of return, reset provisions based on expected future financings, projected stock prices, and probability of exercise.\nThe conversion option included within the unsecured convertible promissory notes is accounted for as a derivative liability at its estimated fair value. The derivative is subject to re-measurement at the end of each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized as a component of interest and other income, in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the conversion or maturity of the unsecured convertible promissory note purchase agreements.\nRevenue: The Company\u2019s principal sources of revenues are from the sale of software products, SOW (engineering services), annual software product, and software maintenance contracts. The Company also derives revenue from customers based on the numbers of signatures produced by the Company\u2019s signature software solutions imbedded within the customer\u2019s product.\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized using the following five steps:\na) Identify the contract(s) with a customer;\nb) Identify the performance obligations (a good or service) in the contract;\nc) Determine the transaction price; for each performance obligation within the contract\nd) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\ne) Recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation.\nContracts contain performance obligation(s) for the transfer goods or services to a customer. The performance obligations are a promise (or a group of promises) that are distinct. The transaction price is the amount of consideration a Company expects to receive from a customer in exchange for satisfying the performance obligations specified in the contract.\nContracts may contain one or more performance obligations (a good or service). Performance obligations are accounted for separately if they are distinct. A good or service is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources readily available to the customer, and the good or service is distinct in the context of the contract. Otherwise performance obligations will be combined with other promised goods or services until the Company identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is allocated to all separate performance obligations within the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices (\u201cSSP\u201d). The best evidence for SSP is the price the Company would charge for that good or service when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. If goods or services are not always sold separately, the Company would use the best estimate of SSP in the allocation of transaction price.\nThe transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services, which may include an estimate of variable consideration to the extent that it is probable of not being subject to significant reversals in the future based on the Company\u2019s experience with similar arrangements. The transaction price also reflects the impact of the time value of money if there is a significant financing component present in an arrangement. The transaction price excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes.\nRevenue is recognized when the Company satisfies each performance obligation identified within the contract by transferring control of the promised goods or services to the customer. Goods or services can transfer at a point in time or over time depending on the nature of the arrangement.\nDeferred revenue represents the Company\u2019s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration from the customer. Our payment terms do not vary by the type of products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $413 of revenue that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period.\nContract assets exist when the Company has satisfied a performance obligation but does not have an unconditional right to consideration (e.g., because the entity first must satisfy another performance obligation in the contract before it is entitled to invoice the customer).\nThe Company transfers all of its goods and services electronically with the associated costs recorded in cost of sales in the Company\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSoftware. Revenue from the sale of software products is recognized when the control is transferred. For most of the Company\u2019s software product sales, the control is transferred at the time the product is electronically transferred because the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and the Company has a present right to payment at that time.\nStatement of Work (SOW). Revenue from SOW (engineering services) is recognized upon completion, transfer and satisfaction of the performance obligations identified with in the contract by the customer.\nTransactional revenue. For transactional type contracts, the Company\u2019s performance obligations are met upon transfer of the software master to the customer. Revenue from transactional customers is recognized as the customer reports the number of units (signatures) rendered over the specified reporting period, generally three months.\nRecurring Product revenue. The company has revenue contracts that allow the customer to utilize the Company\u2019s signature software on an annual basis. Maintenance and support costs are included in the annual price to the customer. The customer has the right to renew or cancel the contract on an annual basis. Recurring revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period, generally one year.\nMaintenance and support. Maintenance and support services are satisfied ratably over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services. As a result, support and maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the contract.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations. The Company has, from time to time, revenue arrangements that include multiple performance obligations. The Company allocates transaction price to all separate performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices (\u201cSSP\u201d). The Company\u2019s best evidence for SSP is the price the Company would charge for that good or service when the Company sells it separately in similar circumstances to similar customers. If goods or services are not always sold separately, the Company uses the best estimate of SSP in the allocation of transaction price. The Company\u2019s process for determining best estimate of SSP involves management\u2019s judgment, and considers multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices may vary over time, depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. If the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and circumstances lead the Company to consider additional factors, the Company\u2019s best estimate of SSP may also change.\nContract costs. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are capitalized if the costs are expected to be recovered. Costs that are recognized as assets are amortized straight-line over the period as the related goods or services transfer to the customer. Costs incurred to fulfill a contract are capitalized if they are not covered by other relevant guidance, relate directly to a contract, will be used to satisfy future performance obligations, and are expected to be recovered.\nSignificant Judgments. The Company may exercise significant judgment when determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together.\nPractical Expedients and Exemptions. Under Topic 606, incremental costs of obtaining a contract, such as sales commissions, are capitalized if they are expected to be recovered. Expensing these costs as they are incurred is not permitted unless they qualify for the practical expedient. The Company elected the practical expedient to expense the costs to obtain a contract as incurred when the expected amortization period is one year or less.\nThe Company elected the practical expedient under Topic 606 to not disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, since the majority of the Company\u2019s arrangements have original expected durations of one year or less, or the invoicing corresponds to the value of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date.\nThe Company elected the practical expedient that allows the Company to not assess a contract for a significant financing component if the period between the customer\u2019s payment and the transfer of the goods or services is one year or less.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts: The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company\u2019s assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts and an assessment of international, political and economic risk as well as the aging of the accounts receivable. If there is a change in actual defaults from the Company\u2019s historical experience, the Company\u2019s estimates of recoverability of amounts due could be affected and the Company would adjust the allowance accordingly.\nLong-lived assets: The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets, including intangible assets at least annually or whenever circumstances or events indicate such assets might be impaired. The Company would recognize an impairment charge in the event the net book value of such assets exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. Estimation of future cash flows from the products considers the following additional factors:\n\u25cf legal, regulatory or contractual provisions known to the Company that limit the useful life of any product technology to less than the assigned useful life;\n\u25cf whether the Company needs to incur material costs or make modifications in order for it to continue to be able to realize the benefits afforded by the product technologies;\n\u25cf effects of obsolescence or significant competitive pressure on the Company\u2019s current or future products are expected to reduce the anticipated cash flow from the products;\n\u25cf demand for products utilizing the technology will diminish, remain stable or increase; and\n\u25cf whether the current markets for the products based on the technology will remain constant or will change over the useful lives assigned to the technologies.\nCustomer Base: To date, the Company\u2019s electronic signature revenue has been derived primarily from financial service industry end-users and from resellers and channel partners serving the financial service industry primarily in North America, the ASEAN Region and Europe. The Company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses. Historically, such losses have been within the range of management\u2019s expectations.\nCost of sales: Cost of sales includes direct engineering labor and overhead for specific revenue based projects initiated by customers and maintenance projects specific to customer needs, along with third party services related to the Company\u2019s transactional based revenues.\nResearch and Development Costs: Research and development costs are charged as expense as incurred.\nNet Operating Loss Carry-forwards: Utilization of the Company\u2019s net operating losses may be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. As a result, a portion of the Company\u2019s net operating loss carry-forwards may not be available to offset future taxable income. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 of approximately $65,121 based upon the Company\u2019s history of losses.\nSegments: The Company reports its financial results in one segment.\nRevision to Financial Statements for the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nThe Company is revising its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 to revise the reporting for certain warrants issued by the Company on February 6, 2019 to four consultants and one employee to purchase 985 shares of common stock and other miscellaneous reclassifications.\nResults of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, total revenue was $966, an increase of $122, or 14%, compared to total revenue of $844 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, software product revenue was $247, an increase of $52, or 27%, compared to product revenue of $195 in the prior year. Maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $719, an increase of $70, or 11%, compared to maintenance revenue of $649 in the prior year. The increase in product revenue is primarily attributable to the increase in engineering service revenue. The increase in maintenance revenue is primarily attributable to existing customers renewing maintenance contracts at higher price points.\nCost of Sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cost of sales was $146, an increase of $25, or 21%, compared to cost of sales of $121 in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in direct engineering costs associated with the mix of engineering service and software product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development expenses were $578, a decrease of $52, or 8%, compared to research and development expenses of $630 in the prior year. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, outside contract engineering, maintenance items, and allocated facility expenses. The most significant factors contributing to the decrease in research and development expenses was a decrease in stock option expense, a reduction in outside engineering expense and the reduction in allocated facilities expenses. These reductions were enhanced by an increase in direct labor transfers to cost of sales due to the increase in engineering service revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, total research and development expenses before IT and cost of sales allocations were $723, a decrease of $27, or 4%, compared to $750 of total research and development expenses before allocations in the prior year.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, sales and marketing expenses were $83, a decrease of $26, or 24%, compared to sales and marketing expenses of $109 in the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in sales to non-commissionable accounts.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, administrative expenses were $812, an increase of $45, or 6%, compared to administrative expenses of $767 in the prior year. The increase was due to an increase in warrant expense of $108 issued in connection to deferred compensation, offset by a decrease of $57 in stock option compensation. All other overhead expenses increased $6.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $435, an increase of $433, or 21650%, compared to income of $2 in the prior year. The increase in other income and expense is due primarily to the forgiveness of $435 of accounts payable during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Such forgiveness was generated in conjunction with cash payments of approximately $286.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, related party interest expense was $104, an increase of $30, or 41%, compared to related party interest expense of $74 in the prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, other interest expense was $202, an increase of $8, or 4%, compared to other interest expense of $194 in the prior year. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to the increase in borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $3 in debt discount amortization associated with its short-term borrowings, $1 of which is attributable to related parties and $2 of which is attributable to other investors, compared to $36 in the prior year, $10 of which is attributable to related parties and $26 of which is attributable to other investors. The decrease in debt discount amortization was primarily due to the extension of the due date of the notes from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 the entire amount of debt discount has been fully written off.\nThe due date of the notes was extended again in November 2020 to December 31, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $26 at December 31, 2020, compared to $25 at December 31, 2019.\nThe cash used in operations was primarily attributable to the net loss of $528. This amount was partially offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization of $6, amortization of warrants associated with long-term liabilities of $160, the issuance of warrants valued at $16 for services and stock-based compensation of $103.\nCash out flows for the acquisition of property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.\nAccounts receivable were $100 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $39, or 64%, compared to accounts receivable of $61 at December 31, 2019. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily attributable to an increase in orders billed in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets were $10 at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $12, or 55%, compared to prepaid expenses and other current assets of $22 at December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the transfer to cost of sales of prepaid engineering expense associated with current year revenue.\nShort-term debt was $2,995 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $749, or 33%, compared to $2,246 in the prior year. See financing transactions below. Short term debt includes principal amount on notes for $2,649, accounts receivable advances of $183, a PPP loan of $123 and a vendor note of $40.The Company negotiated an extension of the due date of the notes to December 31, 2021\nAccounts payable were $353 at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $843, or 70%, compared to $1,196 at December 31, 2019. The decrease is due primarily to the forgiveness of $435 of accounts payable, related cash payments of approximately $286 and the issuance of a note payable of $130. These payments and other reductions were offset by the addition of $8 in new accounts payable.\nAccrued compensation was $82 at December 31, 2020, an increase of $11 or 15%, compared to $71 at December 31, 2019. The increase was due primarily to the accrual of commissions and an increase in accrued vacation. Deferred compensation of $219 was reclassified from other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2020 and represents amounts owed to former employees.\nOther accrued liabilities including the long term portion were $1,879 at December 31, 2020, compared to $1,630 at December 31, 2019, an increase of $249, or 15%. The increase is primarily attributable to the accrual of certain franchise taxes and professional service fees.\nDeferred revenue was $215 at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $201, or 48%, compared to deferred revenue, including the long-term portion, of $416 at December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the shift of one customer to a time and material basis rather than a prepayment bases and an increase in the amount of uncollected maintenance billed in the fourth quarter of 2019. The Company records deferred maintenance when the billing is collected.\nFinancing Transactions\nAdvances:\nDuring the current year the Company received advances against certain accounts receivable of $183, net of a partial repayment of $20 in December 2020 upon collection of the receivable in November of 2020.\nDebt:\nIn May of 2020 the Company applied for and received a PPP loan of $123. The Company used the proceeds for purposes consistent with the PPP. While the Company currently believes that its use of the loan proceeds meets the conditions for forgiveness of the loan, we cannot assure you that we did not take actions that caused the Company to be ineligible for forgiveness of the loan, in whole or in part.\nOn March 25, 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of $150 in unsecured notes to affiliates and other investors. The Company received $75 in cash and $75 in exchange for accounts receivable advances. The unsecured notes are convertible by the holder into common stock at any time at a price per share of $0.50. Upon closing a new financing of at least $1,000 in aggregate proceeds, the Company can force conversion at a price equal to the lesser of $0.50 per share or the price per share of the new financing. The notes bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum and are due December 31, 2021.\nOn June 19, 2020, the Company issued an additional unsecured note for $250,000. The note has the same terms and maturity date as the Company\u2019s other unsecured notes.\nOn July 1, 2020 the Company entered into a settlement agreement with one of its vendors whereby the Company paid $135 in cash and issued a promissory note in the amount of $130 in settlement of approximately $537 in outstanding accounts payable. The note bears interest at the rate of 4% per annum and is due in installments of $40, $45 and $45 on or before the anniversary date of the note over the next three years. The settlement agreement discussed above resulted in gain of $272 recorded as other income in the statement of operations.\nThe Company recorded $3 in debt discount amortization for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 related to prior year debt financings, $1 was to related parties and $2 was to other investors.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company had no material commitments as of December 31, 2020.",

As a result of the Business Combination, RBC became a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of B4MC. In September 2018 B4MC changed its name to RocketFuel Blockchain, Inc. References to \u201cwe\u201d and similar terms in this report are to B4MC after the consummation of the Business Transaction.\nPrior to the Business Combination, B4MC was a \u201cshell company,\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. As a result of the Business Combination, we have ceased to be a \u201cshell company.\u201d\nThe Business Combination was treated as a \u201creverse acquisition\u201d of RBC for financial accounting purposes. RBC was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes, and the historical financial statements of BFMC before the Business Combination were replaced with the historical financial statements of RBC before the Business Combination in all future filings with the SEC. The Purchaser Common Stock issued to the Sellers in connection with the Business Combination have not been registered under the Securities Act, in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2), which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering, Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated by the SEC under that section.

In this report, references to RocketFuel, the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and similar terms are to B4MC following the consummation of the reverse acquisition.

For further information, please refer to the copy of the Contribution Agreement included as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K which was filed with the SEC on June 29, 2018. There are representations and warranties contained in the Contribution Agreement that were made by the parties to each other as of the date of execution. The assertions embodied in these representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the Contribution Agreement and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating their terms. Moreover, some representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date because they are subject to a contractual standard of materiality that is different from certain standards generally applicable to shareholders or were used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. For these reasons, investors should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Contribution Agreement as statements of factual information.\nOur Business\nWe provide check-out and payment systems that securely automate and simplify the way online payment and shipping information is received by merchants from their customers. Our \u201cone click\u201d checkout solution is modeled on the \u201cbuy now\u201d button on leading eCommerce sites. Our check-out systems are designed to enhance customers\u2019 data protection, enabling consumers to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies or by direct transfers from their bank accounts without exposing spending credentials such as credit card data. At the same time, our check-out systems are designed to increase the speed, security and ease of use for both customers and merchants and include a merchant portal that provides detailed transactions and metrics about payments received by the merchant. They also include a customer portal where shoppers are able to track their payments, configure payment defaults and connect with various cryptocurrency exchanges and banks to facilitate payment to merchants. Merchants are able to integrate a unique pop-up user interface that allows customers to pay directly from their ecommerce checkout page with no need to redirect to another website or web page.\nOur merchant portal is updated instantly when a payment transaction is made on the merchant website. The merchant is notified of the transaction and can see the transaction details, including the customer that made the transaction, the transaction amount and the transaction items. This information is added to the merchant dashboard where various metrics are tracked and displayed to the merchant, including information about the various cryptocurrencies that are used for payments to that merchant and the different currencies received by the merchant as payment. In addition to various metrics, merchants are able to see a variety of reports, and are able to configure various options including settlement options from their portal.\nCustomers of merchants that use the RocketFuel payment solution are able to track their payments in their online portal. They are also able to track payments they made to all the merchants that are integrated with the RocketFuel payment technology within one consolidated user portal. They are currently able to connect to their accounts on Coinbase and in the future we plan to add connectivity to Binance, Kraken, Gemini and other exchanges. They can also pay from any cryptocurrency wallet. Customers are able to pay from bank accounts as well. These customers are able to make payment with any of these payment options with 1, 2, or 3 clicks from the merchant checkout page. By default, these customers can choose from dozens of cryptocurrencies to pay from.\nOur payment user interface allows customers to easily onboard as well as to pay for merchants\u2019 products or services with a variety of cryptocurrencies or via bank transfers. The user interface is displayed as a stand-alone popup that allows the creation of new accounts as well as payment directly from crypto exchanges, crypto wallets, and bank accounts, with no redirects to browser tabs or pages. This can be integrated as a plugin on the merchant checkout page or as a browser extension. The plugin comes integrated with popular ecommerce platforms including WooCommerce, Shopify, Prestashop and others. The browser extension is integrated with popular browsers including Chrome, Chromium, Opera, Firefox, and Edge. The payment interface is designed for both web and mobile checkout experiences. Merchants are able to integrate the RocketFuel payment interface to their checkout page with software development kits (SDKs) that are available via the merchant portal. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are also available to the merchant for deeper integration into backend systems, ERP platforms, and other third-party platforms.\nThe RocketFuel payment solution utilizes a variety of blockchains in its execution including Bitcoin, Ethereum and others where the payment transactions are stored. A significant benefit of this technology is that the entire shopping cart checkout process will be accomplished via a distributed ledger or \u201cblockchain,\u201d meaning that merchant websites will no longer required to operate complex payment and check-out infrastructures.\nOur solution is designed to be implemented on an eCommerce site\u2019s check-out page. The technology will also be used for different scenarios, including paying for services, paying invoices, and other payment strategies. In addition, we anticipate that a future version of our payment system will allow for advertisements in which the entire check out process is embedded on third party websites where sales may be completely finalized. Thus, our technology will enable eCommerce strategies that can include advertisements with a fully integrated check-out process. We believe that this has never before been accomplished in any eCommerce arrangement. We believe that such advertisements could provide significant new sales channels to retailers that are simply not possible with legacy check-out solutions. We also believe that transactions costs on our system will be significantly less expensive than the cost of credit-card transactions.\nThe \u201csingle-click\u201d RocketFuel check-out solution is based on a streamlined one- to-three-click check-out process for eCommerce purchases. The system is designed to operate identically across merchant channels with all participating merchants. eCommerce merchants are able to encode their check-out protocol to support our technology and the merchants will no longer have to administer complex check-out and payment gateways at their eCommerce websites. At the same time, consumers are able to experience enhanced data protection opportunities and significantly improved convenience.\nWith the RocketFuel check-out systems, consumers will no longer have to enter credit card information or shipping details every time they want to buy online. Payment and shipping information will be handled automatically. Using the RocketFuel payment solution, credit card data will no longer be shared or transmitted and exposed online. Rather, payments will be made via 100% secure cryptocurrency conveyance or direct bank transfer on the blockchain.\nWith the RocketFuel check-out systems, eCommerce merchants are able to find all necessary details for order fulfilment, including item ID, shipping, and payment via the RocketFuel blockchain. Payment will be accomplished automatically and sent instantly. By using the RocketFuel blockchain solution, transaction transmissions may include both payment and shipping information from the consumer to the eCommerce merchant. RocketFuel checkout systems may be served anywhere and potentially on any website. Indeed, special versions of these systems will be able to work in the physical world, such as in-store check outs, without need for any eCommerce website.\nCryptocurrencies are stored in different types of cryptocurrency wallets. These wallets can include mobile wallets, web wallets, desktop wallets, hardware wallets, and exchange wallets. Currently, it can be a difficult, confusing and multi-step process to use these wallets to make cryptocurrency payments. With RocketFuel\u2019s blockchain solution, cryptocurrency holders can use any of the above digital wallets to make payment for products or services to any RocketFuel merchant with 1, 2, or 3 steps. Our payment technology allows payment directly from these wallets to merchants. This includes integration with the largest cryptocurrency exchanges available, currently Coinbase and in the future planned for Binance, Kraken, Gemini, and others, allowing payments directly from crypto exchange wallets. Additionally, instead of allowing payment with only Bitcoin, RocketFuel merchant customers are able to pay with dozens of cryptocurrencies to the various merchants that integrate our technology. Merchants do not need to understand or hold the different cryptocurrencies because RocketFuel exchanges these currencies to the fiat currency of the merchant, currently USD, and allow settlement with fiat currency to the merchant bank account.\nUsing the \u201csingle-click\u201d RocketFuel check-out technology and check-out button, consumers will no longer be re-directed to a third-party website or any payment processor websites requesting personal data, payment details or shipping information. No payment card data will be shared with the eCommerce merchant or any other third party. RocketFuel\u2019s solution is a non-custodial platform; therefore, possession and custody of all funds will be 100% exclusive to the consumer, and no control of funds will ever be available to any third party, including us. Each blockchain transaction will be transparent and available to the merchant via the merchant portal provided by RocketFuel Upon receipt of transactions, merchants will be able to immediately respond by delivering the correct product to the correct client via conventional shipping services.\nWith the RocketFuel solution, eCommerce merchants will need no contact or other information exchange with the consumer in order to receive their payment or shipping details. Instead, they will have immediate visibility of payments from customers via the RocketFuel payment system, which may be integrated into merchants\u2019 fulfillment centers.\nOur Process\nCustomers will go to merchants to make purchases on merchant websites or mobile apps. On the checkout page, along with other payment options, RocketFuel enabled merchants will have a \u2018Pay with Crypto\u2019 or similarly labeled button. Customers that click this button will see a pop-up that provides various payment options. These payment options include crypto wallets, Coinbase, and bank accounts and in the future we plan to add Kraken, Gemini, Binance, BitStamp and other exchanges. The payment amount in USD (or other fiat currency) will also be displayed along with the description of the product they are purchasing. They will be able to select the appropriate payment option. Based on the selected option they will be presented with a variety of cryptocurrencies that are supported by the specific exchange or bank. Both the cryptocurrency and fiat currency amounts will be displayed with each cryptocurrency listed. The available balance of the cryptocurrency in the wallet is also displayed. This gives clear visibility of the payment source, the available cryptocurrencies, and the available balance for each cryptocurrency currently available in the customer wallet.\nThe customer is able to select the payment method, such as Coinbase, to make the payment. He/she can select the payment currency, such as Bitcoin or Litecoin. The customer then clicks the Pay Now button in the popup window and the payment is immediately sent to the merchant for payment of the product or service with one click. If the customer has two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled, they are prompted for the 2FA code before the payment is sent.\nCustomers have the exact same process to pay with bank accounts. They are able to select a bank account that they have previously connected to, such as Bank of America or Wells Fargo. They can select the currency (currently only USD is supported). When they click Pay Now the payment is sent to the merchant. If 2FA is enabled, they will need to provide the 2FA code before the funds are sent.\nWhen funds are sent the merchant will receive an email notification. They can immediately see the transaction in their merchant portal as well as related statistics about this and other payments. Customers are also notified by email when a payment is sent. They can also log into their portal to see the payment information and status. Payment updates can also be integrated directly to the merchant backend system with our APIs.\nCustomers can also request refunds. The merchant is provided the tools to accept and execute a refund in crypto or cash or to deny the request.\nIndustry Background\nA blockchain, also known as a \u201cdistributed ledger technology,\u201d is a sequential, ever-growing, time-stamped set of records that are grouped in blocks and maintained by disparate participants. Each block is interdependent, making alterations of records economically difficult if not outright impossible. A blockchain includes, but is not limited to, the following features:\n\u25cf The blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that is used to record and secure transactions across multiple computers.\n\u25cf The transactions on the blockchain cannot be changed.\n\u25cf All transactions on the blockchain can be verified and audited inexpensively by anyone.\n\u25cf The blockchain confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once.\n\u25cf A blockchain database consists of two kinds of records: transactions and blocks. Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded.\n\u25cf Each block includes the hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two.\n\u25cf The linked blocks form a virtual \u201cchain.\u201d\nThe blockchain, being a globally distributed ledger running on millions of devices, is capable of recording transfers of anything of value. Transactions in money, equities, bonds, titles, deeds, contracts, and virtually all other kinds of assets can be implemented and stored securely, privately, and from peer to peer, because trust is established, not by powerful intermediaries like banks and governments, but by network consensus, cryptography, collaboration, and sophisticated code. For the first time in human history, two or more parties, be they businesses or individuals who may not even know each other, can forge agreements, make transactions, and build value without relying on intermediaries (such as banks, payment institutions, rating agencies and other third parties) to verify their identities, establish trust, or perform the critical business logic contracting, clearing, settling, and record-keeping tasks that are foundational to all forms of commerce.\nGiven the promise and risks associated of such a disruptive technology, many firms in all kinds of industries, such as banks, insurers, audit and other professional service firms, are investing in, and implementing, blockchain solutions, often to take advantage of the opportunities to reduce friction (which in the case of our user interface means fewer clicks for the user) and costs.\nBlockchain Technologies for eCommerce Payments and Check-out Solutions\nRocketFuel blockchain technologies are intended to solve many of the issues with traditional payment methods. By utilizing blockchain technology, our system will be designed to credit payments faster, with little or no transaction costs, and significantly more secure than current payment systems, while enabling consumers to retain more control over their data.\nTraditional online and offline payment methods route transactions through banks, card-schemes and expensive clearing houses before the money is actually credited to the merchant\u2019s account. In addition, the consumers must send and expose sensitive data online, making it vulnerable to hackers and fraudsters. The blockchain has the ability to provide solutions that can remove the need for third parties such as VISA, MasterCard, acquirers/banks and other intermediaries and make the payments faster, cheaper and more frictionless. Blockchain technologies enable the consumer to control his or her personal, sensitive data without the need to share payment credentials, personal information or other vulnerable data. This could remove the need for expensive and complex third-party anti-fraud tools, transaction monitoring software, and the like, eliminating the possibility for consumers to have their data stolen and mis-used, such as recently experienced in the Facebook data scandal.\nWe believe implementing blockchain technologies in the eCommerce industry will be game changing not only for the payment regimes but also for the way consumers interact with merchants and each other in a peer-to-peer environment, creating multiple benefits and opportunities for both the merchants and the consumers; as described below:\nCheaper Transactions. No intermediaries such as digital wallets and other traditional payment methods, card-schemes and acquirers, are required. Instead, the system is based on self-executing contract instructions with no complexity of transfers and transactions.\nFaster Transactions. The merchants will no longer have to wait days for the card-processors and acquirers to settle the transactions. With the blockchain, the transactions, payments and shipping and order details will be encoded in the data-load files encoded in the transaction instant stored and logged on the blockchain.\nTransparency. The blockchain can store the entire owner history of a product, no matter where the product goes and how many times it is re-purchased. Thus, the blockchain can help eliminate fraud and brings transparency to both consumers and merchant.\nCreating Decentralized Blockchain-Based eCommerce Marketplaces. Because of the security that both the network and the cryptography provide, blockchain technology provides a secure system through which individuals and businesses can directly interact and transact with each other without the need for another intermediary. The only minor fees that will be paid are for the network behind the blockchain for validating transactions and securing the network. Both buyer and seller pay no fees to a marketplace company, because technically, there is no company. The platforms through which e-commerce will be conducted in such eCommerce marketplaces are blockchain applications. Because blockchains are decentralized, there is no central party, or company, that sets the rules and decides how users will transact with one another. The users, thus individuals and businesses, determine how the platform will develop and function.\nSecurity and Consumer Data Protection. Sending consumer data using the blockchain instead of the traditional methods using third party gateways eliminates the possibility for the hackers and fraudsters to steal and mis-use the consumer\u2019s sensitive data. Also, on the database level, the blockchain provides remarkable attributes. For example, it has previously been impossible to assure a database was not manipulated by criminal actors. As the blockchain regime is currently designed, data stored on a blockchain cannot be changed by any means. Further, the blockchain is designed such that it is with the highest certainty that only a possessor of a \u2018private key\u2019 can cause a transaction to occur. This assures security at a level never before possible in any computing system. With these properties, blockchain now enables improvement in known systems whereby excellent performance never before possible is realized.\nAnti-Money Laundering Features. Blockchain technologies can be used in powerful anti-money laundering systems as every transaction is \u2018laid open\u2019 and available to all system users. Transactions on the blockchain cannot be hidden from the public and they are forever recorded in the ledger.\nOur Growth Strategy\nThe first prototype of our blockchain based check-out solution was developed from 2019 through 2021 and we launched our first product in a live environment with an online travel agency and an accounting software company in March 2021. We intend to continue to develop our technology to obtain proof of concept with several larger U.S. eCommerce merchants, social media platforms and blogsites.\nWe have contracted with a development team reporting to our CTO, to oversee the development of our blockchain-based check-out solution. We have recently retained a Vice President for Marketing and Development to push our social media strategy and to approach new merchants and partners.\nOur Sales and Marketing\nWe believe that our business development team is highly experienced within eCommerce and online marketplaces. With connections to several larger eCommerce merchants, we believe that it will secure our growth and bring us revenue commencing in 2021. Our sales and marketing efforts will focus on a few larger eCommerce merchants rather than many smaller merchants and will be scaled up as funding permits. We believe that a strong proof-of-concept window with our technology functionally displayed in scale will attract merchants to our technology, and we intend to sell the technology both on a per transaction fee and on a license fee basis.\nOur Revenue Model\nWe anticipate that our revenues will be derived primarily from transaction and commission fees from eCommerce merchants. Appreciable revenue generation comes with user adoption. User adoption is a difficult matter to predict in the cryptocurrency community and many have set out with optimism and failed to achieve good user adoption. In the future we have the option to charge our merchant customers set-up fees and license fees as well as fees for added merchant services that we may develop, such as fulfillment and order processing services.\nOur Competition\nWhile there are small crypto payment providers currently in the market, our primary competitor will be Bitpay, which is already well established as the leading crypto payment technology in the market. Compared with Bitpay, we believe that RocketFuel offers a better user experience for crypto payments, more choices to crypto holders (including most of the most popular cryptocurrencies), and more features and more value to merchants. While Bitpay allows payment only with Bitcoin, RocketFuel allows payment with over 40 cryptocurrencies and will be adding more options for customers. Unlike Bitpay, RocketFuel offers payments from any crypto wallet and from multiple crypto exchanges. RocketFuel offers a user experience that solve both the problem with complex onboarding and complex crypto payment experiences, which we believe is less complicated and more intuitive. RocketFuel also offers services that Bitpaty currently does not, such as providing merchants immediate visibility of payment transactions, real time metrics of transactions and customers, easy integration to ecommerce checkout as well as deep integration to backend platforms.\nWe also expect to have future competition from traditional payment platforms including Paypal, Visa and Mastercard, but do not expect these providers to have a competitive solution until at least 2022.\nOur technology is designed to be compliant with the European Union\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other governmental regulations and initiatives to protect the consumer\u2019s data.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur merchant clients are subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of user data. Foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. As the blockchain industry is still relatively new and in the midst of significant development, there are also potential federal, state and foreign legislative proposals and various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection, tracking, behavioral advertising and consumer protection that could affect our clients.\nAs of May 25, 2018, the European Union\u2019s GDPR has been enforced for all organizations doing business in Europe. GDPR aims to harmonize European data privacy laws, protect and empower all EU citizens\u2019 data privacy, and set the guidelines on how to embed data privacy controls within participating organizations.\nWe believe that our blockchain based check-out solution will help our clients to be compliant with the enhanced privacy rules and regulations as our technology will enable the consumers to pay for goods online without exposing spending credentials (credit card data) with the eCommerce merchants.\nEmployees\nAs of June 26, 2021, we have 6 employees and an outsourced technical team.",
    "item_7": "Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation\nOverview\nOur Corporate History\nOn June 27, 2018 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d), RocketFuel Blockchain Company (\u201cRBC\u201d) and B4MC Gold Mines, Inc., a Nevada Corporation (\u201cB4MC\u201d or the \u201cPurchaser\u201d), consummated the transactions contemplated by that certain Contribution Agreement (the \u201cContribution Agreement\u201d) made and entered into as of June 27, 2018 by and among RBC, the Purchaser and Gert Funk, Joseph Page, PacificWave Partners Limited, PacificWave Partners UK Ltd. and Saxton Capital Ltd (collectively referred to herein as the \u201cSellers\u201d, individually each a \u201cSeller\u201d).\nPursuant to the Contribution Agreement the Sellers contributed, transferred, assigned and conveyed to B4MC all right, title and interest in and to one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding Common Stock of RBC for an aggregate of 17,001,312 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of B4MC (the \u201cPurchaser Common Stock\u201d), (such transaction, the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). As a result of the Business Combination, RBC became a 100% wholly owned subsidiary of B4MC. In September 2018 B4MC changed its name to RocketFuel Blockchain, Inc. References to \u201cwe\u201d and similar terms in this report are to B4MC after the consummation of the Business Transaction.\nPrior to the Business Combination, B4MC was a \u201cshell company,\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. As a result of the Business Combination, we have ceased to be a \u201cshell company.\u201d\nThe Business Combination was treated as a \u201creverse acquisition\u201d of RBC for financial accounting purposes. RBC was considered the acquirer for accounting purposes, and the historical financial statements of BFMC before the Business Combination were replaced with the historical financial statements of RBC before the Business Combination in all future filings with the SEC. The Purchaser Common Stock issued to the Sellers in connection with the Business Combination have not been registered under the Securities Act, in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2), which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering, Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated by the SEC under that section. These shares may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration. In this report, references to RocketFuel, the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and similar terms are to B4MC following the consummation of the reverse acquisition. In September 2018 B4MC changed its name to RocketFuel Blockchain, Inc.\nThe foregoing description of the Contribution Agreement does not purport to be complete. For further information, please refer to the copy of the Contribution Agreement included as Exhibit 2.1 to the Current Report on Form 8-K which was filed with the SEC on June 29, 2018. There are representations and warranties contained in the Contribution Agreement that were made by the parties to each other as of the date of execution. The assertions embodied in these representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the Contribution Agreement and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating their terms. Moreover, some representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date because they are subject to a contractual standard of materiality that is different from certain standards generally applicable to shareholders or were used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. For these reasons, investors should not rely on the representations and warranties in the Contribution Agreement as statements of factual information.\nOur Business\nWe provide check-out and payment systems that securely automate and simplify the way online payment and shipping information is received by merchants from their customers. Our check-out systems are designed to enhance customers\u2019 data protection, enabling consumers to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrencies or by direct transfers from their bank accounts without exposing spending credentials such as credit card data. At the same time, our check-out systems are designed to increase the speed, security and ease of use for both customers and merchants and include a merchant portal that provides detailed transactions and metrics about payments received by the merchant. They also include a customer portal where shoppers are able to track their payments, configure payment defaults and connect with various cryptocurrency exchanges and banks to facilitate payment to merchants. Merchants are able to integrate a unique pop-up user interface that allows customers to pay directly from their ecommerce checkout page with no need to redirect to another website or web page.\nOur merchant portal is updated instantly when a payment transaction is made on the merchant website. The merchant is notified of the transaction and can see the transaction details, including the customer that made the transaction, the transaction amount and the transaction items. This information is added to the merchant dashboard where various metrics are tracked and displayed to the merchant, including information about the various cryptocurrencies that are used for payments to that merchant and the different currencies received by the merchant as payment. In addition to various metrics, merchants are able to see a variety of reports, and are able to configure various options including settlement options from their portal.\nCustomers of merchants that use the RocketFuel payment solution are able to track their payments in their online portal. They are also able to track payments they made to all the merchants that are integrated with the RocketFuel payment technology within one consolidated user portal. They are currently able to connect to their accounts on Coinbase, and in the future we plan to add connectivity to Binance, Kraken, Gemini and other exchanges to pay directly from bank accounts. They can also pay from any cryptocurrency wallet. Customers are able to pay from as well. These customers are able to make payment with any of these payment options with 1, 2, or 3 clicks from the merchant checkout page. By default, these customers can choose from dozens of cryptocurrencies to pay from.\nOur payment user interface allows customers to easily onboard as well as to pay for merchants\u2019 products or services with a variety of cryptocurrencies or via bank transfers. The user interface is displayed as a stand-alone popup that allows the creation of new accounts as well as payment directly from crypto exchanges, crypto wallets, and bank accounts, with no redirects to browser tabs or pages. This can be integrated as a plugin on the merchant checkout page or as a browser extension. The plugin comes integrated with popular ecommerce platforms including WooCommerce, Shopify, Prestashop and others. The browser extension is integrated with popular browsers including Chrome, Chromium, Opera, Firefox, and Edge. The payment interface is designed for both web and mobile checkout experiences. Merchants are able to integrate the RocketFuel payment interface to their checkout page with software development kits (SDKs) that are available via the merchant portal. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are also available to the merchant for deeper integration into backend systems, ERP platforms, and other third-party platforms.\nThe RocketFuel payment solution utilizes a variety of blockchains in its execution including Bitcoin, Ethereum and others where the payment transactions are stored. A significant benefit of this technology is that the entire shopping cart checkout process will be accomplished via a distributed ledger or \u201cblockchain,\u201d meaning that merchant websites will no longer required to operate complex payment and check-out infrastructures.\nOur solution is designed to be implemented on an eCommerce site\u2019s check-out page. The technology will also be used for different scenarios, including paying for services, paying invoices, and other payment strategies. In addition, we anticipate that a future version of our payment system will allow for advertisements in which the entire check-out process is embedded on third party websites where sales may be completely finalized. Thus, our technology could enable eCommerce strategies that can include advertisements with a fully integrated check-out process. We believe that this has never before been accomplished in any eCommerce arrangement. We believe that such advertisements will provide significant new sales channels to retailers that are simply not possible with legacy check-out solutions. We also believe that transactions costs on our system will be significantly less expensive than the cost of credit-card transactions.\nThe \u201csingle-click\u201d RocketFuel check-out solution is based on a streamlined one- to-three-click check-out process for eCommerce purchases. The system is designed to operate identically across merchant channels with all participating merchants. eCommerce merchants are able to encode their check-out protocol to support our technology and the merchants will no longer have to administer complex check-out and payment gateways at their eCommerce websites. At the same time, consumers are able to experience enhanced data protection opportunities and significantly improved convenience.\nWith the RocketFuel check-out systems, consumers will no longer have to enter credit card information or shipping details every time they want to buy online. Payment and shipping information will be handled automatically. Using the RocketFuel payment solution, credit card data will no longer be shared or transmitted and exposed online. Rather, payments will be made via 100% secure cryptocurrency conveyance or direct bank transfer on the blockchain.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 3 to our financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by our management, and such judgments are reflected in the amounts reported in our financial statements. In applying these policies, our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of market trends, information provided by our strategic partners and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Actual results may differ significantly from the estimates contained in our financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Years Ended March 31, 2021 vs. March 31, 2020\nRevenues\nDuring the three month period ended March 31, 2021, we commenced commercial operations and executed a contract with one customer having a one-year term from the date of execution (the \u201cContract Term\u201d), which was March 31, 2021, that provided for the payment of $10,000 in connection with the implementation of our blockchain technology. In addition, the Contract Term provided for transaction processing using our blockchain technology with no fees during the Contract Term as an inducement to adopt our blockchain technology. We recorded the $10,000 fee as deferred revenue which will be amortized ratably over the Contract Term. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we did not generate any revenue and had not yet commenced commercial operations. We anticipate that future revenues will be generated from (i) fees charged in connection with the implementation of our blockchain technology; and (ii) ongoing daily transactional fees derived as a negotiated percentage of the transactional revenues earned by our merchant customers.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 were $163,405 as compared to $3,390 for the comparable prior year period, an increase of $160,015. The increase is primarily a result of the engagement of contract developers and the payroll expenses incurred in connection with the hiring of our full-time chief technology officer, all of whom were engaged in continued development of our blockchain technology for payment processing.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 were $2,200,177 as compared to $121,649 for the comparable prior year period, an increase of $2,078,528. The increase is primarily a result of (i) legal fees incurred in connection with certain litigation costs and payroll expenses incurred in connection with the hiring of our full-time chief executive officer, and (ii) stock-based compensation.\nStock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 of $1,622,335 was composed of (i) the $162,000 value of 150,000 shares of our common stock issued to an independent consultant for services in lieu of cash consideration; (ii) stock options granted to employees which were valued at $1,090,204; (iii) the issuance of a warrant to our chief executive officer that is exercisable into 265,982 shares of our common stock and valued at $370,131; and the (iv) repricing of certain stock options granted to our chief financial officer in August 2018 which were re-priced resulting in additional stock-based compensation of $489,064.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2021, we had cash of $800,331, an increase of $792,493 as compared to a cash balance of $7,838 as of March 31, 2020. Our current cash requirements are approximately $200,000 per month.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, net cash of $636,257 was used in operating activities. Net cash used in operating activities was primarily composed of our net loss of $2,363,582 and offset by (i) $1,460,335 of non-cash stock-based compensation in connection with the grant of employee stock options and issuance of a common stock purchase warrant to our chief executive officer; (ii) $162,000 of non-cash stock-based compensation in connection with the issuance of 150,000 shares of our common stock to a consultant for services in lieu of cash consideration; and (iii) increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and related party payable of $109,990 in the aggregate.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, net cash of $1,428,750 was provided by financing activities from the issuance of 1,478,750 shares of our common stock to two investors. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, net cash of $121,250 was provided by financing activities from the issuance of 121,250 shares of our common stock in consideration of $121,250 in gross cash proceeds.\nThere were no options exercised during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 and no options or warrants exercised during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, one investor exercised warrants to purchase 1,100,000 shares of our common stock of which (i) 1,000,000 shares of our common stock were issued in consideration of gross proceeds of $1,000,000 prior to March 31, 2021; and (ii) 100,000 shares of our common stock, for which we received notice of exercise on March 31, 2021, were issued subsequent to March 31, 2021 in consideration of gross proceeds of $100,000.\nOur financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, we reported a net loss of $2,363,582, which included non-cash stock-based compensation of $1,622,335, and cash flows used in operating activities of $636,257. As a result, management believes that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe will require additional financing in order to continue to develop our product and execute on our business plan. However, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising the additional capital necessary to continue operations and execute on our business plan. Any potential future sale of equity or debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders, and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are required to raise additional financing, but are unable to obtain such financing, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more aspects of our operations or business development activities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of March 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.",

    "item_1": "ITEM 1.BUSINESS\nOverview\nIdeanomics, Inc. (\u201cIdeanomics\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (Nasdaq: IDEX) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 19, 2004. From 2010 through 2017, our primary business activities were providing premium content video on demand (\u201cVOD\u201d) services, with primary operations in the PRC, through our subsidiaries and variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) under the brand name You-on-Demand (\u201cYOD.\u201d) We closed the YOD business during 2019.\nStarting in early 2017, the Company transitioned its business model to become a next-generation financial technology (\u201cfintech\u201d) company. The Company built a network of businesses, operating principally in the trading of petroleum products and electronic components that the Company believed had significant potential to recognize benefits from blockchain and artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) technologies including enhancing operations, addressing cost inefficiencies, improving documentation and standardization, unlocking asset value and improving customer engagement. During 2018, the Company ceased operations in the petroleum products and electronic components trading businesses and disposed of the businesses during 2019. As we looked to deploy fintech solutions in late 2018 and into 2019, we identified a unique opportunity in the Chinese Electric Vehicle (\u201cEV\u201d) industry to facilitate large scale conversion of fleet vehicles from internal combustion engines to EV. This led us to establish our Mobile Energy Global (\u201cMEG\u201d) business unit. Fintech continues to be a sector of interest to us as we look to invest in and develop businesses that can improve the financial services industry, particularly as it relates to deploying blockchain and AI technologies.\nPrincipal Products or Services and Their Markets\nOverview\nIdeanomics Mobility\nIdeanomics Mobility is driving EV adoption by assembling a synergistic ecosystem of subsidiaries and investments across the 3 key pillars of EV: Vehicles, Charging, and Energy. These three pillars provide the foundation for Ideanomics Mobility\u2019s planned offering of unique business solutions such as Charging as a Service (\u201cCaaS\u201d) and Vehicle as a Service (\u201cVaaS.\u201d)\nEach operating company within Ideanomics Mobility offers its own unique products and participates in a shared services ecosystem fulfilling Ideanomics\u2019 Sales-to-Financing-to-Charging (\u201cS2F2C\u201d) model, with centralized supply chain operations and marketing expertise designed to accelerate growth and business opportunities across the group.\nThe combination of products from within its subsidiaries and investments, coupled with Ideanomics Mobility\u2019s shared services, will provide the Company with the opportunity to bring to market unique business solutions intended to drive commercial fleet electrification such as Charging-as-a-Service and Vehicle-as-a-Service. These solutions offer fleet operators an opportunity to benefit from an OpEx-driven model which lowers the barrier to entry for the adoption of zero emissions fleets.\nThe Company believes that the EV market is poised for rapid growth. Bloomberg NEF estimates that global commercial EV sales will reach 1.2 million units in 2023. The global EV charging infrastructure market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 33.4% from 2021 to 2028 to $144.97 billion. President Biden\u2019s administration is supportive of EV with a goal to achieve a 100% clean-energy economy and states such as California have accelerated timelines to phase out internal combustion engine (\u201cICE\u201d) vehicles.\nIdeanomics Mobility\u2019s mission is to leverage its ecosystem of synergistic operating companies to generate efficiencies and increase business opportunities across the group. With a diverse commercial EV product offering, the company plans to use EV and EV battery sales and financing solutions to attract commercial fleet operators that will generate large scale demand for energy. The Company operates as an end-to-end solutions provider for the procurement, financing, charging and energy management needs for fleet operators of commercial EV. Ideanomics Mobility focuses on commercial EV rather than passenger personal EV, as commercial EV is on an accelerated adoption path when compared to consumer EV adoption - which is expected to take between ten to fifteen years. We focus on four distinct commercial vehicle types with supporting income streams: 1) Closed-area heavy commercial, in sectors such as Mining, Airports, and Sea Ports 2) Last-mile delivery light commercial 3) Buses and Coaches 4) Taxis. The vehicle financing solutions (such as purchase or leasing) would generate fee-based revenues whereas the charging and energy management would yield recurring revenue streams.\nIdeanomics Mobility\u2019s revenues are generated from its S2F2C operating model. The Company\u2019s planned EV revenues will come from the sale of EVs under our Medici Motor Works and Treeletrik brands outside of the China and within China through our MEG operating units sale of other manufacturers vehicles and batteries.\nThe Company\u2019s presence in the China market creates a deep knowledge of the logistics and supply chain for the manufacture of EVs, batteries and related components; this in turn enables the sourcing of high quality components at competitive prices for the Company\u2019s operations outside of China.\nWithin the Ideanomics Mobility business unit there are four operating companies:\nMobile Energy Global (\u201cMEG\u201d)\nThe Company\u2019s MEG business operates in China where government clean air regulations and subsidy programs provide a strong impetus for the adoption of commercial EV. The Company competes in China using its S2F2C. Using this model the Company helps the customer find the best vehicle for its needs and earns fees for every completed sale; revenue is derived from the spread between group buying of vehicles and price sold, fees for the arrangement of financing, and payments from subsequent charging and energy management.\nTree Technologies Sdn. Bhd. (\u201cTree Technologies\u201d)\nTree Technologies is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and through its Treeletrik brand sells EV bikes, scooters, and batteries throughout the ASEAN region. Two-wheel bikes and scooters form a large part of the transport infrastructure in the ASEAN region; according to Deloitte Consulting, there were 13.7 million motor bikes sold in the six major ASEAN countries in 2019. Environmental regulations in the ASEAN region help accelerate the adoption of EV bikes. The Company has also started to import Treeletrik brand EV bikes into the United States.\nMedici Motor Works\nMedici Motor Works plans to sell its own brand vehicles in the United States, Latin America and Europe. Presently, the Company is working with manufacturers based in China to design and build trucks, buses and closed-area vehicles for mining, airports and seaports.\nSolectrac, Inc. (\u201cSolectrac\u201d)\nOn October 21, 2020 the Company acquired 15%, and on November 23, 2020 the Company subsequently increased its ownership to 24% in California-based Solectrac, Inc. Solectrac develops, assembles and distributes 100% battery-powered electric tractors-an alternative to diesel tractors-for agriculture and utility operations.\nAccording to Research And Markets, the global agricultural tractor market is currently valued at $75 billion, with the North American agricultural tractor market expected to reach $20 billion by 2023. The largest segment for agricultural tractors is the below-40HP segment, where Solectrac's initial three models address the broad needs of the market. Its tractors are specifically designed to serve the needs of community-based farms, vineyards, orchards, equestrian arenas, greenhouses, and hobby farms.\nFounded in 2012 to take electric tractors into commercial production, Solectrac was incorporated as a California Benefit Corp in 2019. It has received grants from the Indian U.S. Science and Technology Fund and the National Science Foundation. In 2020, Solectrac received the World Alliance Solar Impulse Efficient Solutions label from the Solar Impulse Foundation. The label was awarded for being one of the one thousand most efficient and profitable solutions that can transition society to being economically viable while being environmentally sustainable.\nRecent Developments Since December 31, 2020\nSince December 31, 2020 the Company has completed a number of transactions that have expanded the scope of the Company\u2019s EV activities.\nWAVE\nOn January 15, 2021 acquired 100% of privately held Wireless Advanced Vehicle Electrification, Inc. (\"WAVE.\")\nFounded in 2011, and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, WAVE is a leading provider of inductive (wireless) charging solutions for medium and heavy-duty EVs. Embedded in roadways and depot facilities, the WAVE system automatically charges vehicles during scheduled stops. The hands-free WAVE system eliminates battery range limitations and enables fleets to achieve driving ranges that match that of internal combustion engines.\nDeployed since 2012, WAVE has demonstrated the capability to develop and integrate high-power charging systems into heavy-duty EVs from leading commercial EV manufacturers. With commercially available wireless charging systems up to 250kW and higher power systems in development, WAVE provides custom fleet solutions for mass transit, logistics, airport and campus shuttles, drayage fleets, and off-road vehicles at ports and industrial sites.\nWireless charging systems offer several compelling benefits over plug-in-based charging systems, including reduced maintenance, improved health and safety, and expedited energy connection and are important to the deployment of autonomous driving vehicles. Furthermore, wireless in-route charging enables greater route lengths or smaller batteries while also maintaining battery life, thereby reducing costs for fleet operators. WAVE customers include what is currently the largest EV bus system in the U.S., the Antelope Valley Transit Authority, and its partnerships include Kenworth, Gillig, BYD, Complete Coach Works and the Department of Energy.\nEnergica Motor Company, S.P.A. (\u201cEnergica\u201d)\nOn March 3, 2021 the Company purchased 20% of Energica, the world's leading manufacturer of high-performance electric motorcycles and the sole manufacturer of the FIM Enel MotoE\u2122 World Cup. Energica has combined zero emission EV technology with the pedigree of high-performance mobility synonymous with Italy\u2019s Motor Valley to create a range of exceptional products for the high-performance motorcycle market. To support its products, it has developed proprietary EV battery and DC fast-charging in-house that has applications and synergies with Ideanomics\u2019 broader interests in the global EV sector.\nSilk EV Cayman LP (\u201cSilk\u201d)\nOn January 28, 2021, the Company invested $15.0 million in Silk EV via a promissory note. Silk is an Italian engineering and design services company that has recently partnered with FAW to form a new company (Silk-FAW) to produce fully electric, luxury vehicles for the Chinese and Global auto markets. Silk-FAW has exclusive rights to develop Hongqi-S brand high-end electric sports cars. The Hongqi brand is the most well-known luxury auto brand in China. Silk-FAW vehicles are being designed in Italy\u2019s Motor Valley and is attracting talent from the luxury and high-performance auto market. Partnering with Silk provides access to Silk-FAW\u2019s Innovation Centers providing us insight into technological advancements and all best-in-breed technology evaluated at those centers to support the development of high-performance sportscars (battery tech, power management systems, high performance motors.)\nIdeanomics Capital\nIdeanomics Capital is the Company's fintech business unit, which focuses on leveraging technology and innovation to improve efficiency, transparency, and profitability for the financial services industry.\nTechnology Metals Market Limited (\u201cTM2\u201d)\nTM2 is a London based digital commodities issuance and trading platform for technology metals. It connects institutional investors, proprietary traders and retail investors with metals suppliers - miners, refiners, recyclers and mints. The platform focuses specifically on new metals that currently don\u2019t have an active trading marketplace, such as rhodium, lithium, cobalt, rhenium, etc. The Company\u2019s ownership interest in TM2 provides valuable data and insight into the global technology metals market, which is critical to the future of the Cleantech and EV industries. TM2 connects both pillars of Cleantech and Fintech. The types of metals and materials traded on the TM2 platform are critical to Cleantech (for EV battery production, energy storage systems, solar cells, etc.,) while the Fintech platform is innovative in representing these commodities which do not exist on traditional exchanges.\nOn January 28, 2021, the Company entered into a simple agreement for future equity with TM2 pursuant to which Ideanomics invested $2.1 million. This investment is a follow-on investment further the Company\u2019s prior investment of $1.2 million in stock-based consideration in December 2019.\nDelaware Board of Trade (\u201cDBOT\u201d)\nThe Delaware Board of Trade (\u201cDBOT\u201d) is a broker dealer that also operates an Alternative Trading System (\u201cATS,\u201d) presently DBOT is not trading; the business remains in full regulatory compliance. Recent developments have pointed to increased recognition of digital securities\u2019 relevance in regulated global capital markets. As well, regulatory easing of certain restrictions such as the threshold for private securities (Reg A+), along with good demand for products such as pre-IPO issuance, provide good tailwind for the broker dealers business. The Company has filed a continuing membership application for private placement activities in the primary markets. The Company believes that growing demand for private placements, along with increased attention in digital securities, provide a favorable environment for DBOT\u2019s future growth.\nTimios\nOn January 8, 2021 the Company acquired 100% of privately-held Timios Holdings Corp. (\"Timios.\") Timios, a nationwide title and escrow services provider, which has been expanding in recent years through offering innovative and freedom-of-choice-friendly solutions for real estate transactions. The products include residential and commercial title insurance, closing and settlement services, as well as specialized offerings for the mortgage process industry.\nIdeanomics expects that Timios will become one of the cornerstones of Ideanomics Capital. Timios combines difficult to obtain local and state licenses, a knowledgeable and experienced team, and a scalable platform to deliver best-in-class services through both centralized processing and localized branch networks. Ideanomics will assist Timios in scaling its business in various ways, including referring client acquisitions and product innovation.\nFounded in 2008 by real estate industry veteran Trevor Stoffer, Timios' vision is to bring transparency to real estate transactions. The company offers title and settlement, appraisal management, and real-estate-owned (\u201cREO\u201d) title and closing services in 44 states and currently serves more than 280 national and regional clients.\nNon-Core Assets\nThe Company has identified a number of business units that it considers non-core and is evaluating strategies for divesting these assets. The non-core assets are Grapevine, a marketing and ecommerce platform focused on influencer marketing, and FinTech Village a 58-acre development site in West Hartford, Connecticut.\nOn January 28, 2021, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors accepted an offer of $2.75 million for Fintech Village, and subsequently signed a non-binding sale contract on March 15, 2021. The Company believes that Fintech Village met the criteria for held for sale classification on January 28, 2021.\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nThe Company\u2019s Tree Technologies business located in Malaysia and its WAVE business located in Utah, United States, (acquired in the first quarter of 2021 - see Recent Developments section) assemble and manufacture motor bikes and inductive charging systems respectively. These businesses depend on a ready supply of components that are sourced domestically and internationally and any interruption to the supply of components could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results. The Company\u2019s suppliers that manufacture EVs and batteries depend on a ready supply of raw materials and components, consequently a shortage of raw materials or components could adversely impact their manufacturing process and, potentially, impact the Company\u2019s revenues as it may not be able to complete orders that it had received. The Company may also be adversely impacted if global logistic and supply chains are interrupted.\nSeasonality\nThe Company expects that orders and sales will be influenced by the amount and timing of budgeted expenditure by its customers. Typically, the Company would expect to see higher sales at the start of the year when companies start executing on their capital programs and at the end of the year when companies are spending any surplus or uncommitted budget before the new budget cycle commences. The Company\u2019s operating businesses are in the early stage of their development and consequently do not have sufficient trading histories to project seasonal buying patterns with any degree of confidence.\nWorking Capital Requirements\nAs the Company expands its business the need for working capital will continue to grow. From time to time the Company\u2019s MEG operating division in China has the opportunity to purchase a large number of vehicles at a favorable price, the terms of the purchase contract frequently require the Company to pay some or all of the cost in advance of the delivery of the vehicles with the resultant need to commit material amounts of working capital. The Company\u2019s Tree Technologies subsidiary requires working capital to support the assembly of EV motor bikes and scooters for the ASEAN market. The Company acquired WAVE and Solectrac in the first quarter of 2021 (see the Recent Developments section), both of these businesses will require working capital to fund the purchase of components for the assembly of wireless charging systems and electric tractors, respectively. The Company will continue to raise both debt and equity capital to support the working capital needs of these businesses and its U.S. Head Office functions.\nTrade marks, Patents and Licenses\nThe Company\u2019s Intelligenta business operates under a license granted by Seasail Ventures Limited (\u201cSeasail.\u201d) The license does not have a stated term.\nCustomer Concentration\nThe Company is in the process of building out its Ideanomics Mobility unit and has not yet reached a stage of development where the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nReliance on Government Contracts\nThe Company does not contract directly with the government of the PRC, however it does have investments, partnerships and agreements with the State Own Entities (\u201cSOE\u201d) described above. Additionally, the rate at which commercial fleets convert to EV is heavily\ninfluenced by federal and provincial policies in the PRC as they relate to clean air and adoption of EV technology. Consequently, the Company\u2019s results may be adversely impacted by changes in regulations in the PRC.\nCompetitive Business Conditions, Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of Competition\nIdeanomics Mobility\nPurchasers of commercial vehicles have the choice between traditional ICE vehicles and EVs and this is likely to continue for at least the next five years and possibly longer. The most important drivers for the development of the commercial fleet EV market are federal and provincial regulations relating to clean air and electronic vehicles including subsidies and incentives to help owners of fleets of commercial vehicles to convert from combustion engines to EV. The speed at which fleet operators convert to EV is highly correlated with government regulations, targets and related subsidies and incentives. If the governments, or municipalities, change the regulations, targets, incentives or subsidies then the rate at which fleet operators convert their vehicles to EV could slow down which in turn may lead to lower revenues for the Company. Additionally, the rate, and form in which, the commercial fleet EV market develops is dependent upon technological developments in battery and charging systems; deployment of the charging infrastructure to support widespread commercial EV use and the development of new financing and lending structures that address the different collateral and resale values of the battery and vehicle versus internal combustion engine vehicles.\nIn addition to its directly owned operations the Company operates through a network of investment arrangements, partnerships and formal and informal alliances; consequently, its competitive position could be adversely impacted if one of the members of the alliance was not able to meet the demand for its products, decides not to continue to cooperate with the Company, or goes out of business.\nIdeanomics Capital\nThe Company\u2019s Ideanomics Capital business unit operates in sectors that are undergoing rapid change.\nDBOT is a broker dealer that also operates an ATS. In April 2020 the Company ceased trading OTC equities, terminated the employees assigned to DBOT and the services needed to operate the business. The Company has continued to maintain DBOT\u2019s regulatory licenses and required regulatory capital. The Company has applied for regulatory approval to broker digital securities and tokens, this is a nascent market which the Company believes has good long term potential.\nCorporate Structure\nThe following chart depicts our corporate structure as of December 31, 2020:\n(1)\nIn 2020, the Company renamed You On Demand (Asia) Limited to Medici Operation Limited.\n(2)\nIn 2020, the Company renamed You On Demand (Beijing) Information Consulting Co., Limited. to Beijing Medici New Energy Automobile Co,, Ltd.\n(3)\nIn 2020, the Company renamed Wecast Services Group Limited to MEG Technology Services Group Limited.\n(4)\nIn 2020, the Company renamed Shanghai Boqu Investment Management Consulting Co., Ltd. to Shanghai Ainengju Investment Management Consulting Co., Ltd.\nVIE Structure and Arrangements\nThe Company consolidated certain VIEs located in the PRC in which it held variable interests and was the primary beneficiary through contractual agreements. The Company was the primary beneficiary because it had the power to direct activities that most significantly affected their economic performance and had the obligation to absorb or right to receive the majority of their losses or benefits. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. A shareholder in one of the VIEs is the spouse of Bruno Wu (\u201cDr. Wu,\u201d) the former Chairman of the Company.\nRefer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nThe contractual agreements listed below, which collectively granted the Company the power to direct the VIEs activities that most significantly affected their economic performance, as well to cause the Company to have the obligation to absorb or right to receive the majority of their losses or benefits, were terminated by all parties on December 31, 2019. As a result, the Company deconsolidated the VIEs as of December 31, 2019. The deconsolidation resulted in a net loss of $2.0 million recorded in \u201cGain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries, net\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations, and a statutory income tax of $0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFor these consolidated VIEs, their assets were not available to the Company and their creditors did not have recourse to the Company. Prior to December 31, 2019, in order to operate certain legacy business in the PRC and to comply with PRC laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of companies that provides value-added telecommunication services, the Company entered into a series of contractual agreements with two VIEs. These contractual agreements were initially set to expire in March 2030 and April 2036, respectively, and could not be terminated by the VIEs, except with the consent of, or a material breach, by the Company. A shareholder in one of the VIEs is the spouse of Dr. Wu, the former Chairman of the Company.\nThe key terms of the VIE Agreements are summarized as follows:\n\u25cf Equity Pledge Agreement - The VIEs\u2019 shareholders pledged all of their equity interests in the VIEs to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the PRC;\n\u25cf Call Option Agreement - The VIEs\u2019 shareholders granted an exclusive option to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the PRC, or its designee, to purchase all or any portion of the VIEs\u2019 Shareholders\u2019 equity in the VIEs;\n\u25cf Power of Attorney - The VIEs\u2019 shareholders granted to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the PRC the irrevocable right, for the maximum period permitted by law, all of its voting rights as shareholders of VIEs;\n\u25cf Technical Service Agreement - A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the PRC had the exclusive right to provide technical service, marketing and management consulting service, financial support service and human resource support services to the VIEs, and the VIEs were required to take all commercially reasonable efforts to permit and facilitate the provision of the services;\n\u25cf Spousal Consent - The spouses of the VIEs\u2019 shareholders unconditionally and irrevocably agreed to the execution of the Equity Pledge Agreement, Call Option Agreement and Power of Attorney agreement;\n\u25cf Letter of Indemnification - A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the PRC agreed to indemnify such nominee shareholder against any personal, tax or other liabilities incurred in connection with their role in equity transfer to the greatest extent permitted under PRC law;\n\u25cf Management Services Agreement - In addition to agreements described above, another of the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into a Management Services Agreement with each VIE. Pursuant to such Management Services Agreement, the wholly-owned subsidiary had the exclusive right to provide to the VIE management, financial and other services related to the operation of the VIE\u2019s business, and the VIE was required to take all commercially reasonable efforts to permit and facilitate the provision of the services by the subsidiary. In addition, at the sole discretion of the subsidiary, the VIE was obligated to transfer to the subsidiary, or its designee, any part or all of the business, personnel, assets and operations of the VIE which could be lawfully conducted, employed, owned or operated by the subsidiary; and\n\u25cf Loan Agreement - Pursuant to the Loan Agreement dated April 5, 2016, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the PRC agreed to lend RMB 19.8 million and RMB 0.2 million, respectively, to the VIEs\u2019 Shareholders, one of whom is the spouse of Dr. Wu, the Company\u2019s former Chairman. The termination of the Loan Agreement resulted in a loss of $5.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOur Unconsolidated Equity Investments\nWe hold a 34.0% ownership interest in Glory, which through its subsidiary Tree Manufacturing, holds a domestic EV manufacturing license in Malaysia. Tree Manufacturing had entered into a product supply and a product distribution arrangement for EVs with Tree Technologies, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company.\nIn 2018, we signed an investment agreement to establish Intelligenta for providing services for financial or energy industries by utilizing AI and big data technology in the United States. We hold a 60.0% ownership interest and Seasail holds 40% of Intelligenta.\nOn October 22, 2020, the Company acquired 1.4 million common shares, representing 15.0% of the total common shares outstanding, of Solectrac for a purchase price of $0.91 per share, for total consideration of $1.3 million. On November 19, 2020, Ideanomics acquired an additional 1.3 million shares of common stock for $1.00 per share, for a subsequent investment of $1.3 million. With this subsequent investment, Ideanomics owned 2.7 million common shares out of a total number of issued and outstanding common shares of 10.2 million after the transaction, or 27.0%.\nSolectrac develops, assembles and distributes 100% battery-powered electric tractors-an alternative to diesel tractors-for agriculture and utility operations. Solectrac tractors provide an opportunity for farmers around the world to power their tractors by using the sun, wind, and other clean renewable sources of energy.\nOur investments in Glory, BDCG and Solectrac, where we may exercise significant influence, but not control, are classified as a long-term equity investments and accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of undistributed earnings or losses of the investee. Investment losses are recognized until the investment is written down to nil, provided that we do not guarantee the investee\u2019s obligations or we are committed to provide additional funding.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded impairment losses with respect to its equity method investments of $16.6 million and $13.1 million, respectively.\nRefer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nOur Competition\nIdeanomics Mobility Business Unit\nThe Company\u2019s EV business operates in the market for fleet commercial vehicles, this market is still in its development stage. The Company could face competition from other companies that develop and operate a similar integrated platform for the procurement, purchase, financing, charging and energy management needs of fleet EV operators. The Company could also face competition from companies that only operate in one part of the vehicle purchase and operation cycle, for example, an EV vehicle or battery manufacturer may sell directly to EV fleet operators while also participating in the platform operated by the Company\u2019s MEG business.\nOther\nGrapevine competes in the consumer marketing sector and specializes in designing and managing \u201cinfluencer\u201d led social media campaigns for brands and advertising agencies that do not have a capability to manage influencer marketing campaigns directly. This is a very competitive sector with multiple competitors.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records and reports revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., particularly ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers which provides guidance on how revenues should be reported and the timing of when revenues should be reported. ASC 606 includes guidance on when revenue should be recognized on a Gross (Principal) or Net (Agent) basis, the Company\u2019s contracts are typically with large enterprises and consequently are heavily negotiated as to the services to be provided; consequently the accounting treatment for the reporting of revenues may vary materially between contracts including whether the revenue is reported on a Principal (Gross) or Agent (Net) basis.\nRegulation\nGeneral Regulation of Businesses in the PRC\nWe are required to obtain government approval from or filing with the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d) and/or other government agencies in the PRC for transactions, such as our acquisition or disposition of business entities in the PRC. Additionally, foreign ownership of certain business and assets in the PRC is not permitted without specific government approval.\nInvestment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Special Administrative Measures for Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List) (\"Negative List\") and the Catalogue of Industries for Encouraged Foreign Investment (\"Encouraged Foreign Investment Catalogue,\" together with the Negative List, the \"Catalogue,\") which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the MOFCOM and the National Development and Reform Commission. The Catalogue sets forth the industries in which foreign investments are encouraged, restricted, or prohibited. Industries that are not listed in any of the above three categories are permitted areas for foreign investments and are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations. Establishment of wholly foreign owned enterprises is generally allowed in encouraged and permitted industries. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category.\nUnder PRC law, the establishment of a wholly foreign owned enterprise is subject to the approval of or filing with the MOFCOM or its local counterparts and the wholly foreign owned enterprise must register with the competent administration for market regulation. Our significant PRC subsidiaries have duly obtained all material approvals required for their business operations.\nIn addition, the transportation sector is subject to regulation at the central and provincial level. The PRC government may issue from time to time new laws or new interpretations on existing laws, some of which are not published on a timely basis or may have retroactive effect. Administrative and court proceedings in the PRC may also be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.. Regulatory risk also encompasses the interpretation by the tax authorities of current tax laws, and our legal structure and scope of operations in the PRC, which could be subject to further restrictions resulting in limitations on our ability to conduct business in the PRC.\nChinese regulations will also significantly impact our MEG business unit. For example, in September 2017, reports were published that the PRC may begin prohibiting the practice of using digital assets for capital fundraising. In 2018, reports surfaced that the PRC had banned local digital asset exchanges from operating within the country. On January 10, 2019, the Cyberspace Administration of China passed the Administrative Provisions on Blockchain Information Services (\u201cProvisions on Blockchain,\u201d) which took effect on February 19, 2019. The Provisions on Blockchain clarify terms of the scope of blockchain information services, the filing process for blockchain information services, the responsibilities for blockchain information service providers, and the consequences of violations. Until there is greater regulatory clarity and acceptance of digital token and blockchain-based financial products in the PRC, we may not be able to provide services under our MEG business unit in the PRC.\nTaxation\nOn March 16, 2007, the National People\u2019s Congress of the PRC passed the Enterprise Income Tax law (\u201cEIT Law,\u201d) and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China passed its implementing rules which took effect on January 1, 2008. The EIT Law and its implementing rules impose a unified earned income tax (\u201cEIT\u201d) rate of 25.0% on all domestic-invested enterprises and foreign invested enterprises (\u201cFIEs\u201d) unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions. In addition, under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and will normally be subject to an EIT of 25% on its global income. The implementing rules define the term \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d as \u201can establishment that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the production, business, personnel, accounting, etc., of a Chinese enterprise.\u201d If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine that we should be classified as a resident enterprise, then our organization\u2019s global income will be subject to PRC income tax of 25%. For detailed discussion of PRC tax issues related to resident enterprise status, see Part I-",
    "item_7": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management\u2019s discussion and analysis is presented in five sections as below and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains certain forward-looking information. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d above for certain information concerning those forward-looking statements.\n\u25cf Overview\n\u25cf Results of Operations\n\u25cf Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u25cf Outlook\n\u25cf Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOVERVIEW\nIdeanomics, Inc. (Nasdaq: IDEX) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 19, 2004. From 2010 through 2017, our primary business activities were providing premium content video on demand (\u201cVOD\u201d) services, with primary operations in the PRC, through our subsidiaries and variable interest entities under the brand name You-on-Demand (\u201cYOD.\u201d) We closed the YOD business during 2019.\nStarting in early 2017, the Company transitioned its business model to become a next-generation financial technology (\u201cfintech\u201d) company. The Company built a network of businesses, operating principally in the trading of petroleum products and electronic components that the Company believed had significant potential to recognize benefits from blockchain and AI technologies including, for example, enhancing operations, addressing cost inefficiencies, improving documentation and standardization, unlocking asset value and improving customer engagement. During 2018 the Company ceased operations in the petroleum products and electronic components trading businesses and disposed of the businesses during 2019. As we looked to deploy fintech solutions in late 2018 and into 2019, we found a unique opportunity in the Chinese EV industry to facilitate large scale conversion of fleet vehicles from internal combustion engines to EV. This led us to establish our MEG business unit to take advantage of this opportunity, subsequently we have extended our EV business to the ASEAN countries and have made an acquisition in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2021.\nFintech continues to be an important area for us as we look to invest in and develop businesses that can improve the financial services industry, particularly as it relates to digital securities.\nPrincipal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance\nOur business is expected to be impacted by both macroeconomic and Ideanomics-specific factors. The following factors have been part of the transformation of the Company which affected the results of our operations in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\u25cf Our ability to transform our business and to meet internal or external expectations of future performance. In connection with this transformation, we are in the process of considerable changes, which include assembling a new management team in the United States and overseas, reconfiguring our business structure, continuing to further enhance our controls, procedures, and oversight during this transformation, and expanding our mission and business lines for continued growth. It is uncertain whether these efforts will prove beneficial or whether we will be able to develop the necessary business models, infrastructure and systems to support our businesses. To succeed, among other things, we will need to have or hire the right talent to execute our business strategy. Market acceptance of new product and service offerings will be dependent in part on our ability to include functionality and usability that address customer requirements, and optimally price our products and services to meet customer demand and cover our costs.\n\u25cf Our ability to remain competitive. We will continue to face intense competition: these new technologies are constantly evolving, and our competitors may introduce new platforms and solutions that are superior to ours. In addition, our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, marketing and sale of their products than we can. We may never establish and maintain a competitive position in the hybrid financing and logistics management businesses.\n\u25cf The fluctuation in earnings resulting from acquisitions, strategic equity investments, the formation of joint ventures, and in-licenses of technology. Our results of operations may fluctuate from period to period based on our entry into new transactions to expand our business. In addition, while we intend to contribute cash and other assets to our investments, we do not intend for our holding company to conduct significant research and development activities. In general we intend research and development activities to be conducted by our technology partners and licensors. These fluctuations in growth or costs and in our investments and partnerships may contribute to significant fluctuations in the results of our operations.\nLiquidity Improvements\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company improved its liquidity position by raising a total of $225.5 million: $191.4 million through the issuance of common stock and exercise of warrants, $7.1 million from noncontrolling interest shareholders, and $27.0 million through the issuance of senior secured convertible notes. The Company converted senior secured convertible notes of $34.4 million plus accrued interest of $0.3 million to common stock. Additionally, the Company converted $4.6 million of convertible notes payable and accrued interest to related parties and an additional $1.5 million due to related parties to common stock. As a result of these actions, the Company reduced its the principal amount of its indebtedness by $50.9 million, and as of December 31, 2020, had cash and cash equivalents of $165.8 million, $163.8 million of which is held in U.S. financial institutions.\nBased upon its business projections and its cash and cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 2020, the Company believes it has the ability to continue as a going concern.\nEffects of COVID-19\nNovel Coronavirus 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) is an infectious disease cause by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China\u2019s Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 21, 2021, over 122.9 million cases had been reported across the globe, resulting in 2.7 million deaths.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused significant disruption to society as a whole, including the workplace. The resulting impact to the global supply chain has disrupted most aspects of national and international commerce, with government-mandated social distancing measures imposing stay-at-home and work-from-home orders in almost every country. The effects of social distancing have shut down significant parts of the local, regional, national, and international economies, for limited or extended periods of time, with the exception of government designated essential services.\nIn many parts of the world, stay-at-home and work-from-home orders were relaxed during the summer of 2020 as the effects of the Coronavirus appeared to lessen, and economic activity began to recover. However, commencing in the autumn and fall of 2020, the U.S. as well as countries in Europe, South America and Asia began to experience an increase in new COVID-19 cases, and in some cases local, state, and national governments began to reinstate restrictive measures to stem the spread of the virus. The U.S. and other countries also experienced an increase in new COVID-19 cases after the fall and winter holiday season, with new, more infectious variants of COVID-19 identified. Various vaccines have been developed, with vaccinations programs in effect worldwide, though reaching acceptable levels for worldwide immunization against COVID-19 remains challenging.\nThe future effects of the virus are difficult to predict, due to uncertainty about the course of the virus, different variants that may evolve, and the supply of the vaccine on a local, regional, and global basis, as well as the ability to implement vaccination programs in a short time frame.\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations are in the development or early stage, have not had significant revenues to date, and the Company does not anticipate significant adverse effects on its operations\u2019 revenue as compared to its business plan in the near- or mid-term, although the future effects of COVID-19 may result in regional restrictive measures which may constrain the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company continues to monitor the overall situation with COVID-19 and its effects on both local, regional and global economies.\nInformation about segments\nThe Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker has been identified as the chief executive officer, who reviews consolidated results when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the Company. Therefore, the Company operates in one segment with two business units: Ideanomics Mobility and Ideanomics Capital.\nOur Unconsolidated Equity Investments\nThe investments where the Company exercises significant influence, but not control, are classified as long-term equity investments and accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of undistributed earnings or losses of the investee. Investment losses are recognized until the investment is written down to nil, provided that we do not guarantee the investee\u2019s obligations or we are committed to provide additional funding. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nTaxation\nUnited States\nIdeanomics, Inc., M.Y. Products, LLC, Grapevine Logic, Inc., Delaware Board of Trade Holdings, Inc., Fintech Village, LLC are United States companies subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. No provision for income taxes has been provided as none of the companies had taxable profit since inception. At the acquisition of Grapevine Logic, Inc. in 2018, deferred tax liabilities were recorded relating to intangible assets recorded for financial reporting purposes but not recognized for income tax purposes. The intangible assets consequently could not provide deductible amortization expense for income tax purposes. The deferred tax liabilities were recorded on the acquisition date to the extent that they could not be offset by usable net operating loss carryforwards acquired in the acquisition. These deferred tax liabilities were reduced, providing an income tax benefit, to the extent that the intangible assets were reduced by amortization expense and additional net operating loss carry forwards were created to offset the liabilities. These benefits include $152,875 in 2019. The 2019 amount related to activities in the first two quarters of 2019. Ideanomics, Inc. increased its ownership in Grapevine Logic, Inc. such that beginning with the third quarter of 2019, the result of which was that Grapevine Logic, Inc. activities would be included in the consolidated tax return of Ideanomics, Inc. As a result, the valuation allowance provided against Ideanomics\u2019 deferred tax assets were reduced by $361,059, the amount of Grapevine Logic, Inc.\u2019s remaining deferred tax liabilities as that portion of Ideanomics Inc.\u2019s net operating loss carryovers could now be utilized to offset these liabilities.\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) of 2017 includes provision for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) under which taxes on foreign income are imposed on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. TCJA also enacted the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d) under which taxes are imposed on certain base eroding payments to related foreign companies, subject to certain requirements.\nBased on current year financial results, the company has determined that there is no GILTI nor BEAT tax liability.\nIn addition, the TCJA now entitles U.S. companies that owns 10.0% or more of a foreign corporation a 100% dividends-received deduction for the foreign-source portion of dividends paid by such foreign corporation. Also, net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) arising after December 31, 2017 are deductible only to the extent of 80.0% of the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income, and may be carried forward indefinitely but generally not allowed to be carried back.\nCayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands\nUnder current laws of the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands, the Company is not subject to tax on its income or capital gains. In addition, dividend payments are not subject to withholding tax in the Cayman Islands or British Virgin Islands.\nHong Kong\nThe Company\u2019s subsidiaries incorporated in Hong Kong are subject to Profits Tax of 16.5%. Tax expense of $0.1 million was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2019 relating to the income on one Hong Kong subsidiary relating to a gain recorded on the sale of VIE related assets. All other Hong Kong subsidiaries had losses for 2019 and the resulting deferred tax assets relating to the loss carryovers were fully offset by a valuation allowance.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China\nUnder the PRC\u2019s Enterprise Income Tax Law, the company\u2019s Chinese subsidiaries and VIEs are subject to an EIT of 25.0%.\nThe Company\u2019s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as tax legislation, geographic composition of its pre-tax income and non-tax deductible expenses incurred. The Company\u2019s management regularly monitors these legislative developments to determine if there are changes in the statutory income tax rate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, one of the Company\u2019s PRC subsidiaries incurred a tax obligation of $0.6 million relating to its EV sales. The entity did not have operating loss carryovers and is not able to utilize the loss carryovers of other subsidiaries. The transactions under which the VIE agreements were terminated resulted in gains to one VIE entity, prior to deconsolidation, that triggered a tax expense of $0.2 million. Other PRC entities either had losses that created additional operating loss carryovers, where the related deferred tax assets were offset by a valuation allowance, or had income that would have resulted in a current tax liability, except that they were able to offset those liabilities with operating loss carryovers from prior years. The use of prior year carryovers, in all cases for which the related deferred tax assets all had previously been offset by a valuation allowance, avoided $0.2 million of income tax expense.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (USD in thousands, except per share amounts)\nFor the years ended December 31,\nAmount Change\n% Change\nRevenue\n$\n26,759\n$\n44,566\n$\n(17,807)\n(40)\n%\nCost of revenue\n24,702\n1,458\n23,244\nn/m\nGross profit\n2,057\n43,108\n(41,051)\n(95)\n%\nOperating expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n32,399\n24,862\n7,537\n%\nResearch and development expense\n1,635\n-\n1,635\nn/m\nProfessional fees\n12,541\n5,828\n6,713\nn/m\nDepreciation and amortization\n5,310\n2,229\n3,081\nn/m\nImpairment losses\n42,554\n73,669\n(31,115)\n(42)\n%\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration, net\n(5,503)\n5,094\n(10,597)\nn/m\nTotal operating expenses\n88,936\n111,682\n(22,746)\n(20)\n%\nLoss from operations\n(86,879)\n(68,574)\n(18,305)\n%\nInterest and other income (expense):\nInterest expense, net\n(15,970)\n(5,616)\n(10,354)\nn/m\nExpense due to conversion of notes\n(2,266)\n-\n(2,266)\nn/m\nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt\n8,891\n(3,940)\n12,831\nn/m\nImpairment of and equity in loss of equity method investees\n(16,698)\n(13,718)\n(2,980)\n%\nGain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries, net\n(952)\n1,228\nn/m\nLoss on remeasurement of DBOT investment\n-\n(3,179)\n3,179\nn/m\nOther income (expense), net\n6,603\n(433)\n7,036\nn/m\nLoss before income taxes and non-controlling interest\n(106,043)\n(96,412)\n(9,631)\n%\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n-\n(417)\nn/m\nNet loss\n(106,043)\n(96,829)\n(9,214)\n%\nDeemed dividend related to warrant repricing\n(184)\n(827)\n(78)\n%\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders\n(106,227)\n(97,656)\n(8,571)\n%\nNet (income) loss attributable to non-controlling interest\n7,827\n(852)\n8,679\nn/m\nNet loss attributable to IDEX common shareholders\n$\n(98,400)\n$\n(98,508)\n$\n%\nBasic and diluted loss per share\n$\n(0.46)\n$\n(0.82)\nRevenues (USD in thousands)\nFor the years ended December 31,\nAmount Change\n% Change\nDigital asset management services\n$\n-\n$\n40,700\n$\n(40,700)\nn/m\nElectric vehicles\n19,462\n2,693\n16,769\nn/m\nCombustion engine vehicles\n5,160\n-\n5,160\nn/m\nCharging and batteries\n-\nn/m\nDigital advertising services\n1,631\n1,173\n%\nTotal\n$\n26,759\n$\n44,566\n$\n(17,807)\n(40)\n%\nn/m = Not Meaningful\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $26.8 million as compared to $44.6 million for the same period in 2019, a decrease of $17.8 million, or 40%. The decrease was due to a change to our business focus from digital asset management services to the EV business. The Company generated $19.5 million from the sale of EVs as compared to $2.7 million in the prior year, an increase of $16.8 million. In the current year, the Company earned revenues of $5.2 million from the sale of combustion engine vehicles; the sale of combustion engine vehicles is not the Company\u2019s primary focus, however, from time to time, the Company will sell combustion engine vehicles if a client places an order. During 2020, the Company made its first sales of charging and battery equipment. The Company believes this is very encouraging development as the provision of charging, battery and battery swap services is an important strategic focus for the Company. Revenues from Grapevine, the Company\u2019s business focused on digital advertising services were $1.6 million as compared to $1.2 million in the prior year, an increase of $0.5 million or 39%. Grapevine is considered a non-core asset for Ideanomics.\nThe revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were recorded on either a Principal or Agent basis, depending on the terms of the underlying transaction, including the ability to control the product and the level of inventory risk taken. The majority of the revenue from the sale of EVs, as well as revenue from the sale of the combustion engine vehicles and charging and batteries for the year ended December 31, 2020 were recorded on a Principal basis because the Company has inventory risk in the transactions. The revenue from the sale of EVs for the year ended December 31, 2019 was recorded on an Agent basis due to the terms of the transaction.\nCost of revenue (USD in thousands)\nFor the years ended December 31,\nAmount Change\n% Change\nDigital asset management services\n$\n-\n$\n$\n(467)\nn/m\nElectric vehicles\n18,035\n-\n18,035\nn/m\nCombustion engine vehicles\n5,121\n-\n5,121\nn/m\nCharging and batteries\n-\nn/m\nDigital advertising services\n1,058\n6.7\n%\nTotal\n$\n24,702\n$\n1,458\n$\n23,244\nn/m\nn/m = Not Meaningful\nCost of revenues was $24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The cost of revenues increased by $23.2 million. From a comparability perspective, the cost of revenue during 2019 is not indicative of the new business in 2020. The cost of revenue during 2019 was primarily associated with the digital asset management services and creator payments from the Grapevine business. The cost of revenue from the sale of EVs was $18.0 million; there was no cost of revenue recorded for the sale of EVs during 2019 as the company acted as agent in the sale of EVs in 2019 and consequently revenues were recorded on \u201cnet\u201d basis without any corresponding cost of revenues. Cost of revenues from the sale of combustion engine vehicles was $5.1 million; there were no sales of combustion engine vehicles in the prior year. Cost of revenues for charging and batteries was $0.5 million; there were no sales of charging and batteries in the prior year. The cost of revenues for the digital advertising services provided by Grapevine were $1.1 million as compared to $1.0 million in the prior year, an increase of almost $0.1 million or 6.7%.\nGross profit (USD in thousands)\nFor the years ended December 31,\nAmount Change\n% Change\nDigital asset management services\n$\n-\n$\n40,233\n$\n(40,233)\nn/m\nElectric vehicles\n1,427\n2,693\n(1,266)\nn/m\nCombustion engine vehicles\n-\nn/m\nCharging and batteries\n-\nn/m\nDigital advertising services\nn/m\nTotal\n$\n2,057\n$\n43,108\n$\n(41,051)\nn/m\nn/m = Not Meaningful\nGross profit ratio\nFor the years ended December 31,\nDigital asset management services\n-\n%\n%\nElectric vehicles\nCombustion engine vehicles\n-\nCharging and batteries\n-\nDigital advertising services\nTotal\n%\n%\nThe gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.1 million, as compared to $43.1 million during the same period in 2019, a decrease of $41.1 million. The decrease was due to the Company recorded service revenue from digital asset management services in 2019 which was not repeated in 2020 and had a low cost of revenue. The gross profit earned from the sale of EVs was $1.4 million a decrease of $1.3 million from the prior year. The Company acted in an agent capacity in the sale of EVs in 2019 and consequentially the revenue was recorded on a \u201cnet\u201d basis without any cost of revenue which resulted in a higher gross profit and gross margin.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nOur selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $32.4 million as compared to $24.9 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $7.5 million or 30%. The majority of the increase was due to increased stock based compensation expense, bonuses and sales commissions and salaries resulting from the increase in employee numbers and sales activity, and bad debt expense which was partially offset by lower spending on travel and entertainment due to the restrictions on travel and entertaining arising from COVID-19 and lower severance expense.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents the fees paid for EV technical development and design.\nProfessional fees\nProfessional fees for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $12.5 million as compared to $5.8 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $6.7 million. The majority of this increase was due to increased expense for investor relations programs, legal fee expense related to regulatory enquires, fund raising and merger and acquisition activities, and class action lawsuits. Expenses for consultants and contractors increased as a result of the Company\u2019s continued expansion.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $ 5.3 million as compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2019, an increase of $3.1 million. The increase was mainly due to the increase in amortization expense of $2.1 million arising from the shortening of the useful life on an intellectual property intangible asset.\nImpairment losses\nThe following table summarizes the impairment losses recorded in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nAsset Impaired\nNote\nCaption\nAmount\nGTB - digital currency\nNote 9 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nImpairment losses\n$\n-\n$\n61,124\nEquity method investments\nNote 10 - Long-term Investments\nImpairment of and equity in loss of equity method investments\n16,650\n13,062\nIntangible assets\nNote 9 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nImpairment losses\n20,446\n5,715\nGoodwill\nNote 9 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nImpairment losses\n9,323\n-\nRight of use assets\nNote 11 - Leases\nImpairment losses\n6,424\n-\nFintech buildings, land and capitalized fees\nNote 8 - Property and Equipment, net\nImpairment losses\n3,315\n2,299\nFintech buildings asset retirement cost\nNote 8 - Property and Equipment, net\nImpairment losses\n1,996\n1,504\nFixed assets and other\n-\nCost method investments\nNote 10 - Long-term Investments\nImpairment losses\n3,026\nTotal\n$\n59,318\n$\n86,730\nAdditional information related to the impairment losses recorded in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2020\n\u25cf The Company recorded impairment losses of $16.7 million related to its equity method investments, Glory and BDCG. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Tree Technologies obtained its own domestic manufacturing license, and determined that it would not purchase vehicles from Tree Manufacturing, Glory\u2019s subsidiary, and that the investment in Glory was therefore impaired. The Company evaluated the business prospects of BDCG in light of the continued political tensions between China and the U.S., and determined that its business prospects had diminished.\n\u25cf The Company recorded impairment losses of $20.4 million related to intangible assets:\no An impairment loss of $12.5 million related to Tree Technologies marketing and distribution agreement with Tree Manufacturing after Tree manufacturing obtained its own domestic manufacturing license, and determining that it would not purchase vehicles from Tree Manufacturing.\no Impairment losses of $7.1 million related to DBOT\u2019s intangible assets, its continuing membership agreement and customer list.\no An impairment loss of $0.8 million related to Grapevine\u2019s influencer network, after determining that the attrition rate of the influencer network was higher than expected.\n\u25cf The Company recorded an impairment loss of $9.3 million related to the goodwill of its consolidated subsidiary, DBOT, after evaluating its business prospects.\n\u25cf The Company recorded impairment losses of $6.4 million related to right of use assets after ceasing to use the related real estate premises.\n\u25cf The Company recorded impairment losses of $3.3 million related to its investment in Fintech Village, and recorded an impairment loss of $2.0 million for the related asset retirement cost.\n\u25cf The Company recorded an impairment loss of $0.2 million related to a cost method investment after its price per share declined in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019\n\u25cf The Company recorded an impairment loss of $61.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to GTB which the Company had received in connections with a services agreement and an asset purchase agreement with GT Dollar Pte, a minority shareholder at the time of the transaction. On October 29, 2019, GTB had an unexpected significant decline in quoted price, from $17.00 to $1.84. This decline continued through the fourth quarter of 2019, and on December 31, 2019 the quoted price was $0.23. As a result of this decline in quoted price, and its inability to convert GTB into other digital currencies which were more liquid, or fiat currency, the Company performed an impairment analysis and recorded an impairment loss.\n\u25cf The Company recorded a $13.1 million impairment loss in Glory, an equity method investment, in the fourth quarter of 2019, when it became apparent that Glory\u2019s subsidiary, Tree Manufacturing, would not receive the land use rights to 250 acres of vacant land and other assets.\n\u25cf The Company recorded a $5.7 million impairment loss related to a secure mobile financial information, social, and messaging platform that has been designed for streamlining financial-based communication for professional and retail users. Management determined these assets had no future use and recorded an impairment loss.\n\u25cf The Company recorded impairment losses of $3.0 million in two non-marketable equity investments after management evaluated their performance.\n\u25cf The Company recorded an impairment loss of $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2019 in connection with four buildings in Fintech Village, which were later demolished, and recorded an impairment loss of $1.5 million for the related asset retirement cost.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration, net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Change in fair value of contingent consideration, net of $5.5 million represents the remeasurement loss of $1.5 million of the contingent consideration payable to the former DBOT shareholder and remeasurement gain of $7.0 million of the contingent consideration payable to the Tree Technology shareholders.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, Change in fair value of contingent consideration, net of $5.1 million represents the remeasurement of the contingent consideration payable to the former DBOT shareholders due to the decline in Ideanomics\u2019 stock price.\nLoss from operations\nLoss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $86.9 million as compared to loss of $68.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 an increase of $18.3 million. The increased Loss from Operations is due to number of factors, the gross profit for 2019 included revenues from digital asset services which had a gross profit margin of almost 100% which was not repeated in 2020, increased expenses for selling, general and administrative, research and development, professional fees, and depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by lower impairment charges and a gain resulting from a change in the fair value of contingent consideration.\nInterest expense, net\nOur interest expense increased $10.4 million to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $5.6 million during 2019. The interest expense increase during 2020 was primarily due to the amortization of beneficial conversion features and the interest associated with convertible notes issued in 2020. The following table summarizes the breakdown of the interest expense (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\nYear ended December 31,\nInterest, net\n$\n1,485\n$\n1,381\nAmortization of discount\n14,485\n4,235\nTotal\n$\n15,970\n$\n5,616\nExpense due to conversion of notes\nExpense due to conversion of notes for the year ended December 31, 2020 represents the expense recognized as a result of the reduction of conversion price to induce the conversion of the convertible notes from the related parties.\nGain (loss) on extinguishment of debt\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a gain on the extinguishment of debt of $8.9 million, as it paid a promissory note prior to its scheduled maturity. The Company also settled several outstanding balances with vendors and recorded a gain of $0.5 million.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $3.9 million which resulted from modifications made to various convertible notes.\nImpairment of and equity in loss of equity method investees\nImpairment of and equity in loss of equity method investments increased by $3.0 million to $16.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from $13.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to impairments losses of $16.7 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an impairment loss of $13.1 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to \u201cImpairment losses\u201d above.\nGain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries, net\nThe following table summarizes gains and (losses) recorded in \u201cGain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries, net\u201d in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nYear ended December 31,\nYear ended December 31,\nSubsidiary\nGuang Min\n$\n$\n-\nRed Rock Global Capital LTD\n-\nAmer Global Technology Limited\n-\nDeconsolidation of VIEs\n-\n(2,009)\nTotal\n$\n$\n(952)\nGain (loss) on disposal of subsidiaries was a gain of $0.3 million for year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to a loss of $1.0 million in the same period in 2019.\nLoss on remeasurement of DBOT investment\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company increased its ownership in DBOT and consolidated DBOT in July 2019. Immediately prior to the consummation of the acquisition, the Company\u2019s investment in DBOT had a fair value of $3.1 million, and the Company recorded a loss of $3.2 million to record the investment in DBOT to its fair value.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net increased $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 in comparison to the same period of 2019 mainly because of a gain of $4.9 million from the lease settlement of its New York City headquarters at 55 Broadway with the landlord, a gain of $0.8 million from the DBOT lease settlement with the landlord and sublease income $0.1 million.\nNet (income)/loss attributable to non-controlling interest\nNet (income)/loss attributable to non-controlling interests was a $7.8 million loss in 2020 as compared to a net income of $0.9 million in 2019. The loss in 2020 is primarily due to net loss from our investments in entities formed and acquired in 2019. The gain in 2019 is primarily due to the taxis commission revenue recognized in an entity we have 51% ownership during the third quarter of 2019.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash of $165.8 million. Approximately $164.5 million was held in our Hong Kong, U.S., Malaysia and Singapore entities and $1.2 million was held in our PRC entities.\nDue to the strict regulations governing the transfer of funds held in the PRC to other jurisdictions, the Company does not consider funds held in its PRC entities to be available to fund operations and investment outside of the PRC and consequently does not include them when evaluating the liquidity needs of its businesses operating outside of the PRC.\nAs a broker-dealer, DBOT has minimum capital requirements. DBOT had cash of $0.2 million as of December 31, 2020, which was necessary for DBOT to meet its minimum capital requirements. The Company consolidates a 51.0% owned investment in an entity which is based in Singapore. This entity venture had cash of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2020. The agreement of the Company\u2019s partner in this entity is required prior to disbursement of this entity\u2019s funds for certain defined expenditures.\nThe following table provides a summary of our net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities (in thousands).\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nNet cash used in operating activities\n$\n(41,468)\n$\n(13,784)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(3,500)\n(1,794)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n208,049\n15,114\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash\n(9)\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n163,131\n(473)\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period\n2,633\n3,106\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n$\n165,764\n$\n2,633\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities decreased by $27.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to (1) an increase in net loss from $96.8 million in 2019 to $106.0 million in 2020, (2) total non-cash adjustments to net loss was $75.9 million and $67.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively; and (3) total changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in an increase of $11.3 million and $15.1 million in cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $3.5 million for the year ended 2020 mainly due to the investment to Solectrac. Cash used in investing activities was $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the payment of $1.8 million for Fintech Village.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company received $182.5 million from the issuance of common stock, $8.9 million from warrant and option exercise, $27.0 million from the issuance of convertible notes, $7.1 million from noncontrolling shareholders contribution and made repayments of $17.5 million, primarily of a $12.0 million convertible note and other borrowings. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company received $9.1 million from the issuance of convertible notes, $2.8 million in proceeds in a private placement from the issuance of common shares, warrant and options for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation and changing prices have had an effect on our business and we expect that inflation or changing prices could materially affect our business in the foreseeable future. Our management will closely monitor the price change and make efforts to maintain effective cost control in operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements are obligations the Company has with nonconsolidated entities related to transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements. The Company holds variable interests in investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company does not control these investments and therefore does not consolidate them.\nWe do not have other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to an investor in our securities.\nContractual Obligations\nThe tabular presentation of contractual obligations is not required for Smaller Reporting Companies.\nSeasonality\nThe Company expects that orders and sales will be influenced by the amount and timing of budgeted expenditure by its customers. Typically, the Company would expect to see higher sales at the start of the year when companies start executing on their capital programs and at the end of the year when companies are spending any surplus or uncommitted budget before the new budget cycle commences. The Company\u2019s operating businesses are in the early stage of their development and consequently do not have sufficient trading histories to project seasonal buying patterns with any degree of confidence.\nOUTLOOK\nThe Company believes that the investment made to build out its sales capacity in China and a related capability in sourcing and supply chain and related logistics in China will help drive growth in China using the Company's S2F2C business model and enable the Company to source high quality components and completed vehicles at competitive prices for its Medici, Treeletrik, WAVE and Solectrac businesses outside of China. The global focus on climate change and the related regulatory changes to encourage the adoption of EVs is very favorable for the Company's business, particularly the charging and battery businesses, which are critical to the widespread adoption of EVs. Providing customers with easy access to financing options for their purchases of vehicles, batteries and charging infrastructure is an important enabler for the deployment of EV and related technologies and the Company will continue to work to develop funding sources in conjunction with manufactures and established lenders.\nFintech continues to provide opportunities which could generate high rates of return through the deployment of technology to disrupt existing business models. The Company's acquisition of Timios in the first quarter of 2021 marks the first entrance into the real estate title agency and closing market. Management believes that through deployment of advanced technology and complimentary acquisitions it can increase Timios' value. The regulatory environment for the adoption of digital securities is improving with regulators and central bankers in the world's most developed economies acknowledging that digital securities should be part of the financial ecosystem. This change favors companies like Ideanomics that have assets such as DBOT that are fundamental building blocks of any move towards digital securities.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, hazardous materials, environmental contamination and the protection of the environment. We have made, and expect to make in the future, expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. We may also incur fines and penalties from time to time associated with noncompliance with such laws and regulations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Company\u2019s management to make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. Company management has identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of its financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and require management\u2019s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management\u2019s current judgments. Company management believes the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its financial statements. Company management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company accounts for variable interest entities in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Boards (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 810, Consolidation. Management evaluates the relationships between the Company and the various VIEs and the economic benefit flow of the contractual arrangement with the VIEs. In connection with such evaluation, management also considers whether or not, as a result of such contractual arrangements, the Company controls the legal shareholders\u2019 voting interests and has power of attorney in the VIEs, and therefore which counterparty is able to direct all business activities of the VIEs. As a result of such evaluation, management concluded that the Company is the primary beneficiary of certain VIEs, which are consolidated, and that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of one investment in which the Company holds a 60.0% interest, and of one investment in which the Company holds a 34.0% investment and which had a supply agreement with a consolidated entity. Both of these investments are accounted for as an equity method investments.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company has terminated the agreements with the PRC VIEs and will not consolidate them beyond that date.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of the promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition for the arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606,\u201d) the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with the customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the respective performance obligations.\nA performance obligation may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied over time is generally evaluated by measuring our progress in satisfying the performance obligation as evidenced by the transfer of the goods or services to the customer. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control over the promised good.\nThe amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the promised goods or services, or the transaction price. In determining the transaction price, we evaluate consideration promised in a contract that includes a variable amount, or variable consideration, and estimate the amount of consideration that is due to us. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that we believe it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized will not occur.\nAdditionally, an analysis is performed in order to evaluate whether the Company is acting as a principal, in which case revenue is reported on a gross basis, or as an agent, in which case revenue is reported on a net basis. This analysis considers whether or not the Company obtains control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts are typically with large enterprises and consequently are heavily negotiated as to the services to be provided; consequently the accounting treatment for the reporting of revenues may vary materially between contracts including whether the revenue is reported on a gross or net basis.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount.\nFactors which could result in the Company performing an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our business, and significant negative industry or economic trends.\nThe Company received a specific type of digital currency, GTB, as a result of two transactions in the three months ended March 31, 2019, and recorded the GTB currency as indefinite-lived intangible assets. On October 29, 2019, GTB had an unexpected significant decline in quoted price, from $17.00 to $1.84. This decline continued through the fourth quarter of 2019, and on December 31, 2020 the quoted price was $0.23. As a result of this decline in quoted price, and its inability to convert GTB into other digital currencies which were more liquid, or fiat currency, the Company performed an impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2019 and recorded an impairment loss of $61.1 million.\nThe assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long-lived assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for future expansion development.\nAs a result of the impairment analyses performed in the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses related to land, asset retirement costs, influencer networks, a membership agreement, and a marketing and distribution agreement of $22.5 million.\nAs part of the impairment analyses discussed above in the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also evaluated the remaining useful life of intangible assets, and determined that one intangible asset, intellectual property, no longer had a useful life and recorded amortization expense of $2.1 million.\nAs a result of the impairment analyses performed in the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment loss related to a secure mobile financial information, social and messaging platform of $5.7 million.\nAcquisition accounting\nOur consolidated financial statements include the operations of acquired businesses subsequent to the closing of the transaction. We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including the identification of and our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from our management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nWhen estimating fair value, depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability, we may use one or all of the following techniques:\n\u25cf Income approach, which is based on the present value of a future stream of net cash flows;\n\u25cf Market approach, which is based on market prices and other information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities; and\n\u25cf Cost approach, which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable assets, less an allowance for functional and/or economic obsolescence.\nFair value methodologies depend on the following types of inputs:\n\u25cf Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets (Level 1 inputs);\n\u25cf Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable, or inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means (Level 2 inputs); and\n\u25cf Unobservable inputs that reflect estimates and assumptions (Level 3 inputs).\nThe determination of fair value is extremely subjective and complex, and requires judgements concerning future events, including future cash flows, the appropriate discount factors and weighted average cost of capital, and market comparables, among other factors. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Application of goodwill impairment tests requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value of each reporting unit. The Company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level which is defined as the operating segment or one level below the operating segment. One level below the operating segment, or component, is a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually (during the fourth quarter), or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying amount. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using qualitative and/or quantitative testing procedures.\nThe Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Judgment applied when performing the qualitative analysis includes consideration of macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, composition, personnel or strategy changes affecting the reporting unit and recoverability of asset groups within a reporting unit. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. However, if the Company concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount.\nThe fair value of a reporting unit may be determined using externally quoted prices (if available), a discounted cash flow model, or a market approach. Judgments applied when performing the quantitative analysis includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these judgments, estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit.\nAn impairment loss, if any, is recorded when the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying amount.\nAs a result of its goodwill impairment analyses performed in the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded goodwill impairment losses of $9.3 million. The Company recorded no goodwill impairment losses in the year ended December 31, 2019.\nLong-term Investments\nThe Company accounts for equity investments through which management exercises significant influence but does not have control over the investee under the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted for the Company\u2019s share of undistributed earnings or losses of the investee. The Company\u2019s share of losses is not recognized when the investment is reduced to zero since the Company does not guarantee the investees\u2019 obligations nor is the Company committed to providing additional funding.\nThe equity investments which are not consolidated or accounted for under the equity method are either carried at fair value or under the measurement alternative upon the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10) (\u201cASU No 2016-01.\u201d)\nThe Company utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.\nManagement periodically reviews long-term investments for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be fully recoverable. Management considers impairment indicators such as negative changes in industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. If indicators exist, further analysis must be performed in order to determine if the impairment, if any, is other-than-temporary. If the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the fair value of the investment must be determined. In the absence of quoted market prices, management must use judgement to determine the fair value of the investment, considering such factors as current economic and market conditions, the operating performance of the entities, including current earnings trends and forecasted cash flows, and other company and industry specific information. If the fair value of the investment is below the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded to record the investment at fair value.\nThe Company recorded impairment losses of $0.2 million and $3.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative, and recorded impairment losses of $16.6 million and $13.1 in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for investments accounted for as equity method investments.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

Our Board provides independent leadership in the exercise of its responsibilities. Our management oversees a system of internal controls and compliance with corporate policies and applicable laws and regulations, and our employees operate in a climate of responsibility, candor and integrity.\nCorporate Governance Guidelines\nWe and our Board are committed to high standards of corporate governance as an important component in building and maintaining shareholder value. To this end, we regularly review our corporate governance policies and practices to ensure that they are consistent with the high standards of other companies. We also closely monitor guidance issued or proposed by the SEC and the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as the emerging best practices of other companies. The current corporate governance guidelines are available on the Company\u2019s website www.ideanomics.com.

The Board has established three Committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee.\u202fEach of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee are comprised entirely of independent directors. From time to time, the Board may establish other committees. The Board has adopted a written charter for each of the Committees which are available on the Company\u2019s website www.ideanomics.com. Printed copies of these charters may be obtained, without charge, by contacting our Corporate Secretary at 1441 Broadway, Suite 5116, New York, NY 10018.\nGovernance Structure\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for corporate governance in compliance with reporting laws and for representing the interests of our shareholders. As of the date of this Annual report, the Board was composed of nine members, five of whom are considered independent, non-executive directors. Details on Board membership, oversight and activity are reported below.\nWe encourage our shareholders to learn more about our Company\u2019s governance practices at our website, www.ideanomics.com.\nThe Board\u2019s Role in Risk Oversight\nThe Board oversees that the assets of the Company are properly safeguarded, that the appropriate financial and other controls are maintained, and that the Company\u2019s business is conducted wisely and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and proper governance. Included in these responsibilities is the Board of Directors\u2019 oversight of the various risks facing the Company. In this regard, the Board seeks to understand and oversee critical business risks. The Board does not view risk in isolation. Risks are considered in virtually every business decision and as part of the Company\u2019s business strategy. The Board recognizes that it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Indeed, purposeful and appropriate risk-taking is essential for the Company to be competitive on a global basis and to achieve its objectives.\nWhile the Board oversees risk management, Company management is charged with managing risk. The Company has robust internal processes and a strong internal control environment to identify and manage risks and to communicate with the Board. The Board and the Audit Committee monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the internal controls and the risk management program at least annually. Management communicates routinely with the Board, Board committees and individual directors on the significant risks identified and how they are being managed. Directors are free to, and indeed often do, communicate directly with senior management.\nThe Board implements its risk oversight function both as a whole and through Committees. Much of the work is delegated to various Committees, which meet regularly and report back to the full Board. All Committees play significant roles in carrying out the risk oversight function. In particular:\n\u25cf The Audit Committee oversees risks related to the Company\u2019s financial statements, the financial reporting process, accounting and legal matters. The Audit Committee members meet separately with representatives of the independent auditing firm.\n\u25cf The Compensation Committee evaluates the risks and rewards associated with the Company\u2019s compensation philosophy and programs. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves compensation programs with features that mitigate risk without diminishing the incentive nature of the compensation. Management discusses with the Compensation Committee the procedures that have been put in place to identify and mitigate potential risks in compensation.\nIndependent Directors\nIn considering and making decisions as to the independence of each of the directors of the Company, the Board considered transactions and relationships between the Company (and its subsidiaries) and each director (and each member of such director\u2019s immediate family and any entity with which the director or family member has an affiliation such that the director or family member may have a material direct or indirect interest in a transaction or relationship with such entity). The Board has determined that James Cassano, Shane McMahon, Jerry Fan, and Harry Edelson are independent as defined in applicable SEC and NASDAQ rules and regulations, and that each constitutes an \u201cIndependent Director\u201d as defined in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605.\nAudit Committee\nOur Audit Committee consists of James Cassano, Harry Edelson and Jerry Fan with Mr. Cassano acting as Chair. The Audit Committee oversees our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of the financial statements of our company. Mr. Cassano serves as our Audit Committee financial experts as that term is defined by the applicable SEC rules. The Audit Committee is responsible for, among other things:\n\u25cf selecting our independent auditors and pre-approving all auditing and non-auditing services permitted to be performed by our independent auditors;\n\u25cf reviewing with our independent auditors any audit problems or difficulties and management\u2019s response;\n\u25cf reviewing and approving all proposed related-party transactions, as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended;\n\u25cf discussing the annual audited financial statements with management and our independent auditors;\n\u25cf reviewing major issues as to the adequacy of our internal controls and any special audit steps adopted in light of significant internal control deficiencies;\n\u25cf annually reviewing and reassessing the adequacy of our Audit Committee charter;\n\u25cf overseeing the work of our independent auditor, including resolution of disagreements between management and the independent auditor regarding financial reporting;\n\u25cf reporting regularly to and reviewing with the full Board any issues that arise with respect to the quality or integrity of the Company\u2019s financial statements, the performance and independence of the independent auditors and any other matters that the Audit Committee deems appropriate or is requested to review for the benefit of the Board.\nThe Audit Committee may engage independent counsel and such other advisors it deems necessary to carry out its responsibilities and powers, and, if such counsel or other advisors are engaged, shall determine the compensation or fees payable to such counsel or other advisors. The Audit Committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more of its members as the Audit Committee deems appropriate to carry out its responsibilities and exercise its powers.\nCompensation Committee\nOur Compensation Committee consists of James Cassano, Harry Edelson and Jerry Fan with Mr. Cassano acting as Chair. Our Compensation Committee assists the Board in reviewing and approving the compensation structure\u202fof\u202four directors and executive officers, including all forms of compensation to be provided to our directors and executive officers. The Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other things:\n\u25cf reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of our chief executive officer, evaluating the performance of our chief executive officer in light of those goals and objectives, and setting the compensation level of our chief executive officer based on this evaluation;\n\u25cf reviewing and making recommendations to the Board with regard to the compensation of other executive officers;\n\u25cf reviewing and making recommendations to the Board with respect to the compensation of our directors; and\n\u25cf reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding all incentive-based compensation plans and equity-based plans.\nThe Compensation Committee has sole authority to retain and terminate any consulting firm or other outside advisor to assist the committee in the evaluation of director, chief executive officer or senior executive compensation and other compensation-related matters, including sole authority to approve the firms\u2019 fees and other retention terms. The Compensation Committee may also form and delegate authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more members of the Compensation Committee.\nGovernance and Nominating Committee\nOur Governance and Nominating Committee consists of Harry Edelson, Jim Cassano and Jerry Fan with Harry Edelson acting as Chair. The Governance and Nominating Committee assists the Board of Directors in identifying individuals qualified to become our directors and in determining the composition of the Board and its committees. The Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for, among other things:\n\u00b7\nidentifying and recommending to the Board nominees for election or re-election to the Board, or for appointment to fill any vacancy;\n\u00b7\nselecting directors for appointment to committees of the Board; and\n\u00b7\noverseeing annual evaluation of the Board and its committees for the prior fiscal year.\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee has sole authority to retain and terminate any search firm that is to be used by the Company to assist in identifying director candidates, including sole authority to approve the firms\u2019 fees and other retention terms. The Governance and Nominating Committee may also form and delegate authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more members of the Governance and Nominating Committee.\nDirector Qualifications\nDirectors are responsible for overseeing the Company\u2019s business consistent with their fiduciary duty to shareholders. This significant responsibility requires highly-skilled individuals with various qualities, attributes and professional experience. The Board believes that there are general requirements for service on the Company\u2019s Board of Directors that are applicable to all directors and that there are other skills and experience that should be represented on the Board as a whole but not necessarily by each director. The Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board consider the qualifications of directors and director candidates individually and in the broader context of the Board\u2019s overall composition and the Company\u2019s current and future needs.\nQualifications for All Directors\nIn its assessment of each potential director candidate, including those recommended by shareholders, the Governance and Nominating Committee considers the nominee\u2019s judgment, integrity, experience, independence, understanding of the Company\u2019s business or other related industries and such other factors the Governance and Nominating Committee determines are pertinent in light of the current needs of the Board. The Governance and Nominating Committee also takes into account the ability of a director to devote the time and effort necessary to fulfill his or her responsibilities to the Company.\nThe Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee require that each director be a recognized person of high integrity with a proven record of success in his or her field. Each director must demonstrate innovative thinking, familiarity with and respect for corporate governance requirements and practices, an appreciation of multiple cultures and a commitment to sustainability and to dealing responsibly with social issues. In addition to the qualifications required of all directors, the Board assesses intangible qualities including the individual\u2019s ability to ask difficult questions and, simultaneously, to work collegially.\nThe Board does not have a specific diversity policy, but considers diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, age, cultural background and professional experiences in evaluating candidates for Board membership. Diversity is important because a variety of points of view contribute to a more effective decision-making process.\nQualifications, Attributes, Skills and Experience to be represented on the Board as a Whole\nThe Board has identified particular qualifications, attributes, skills and experience that are important to be represented on the Board as a whole, in light of the Company\u2019s current needs and business priorities. The Company\u2019s services are performed in areas of future growth located outside of the United States. Accordingly, the Board believes that international experience or specific knowledge of key geographic growth areas and diversity of professional experiences should be represented on the Board. In addition, the Company\u2019s business is multifaceted and involves complex financial transactions. Therefore, the Board believes that the Board should include some directors with a high level of financial literacy and some directors who possess relevant business experience as a Chief Executive Officer or President. Our business involves complex technologies in a highly specialized industry. Therefore, the Board believes that extensive knowledge of the Company\u2019s business and industry should be represented on the Board.\nSummary of Qualifications of Current Directors\nSet forth below is a narrative disclosure that summarizes some of the specific qualifications, attributes, skills and experiences of our directors.

(\u201cTyler\u201d) is a major provider of integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector, with a focus on local governments. We partner with clients to make government more accessible to the public, more responsive to the needs of citizens and more efficient in its operations. We have a broad line of software solutions and services to address the information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) needs of major areas of operations for cities, counties, schools and other government entities. A majority of our clients have our software installed in-house. For clients who prefer not to physically acquire the software and hardware, most of our software applications can be delivered as software as a service (\u201cSaaS\u201d), which primarily utilize the Tyler private cloud. We provide professional IT services to our clients, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training and, at times, product modifications. In addition, we are the nation\u2019s largest provider of outsourced property appraisal services for taxing jurisdictions. We also provide continuing client support services to ensure product performance and reliability, which provides us with long-term client relationships and a significant base of recurring maintenance revenue. In addition, we provide electronic document filing (\u201ce-filing\u201d) solutions, which simplify the filing and management of court documents.\nMARKET OVERVIEW\nThe state and local government market is one of the largest and most decentralized IT markets in the country, consisting of all 50 states, approximately 3,000 counties, 36,000 cities and towns and 12,900 school districts. This market is also comprised of approximately 38,000 special districts and other agencies, each with specialized delegated responsibilities and unique information management requirements.\nTraditionally, local government bodies and agencies performed state-mandated duties, including property assessment, record keeping, road maintenance, law enforcement, administration of election and judicial functions, and the provision of welfare assistance. Today, a host of emerging and urgent issues are confronting local governments, each of which demands a service response. These areas include criminal justice and corrections, administration and finance, public safety, health and human services, planning, regulatory and maintenance and records and document management. Transfers of responsibility from the federal and state governments to county and municipal governments and agencies in these and other areas also place additional service and financial requirements on these local government units. In addition, constituents of local governments are increasingly demanding improved service and better access to information from public entities. As a result, local governments recognize the increasing value of information management systems and services to, among other things, improve revenue collection, provide increased access to information, and streamline delivery of services to their constituents. Local government bodies are now recognizing that \u201ce-government\u201d is an additional responsibility for community development. From integrated tax systems to integrated civil and criminal justice information systems, many counties and cities have benefited significantly from the implementation of jurisdiction-wide systems that allow different agencies or government offices to share data and provide a more comprehensive approach to information management. Many city and county governmental agencies also have unique individual information management requirements, which must be tailored to the specific functions of each particular office.\nMany local governments also have difficulties attracting and retaining the staff necessary to support their IT functions. As a result, they seek to establish long-term relationships with reliable providers of high quality IT products and services such as Tyler.\nAlthough local governments often face budgetary constraints in their operations, their primary revenue sources are usually property taxes, and to a lesser extent, utility billings and other fees, which historically tend to be relatively stable. In addition, the acquisition of new technology typically enables local governments to operate more efficiently, and often provides a measurable return on investment that justifies the purchase of software and related services.\nGartner, Inc., a leading information technology research and advisory company, estimates that state and local government application and vertical specific software spending will grow from $19.5 billion in 2021 to $25.1 billion in 2024. The professional services and support segments of the market are expected to expand from $29.0 billion in 2021 to $33.5 billion in 2024. Application and vertical specific software sales in the primary and secondary education segments of the market is expected to expand from $3.0 billion in 2021 to $4.3 billion in 2024 while professional services and support are expected to grow from $3.0 billion in 2021 to $3.7 billion in 2024.\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nWe provide a comprehensive and flexible suite of products and services that addresses the information technology needs of cities, counties, schools and other local government entities. We derive our revenues from five primary sources:\n\u2022Sales of software licenses and royalties\n\u2022Subscription-based arrangements\n\u2022Software services\n\u2022Maintenance and support\n\u2022Appraisal services\nWe design, develop, market and support a broad range of software solutions to serve mission-critical \u201cback-office\u201d functions of the public sector with focus on local governments. Many of our software applications include Internet-accessible solutions that allow for real-time public access to a variety of information or that allow the public to transact business with local governments via the Internet. Our software solutions and services are generally grouped in eight major areas:\n\u2022Financial Management and Education\n\u2022Courts and Justice\n\u2022Public Safety\n\u2022Property Appraisal and Tax\n\u2022Planning, Regulatory and Maintenance\n\u2022Land and Vital Records Management\n\u2022Data and Insights\n\u2022Platform Technologies\nEach of our core software systems consists of several fully integrated applications. For clients who acquire software for use on premises, we generally license our systems under standard perpetual license agreements that provide the client with a fully paid, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use the software. In some of the product areas, such as financial management and education and property appraisal and tax, we offer multiple solutions designed to meet the needs of different sized governments.\nWe also offer SaaS arrangements, which generally utilize the Tyler private cloud, for clients who do not wish to maintain, update and operate these systems or to make up-front capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies. For these clients, the software and client data are hosted at our data centers or at third-party locations, and clients typically sign multi-year contracts for these subscription-based services.\nHistorically, we have had a greater proportion of our annual revenues in the second half of our fiscal year due to governmental budget and spending cycles and the timing of system implementations for clients desiring to \u201cgo live\u201d at the beginning of the calendar year.\nA description of our suites of products and services follows:\nSoftware Licenses\nFinancial Management and Education\nOur financial management and education solutions are enterprise resource planning systems for local governments, which integrate information across all facets of a client organization.

Our solutions help eliminate duplicate data entry, promote more effective business procedures, and improve efficiency across the entire justice process.\nOur unified court case management system is designed to automate the tracking and management of information involved in all case types, including criminal, traffic, civil, family, probate and juvenile courts. It also tracks the status of cases, processes fines and fees and generates the specialized judgment and sentencing documents, notices and forms required in the court process. Documents received by the court can be scanned into the electronic case file and easily retrieved for viewing. Documents generated by the court can be electronically signed and automatically attached to the electronic case file. Additional modules automate the management of court calendars, coordinate judges' schedules and generate court dockets. Our targeted courtroom technologies allow courts to rapidly review calendars, cases and view documents in the courtroom. Courts may also take advantage of our related jury management system. We also offer a solution for online dispute resolution that automates the flow and resolution of common and historically time-consuming disputes including debt, landlord, tenant, small claims, child custody and other case types.\nOur court and law enforcement systems allow the public to access, via the Internet, a variety of information, including non-confidential criminal and civil court records, jail booking and release information, bond and bondsmen information, and court calendars and dockets. In addition, our systems allow cities and counties to accept payments for traffic and parking tickets over the Internet, with a seamless and automatic interface to back-office justice and financial systems.\nOur prosecutor system enables state attorney offices to track and manage criminal cases, including detailed victim information and private case notes. Investigative reports and charging instrument documents can be generated and stored for later viewing. Prosecutors can schedule and record the outcome of grand jury hearings. When integrated with the court system, prosecutors can view the electronic case file and related documents, as well as manage witness lists and subpoenas needed for court hearings.\nOur supervision system allows pre-trial and probation offices to manage offender caseloads. Supervision officers can track contact schedules, risk/needs assessments and reassessments, detailed drug test results, employment histories, compliance with conditions and payments of fees and restitution. Documents and forms, like pre-sentence investigations or revocation orders, can be generated and stored for easy viewing. When integrated with the jail and court systems, supervision officers obtain easy access and quick notification of offenders that have court hearings scheduled, are arrested locally, and have new warrants issued.\nWe also offer a court case management solution that automates and tracks all aspects of municipal courts and offices. It is a fully integrated, graphical application that provides effective case management, document processing and cash/bond management. This system complies with all state reporting and conviction reports and includes electronic reporting and also integrates with certain of our financial management solutions and public safety solutions.\nPublic Safety\nOur public safety software is a fully unified and comprehensive solution for law enforcement, fire and EMS, including 911 / computer aided dispatch (\u201cCAD\u201d), records management, mobile computing, corrections management, Web-based information sharing and decision support. The modules are fully integrated, utilizing a common database and providing full functionality between modules, reducing data entry. The software provides fast, efficient dispatching, and quick access to records, reports and actionable information from an agency\u2019s database.\nOur 911 / CAD solutions provide real-time, critical response dispatch functions in either single- or multi-jurisdictional environments. When integrated with our records management software, a vital link exists between dispatch and the most comprehensive records database available. Within seconds, the dispatch operator and the officer in the field can access critical information, such as prior incidents and outstanding warrants, increasing officer knowledge and safety. The solutions offer strong geographic information systems integration to help dispatchers quickly locate and send the best response during an emergency. Our 911 / CAD solutions dramatically improve performance, response time and unit safety.\nOur records management solutions for law enforcement and fire track statistical, operational, investigative and management data for inquiry and reporting. The systems create an efficient case processing workflow and help solve crimes with an accessible database that maintains central files on people, places, property, vehicles and criminal activity. Our public safety records management solutions enable easy access to information and simplify reporting.\nOur mobile computing solutions for law enforcement and fire provide instant access to local, state, regional and federal databases via mobile devices. Officers and firefighters can experience the benefits of obtaining critical, real-time information in the field, while saving time by preparing reports directly in their vehicles.\nOur jail management systems document and manage information that meets the requirements of a modern jail facility. This includes the booking and housing of persons in custody, supervising defendants on a pre-trial release, maintaining offenders sentenced to local incarceration and billing other agencies for housing inmates. Searching, reporting and tracking features are integrated, allowing reliable, up-to-date access to current arrest and incarceration data, including digital mug shots. Our systems also provide warrant checks for visitors or book-ins, inmate classification and risk assessment, commissary, property and medical processing, automation of statistics, and state and federal reporting.\nOur civil processing solutions manage civil process needs from document receipt through service, payment process and final closeout. We also have a mobile electronic citation solution through which law enforcement officers can easily enter citation information in a mobile device, which is automatically uploaded into the court or public safety records management systems, rather than hand-writing citations that must be re-entered into the systems.\nProperty Appraisal and Tax\nWe provide systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal property, including record keeping, mass appraisal, inquiry and protest tracking, appraisal and tax roll generation, tax statement processing, and electronic state-level reporting. These systems are image and video-enabled to facilitate the storage of and access to the many property-related documents and for the online storage of digital photographs of properties for use in defending values in protest situations. Other related tax applications are available for agencies that bill and collect taxes, including cities, counties, school tax offices, and special taxing and collection agencies. These systems support billing, collections, lock box operations, mortgage company electronic payments, and various reporting requirements.\nPlanning, Regulatory and Maintenance\nOur planning, regulatory and maintenance software solutions are designed for public sector agencies such as community development, planning, building, code enforcement, tax and revenues, public works, transportation, land control, environmental, fire safety, storm water management, regulatory controls and engineering. These solutions help public sector agencies better manage their day-to-day business functions while streamlining and automating the many aspects of their land management, permitting and planning systems. Our mobile solutions extend automation to the field and Web access brings online services to citizens 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\nLand and Vital Records Management\nWe also offer a number of specialized software applications designed to help local governments enhance and automate operations involving records and document management. These systems record, scan and index information for the many documents maintained by local governments, such as deeds, mortgages, liens, UCC financing statements and vital records (birth, death and marriage certificates). These applications include fully integrated imaging systems with batch and scan processing capabilities and fully integrated receipting and cashiering systems, as well as Web-enabled public access.\nOur content management solutions allow state and local governments and school districts to capture, deliver, manage and archive electronic information. These solutions streamline the flow of digital information throughout the organization to increase efficiency by transforming paper forms and documents into electronic images that drive key business processes.\nData and Insights\nOur data and insights solutions make existing government data discoverable, usable, and actionable for government workers and the people they serve. The data and insights solution includes a data-as-a-service platform and cloud applications for open data and citizen engagement, exclusively for city, county, state, and federal government organizations. Our data and insights solutions allow government to analyze, visualize, and securely share data across multiple departments and programs. These solutions deliver data-driven innovation and cost-savings by bringing together disparate systems and leveraging the cloud to dramatically enhance the effectiveness of government programs, to improve quality of life for residents, to positively impact local economies, and to achieve excellence in government operations.\nPlatform Technologies\nWe offer a low-code application development platform solution for case management and business process management. Whether based on premises or in the cloud, its Data-First\u2122 approach allows the application to be implemented immediately and configured continuously, enabling clients to get to work quickly while keeping costs low. Our low code application platform allows government agencies the ability to track, collaborate, and report on the data that drives activities forward.\nSubscription-Based Services\nSubscription-based revenue is primarily derived from our SaaS arrangements, which generally utilize the Tyler private cloud, as well as our transaction-based offerings such as e-filing solutions, online dispute resolution solutions, and online payment services.\nWe are able to provide the majority of our software products through our SaaS model. The clients who choose this model typically do not wish to maintain, update and operate these systems or make up-front capital expenditures to implement these advanced technologies. The contract terms for these arrangements range from one to 10 years but are typically contracted for initial periods of three to five years. The majority of our SaaS or hosting arrangements include additional professional services as well as maintenance and support services. In certain arrangements, the client may also acquire a license to the software.\nAs part of our subscription-based services, we provide e-filing solutions that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices. Revenues for e-filing are included in subscription-based revenues and are derived from transaction fees and in some cases, fixed fee arrangements. Other transaction-based fees primarily relate to online payment services, which are offered with the assistance of third-party vendors, and online dispute resolution solutions.\nSoftware Services\nWe provide a variety of professional services to clients who utilize our software products. Virtually all of our clients contract with us for installation, training, and data conversion services in connection with their implementation of Tyler\u2019s software solutions. The complete implementation process for a typical system includes planning, design, data conversion, set-up and testing. At the culmination of the implementation process, a data implementation team is generally onsite at the client\u2019s facility to ensure the smooth go-live with the new system. Implementation fees are charged separately to clients on either a fixed-fee or hourly charge basis, depending on the contract.\nBoth in connection with the installation of new systems and on an ongoing basis, we provide extensive training services and programs related to our products and services. Training can be provided in our training centers, onsite at clients\u2019 locations, or at meetings and conferences and can be customized to meet clients\u2019 requirements. The vast majority of our clients contract with us for training services, both to improve their employees\u2019 proficiency and productivity and to fully utilize the functionality of our systems. Training services are generally billed on an hourly or daily basis, along with travel and other expenses.\nMaintenance and Support\nFollowing the implementation of our software systems, we provide ongoing software support services to assist our clients in operating the systems and to periodically update the software. Support is provided to clients over the phone or via the Web through help desks staffed by our client support representatives. For more complicated issues, our staff, with the clients' permission, can log on to clients\u2019 systems remotely. We maintain our clients\u2019 software largely through releases that contain improvements and incremental additions of features and functionality, along with updates necessary because of legislative or regulatory changes.\nVirtually all of our software clients contract with us for maintenance and support, which provides us with a significant source of recurring revenue. We generally provide maintenance and support for our on-premises clients under annual, or in some cases, multi-year contracts, with a typical fee based on a percentage of the software product\u2019s license fee. These fees can generally be increased on renewal and may also increase as new license fees increase. Maintenance and support fees are generally paid annually in advance. Most maintenance contracts automatically renew unless the client or Tyler gives notice of termination prior to expiration. Similar support is provided to our SaaS clients and is included in their subscription fees, which are classified as subscription-based revenues.\nAppraisal Services\nWe are the nation\u2019s largest provider of property appraisal outsourcing services for local government taxing authorities. These services include:\n\u2022The physical inspection of commercial and residential properties\n\u2022Data collection and processing\n\u2022Sophisticated computer analyses for property valuation\n\u2022Preparation of tax rolls\n\u2022Community education regarding the assessment process\n\u2022Arbitration between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction\nLocal government taxing authorities normally reappraise properties from time to time to update values for tax assessment purposes and to maintain equity in the taxing process. In some jurisdictions, law mandates reassessment cycles; in others, they are discretionary. While some taxing jurisdictions perform reappraisals in-house, many local governments outsource this function because of its cyclical nature and because of the specialized knowledge and expertise requirements associated with it. Our appraisal services business unit has operated in this business since 1938.\nIn some instances, we also provide property tax and/or appraisal software products in connection with appraisal outsourcing projects, while other clients may only engage us to provide appraisal services. Appraisal outsourcing services are somewhat seasonal in nature to the extent that winter weather conditions reduce the productivity of data collection activities in connection with those projects.\nSTRATEGY\nOur objective is to grow our revenue and earnings organically, supplemented by focused strategic acquisitions. The key components of our business strategy are to:\n\u2022Provide high quality, value-added products and services to our clients. We compete on the basis of, among other things, delivering to clients our deep domain expertise in local government operations through the highest value products and services in the market. We believe we have achieved a reputation as a premium product and service provider to the local government market.\n\u2022Continue to expand our product and service offerings. While we already have what we believe to be the broadest line of software products for local governments, we continually upgrade our core software applications and expand our complementary product and service offerings to respond to technological advancements and the changing needs of our clients. In 2010, we began providing e-filing for courts and law offices, which simplifies the filing and management of court related documents. We believe revenue from e-filing solutions will continue to grow over time as more local and state governments mandate electronic document filings. We also offer solutions that allow the public to access data and conduct transactions with local governments, such as paying traffic tickets, property taxes and utility bills online. We believe that the addition of such features enhances the market appeal of our core products. We have also broadened our offerings of consulting and business process reengineering services.\n\u2022Expand our client base. We seek to establish long-term relationships with new clients primarily through our sales and marketing efforts. While we currently have clients in all 50 states, Canada, the Caribbean, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other international locations, not all of our solutions have achieved nationwide geographic penetration. We intend to continue to expand into new geographic markets by adding sales staff and targeting marketing efforts by solutions in those areas. We also intend to continue to expand our customer base to include more large governments. While our traditional market focus has primarily been on small and mid-sized governments, our increased size and market presence, together with the technological advances and improved scalability of certain of our solutions, are allowing us to achieve increasing success in selling to larger clients. We also expect to expand our presence in international markets by leveraging our leadership position in the United States through the disciplined pursuit of selected opportunities in other countries.\n\u2022Expand our existing client relationships. Our existing customer base offers significant opportunities for additional sales of solutions and services that we currently offer, but that existing clients do not fully utilize. Add-on sales to existing clients typically involve lower sales and marketing expenses than sales to new clients.\n\u2022Grow recurring revenues. We have a large recurring revenue base from maintenance and support and subscription-based services, which generated revenues of $818.2 million, or 73% of total revenues, in 2020. We have historically experienced very low customer turnover (approximately 2% annually) and recurring revenues continue to grow as the installed customer base increases. Subscription-based revenues have been our fastest growing revenue category over the past five years, increasing from $142.7 million in 2016 to $350.6 million in 2020.\n\u2022Maximize economies of scale and take advantage of financial leverage in our business. We seek to build and maintain a larger client base to create economies of scale, enabling us to provide value-added products and services to our clients while expanding our operating margins. Because we sell primarily \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d software, increased sales of the same solutions result in incrementally higher gross margins. In addition, we believe that we have a marketing and administrative infrastructure in place that can be leveraged to accommodate significant long-term growth without proportionately increasing selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\u2022Attract and retain highly qualified employees. We believe that the depth and quality of our management and staff is one of our significant strengths, and that the ability to retain such employees is crucial to our continued growth and success. We believe that our stable management team, financial strength and growth opportunities, as well as our leadership position in the local government market, enhance our attractiveness as an employer for highly skilled employees.\n\u2022Pursue selected strategic acquisitions. While we expect to primarily grow internally, from time to time we selectively pursue strategic acquisitions that provide us with one or more of the following:\n\u2022New products and services to complement our existing offerings\n\u2022Entry into new markets related to the public sector\n\u2022New clients and/or geographic expansion\n\u2022Establish strategic alliances. In October 2019, we announced a strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\") for cloud hosting services. This agreement brings together Tyler, the nation's largest software company exclusively focused on the public sector, and AWS, the broadest and deepest cloud platform. Specifically, the agreement with AWS provides the framework for development, training and collaboration in order to support next-generation applications that have the scalability, resiliency, and security AWS offers. It will assist Tyler in accelerating innovation and the development of strategic initiatives. These initiatives will bring the most advanced cloud-native services to Tyler clients, improving the flow of information and providing a better experience for state, local, and federal governments.\nSALES, MARKETING AND CLIENTS\nWe market our products and services through direct sales and marketing personnel located throughout the United States. Other in-house sales staff focus on add-on sales, professional services and support.\nSales of new systems are typically generated from referrals from other government offices or departments within a county or municipality, referrals from other local governments, relationships established between sales representatives and county or local officials, contacts at trade shows, direct mailings, and direct contact from prospects already familiar with us. We are active in numerous national, state, county, and local government associations, and participate in annual meetings, trade shows, and educational events.\nClients consist primarily of federal, state, county and municipal agencies, school districts and other local government offices. In counties, clients include the auditor, treasurer, tax assessor/collector, county clerk, district clerk, county and district court judges, probation officers, sheriff, and county appraiser. At municipal government sites, clients include directors from various departments, including administration, finance, utilities, public works, code enforcement, personnel, purchasing, taxation, municipal court and police. Contracts for software products and services are generally implemented over periods of three months to one year, although some complex implementations may span multiple years, with annually renewing maintenance and support update agreements thereafter. Although either the client or we can terminate these agreements, historically almost all support and maintenance agreements are automatically renewed annually. During 2020, approximately 42% of our revenue was attributable to ongoing support and maintenance agreements.\nCOMPETITION\nWe compete with numerous local, regional, and national firms that provide or offer some or many of the same solutions and services that we provide. Many of these competitors are smaller companies that may be able to offer less expensive solutions than ours. Many of these firms operate within a specific geographic area and/or in a narrow product or service niche. We also compete with national firms, some of which have greater financial and technical resources than we do, including Oracle Corporation, Infor, SAP AG, Workday, Inc., CentralSquare Technologies, Thomson Reuters Corporation, Motorola Solutions, Inc., Axon Enterprise, Inc., and Constellation Software, Inc. In addition, we sometimes compete with consulting and systems integration firms, which develop custom systems, primarily for larger governments. We also occasionally compete with central internal information service departments of local governments, which requires us to persuade the end-user department to discontinue service by its own personnel and outsource the service to us.\nWe compete on a variety of factors, including price, service, name recognition, reputation, technological capabilities, and the ability to modify existing products and services to accommodate the individual requirements of the client. Our ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments is often a competitive advantage. Governmental units often are required to seek competitive proposals through a request for proposal process and some prospective clients use consultants to assist them with the proposal and vendor selection process.\nSUPPLIERS\nSubstantially all of the computers, peripherals, printers, scanners, operating system software, office automation software, and other equipment necessary for the implementation and provision of our software systems and services are presently available from several third-party sources. Hardware is purchased on original equipment manufacturer or distributor terms at discounts from retail. We have not experienced any significant supply problems.\nBACKLOG\nAt December 31, 2020, our revenue backlog was approximately $1.59 billion, compared to $1.46 billion at December 31, 2019. The backlog generally represents signed contracts under which the revenue has not been recognized as of year-end. Approximately $780.0 million, or 49%, of the backlog is expected to be recognized during 2021.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, AND LICENSES\nWe regard certain features of our internal operations, software, and documentation as confidential and proprietary and rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary intellectual property. We generally do not rely on patents. We believe that, due to the rapid rate of technological change in the computer software industry, trade secrets and copyright protection are less significant than factors such as knowledge, ability and experience of our employees, frequent product enhancements, and timeliness and quality of support services. We typically license our software products under non-exclusive license agreements, which are generally non-transferable and have a perpetual term.\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nHuman Capital\nThe strength of our team is one of the most significant contributors to our success in empowering the public sector to create smarter, safer, and stronger communities. Our effectiveness in attracting, developing, engaging and retaining talented team members, many of whom spend the majority of their careers at Tyler serving our public sector clients, demonstrates our commitment to providing a welcoming and safe workplace, with equitable compensation, benefits and opportunities for our team members to continually grow and develop their careers within Tyler.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 5,500 team members. Approximately 250 of these team members are located in Canada and the Philippines; the remainder work remotely in the U.S. or are based in one of our nearly 50 U.S. offices. No Tyler employees are represented by unions. We believe our efforts in managing and supporting our workforce are effective, as evidenced by current levels of applicants, team member tenure, and high levels of engagement reported through continuous survey feedback from Tyler team members. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our human capital management practices as the majority of our workforce pivoted to work remotely in March 2020. Our team quickly adjusted to remotely develop for, sell to, implement and support our public sector clients.\nAt the end of 2020, Tyler\u2019s U.S. workforce was 63% male and 37% female, and women represented 19% of Tyler\u2019s leadership. In the U.S. our workforce was comprised as follows: 76% White, 8% Asian, 4% Hispanic or Latino, 5% Black or African American, and 7% Other. For our U.S. leadership, the breakdown was 86% White, 5% Asian, 3% Hispanic or Latino, 3% Black or African American, and 3% Other. We define leadership as positions which are one or two levels removed from our CEO with management responsibility. Race and gender reporting are based on information provided by team members. Voluntary workforce turnover (rolling 12-month attrition) was 6.5% as of December 31, 2020. The average tenure of our team members is approximately seven years and approximately 27% of our employees have been employed by Tyler for more than ten years.\nInvestments in Talent\nWe are committed to providing Tyler team members with the training and resources necessary to continually strengthen their skills. Our talent assessment and development programs provide managers and employees with the resources needed to achieve career goals, build management skills and lead their teams. Our TylerU online training platform provides team members with opportunities for continuous learning, professional training and development.\nOversight and Management\nOur Human Resources organization is tasked with leading our organization in managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, talent management and development. Our executive team is responsible for periodically reviewing team member programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices. Management periodically reports to the Board and its committees human capital measures and results that guide how we attract, retain and develop a workforce to enable our business strategies.\nHealth & Safety\nWe invest in the well-being of Tyler team members and their families. We provide a range of offerings in support of mental and emotional, financial, and physical health and wellness - not only for our team members, but also for the family members who depend on them. The COVID-19 pandemic created stressful conditions in 2020. In response to the pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, including moving the vast majority of our employees to work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. In addition to safety protocols and the establishment of local site Return-To-Office teams, we:\na.Introduced enhanced mental health benefits and resources for team members and their families through our employee assistance programs in the U.S., Canada and the Philippines\nb.Covered telehealth visits for medical and mental health services at 100%\nc.Provided coverage of all COVID-19 testing and treatment under all Company medical plans at no cost to employees and dependents\nd.Provided unlimited paid time off for any team member who was awaiting or had received a positive COVID-19 test result or was unable to perform their duties from home, whether due to the nature of their work or a client request.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to monitor and improve the application of our hiring, retention, compensation and advancement processes for women and underrepresented populations across our workforce, including our team members of color, veterans and those who are LGBTQ. Our Women\u2019s Leadership Network, Veteran\u2019s Affinity groups, and local office diversity councils, among other programs, serve to enhance our inclusive and diverse culture. We continue to invest in recruiting diverse technical talent, in part through our partnership with the Ada Developer\u2019s Academy, a non-profit, tuition-free coding school for women and gender diverse adults.\nIn 2020, our diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts included focused DEI discussions at the executive and local team levels, assessment of DEI effectiveness across the HR lifecycle, hiring manager training, the development of a Women\u2019s Leadership Mentoring program, and support and advocacy for local DEI councils at Tyler. We encourage you to review our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report located at http://www.tylertech.com for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives.\nINTERNET WEBSITE AND AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC FILINGS\nWe file annual, quarterly, current and other reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act. You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC\u2019s Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-732-0330.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a comparison of our Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 and our Cash Flow discussion for the year ended December 2019, see \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 2019 as filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis document contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that are not historical in nature and typically address future or anticipated events, trends, expectations or beliefs with respect to our financial condition, results of operations or business. Forward-looking statements often contain words such as \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cforesees,\u201d \u201cforecasts,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201ccontinues,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201cmight,\u201d \u201ccould\u201d or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe our business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements. We believe there is a reasonable basis for our forward-looking statements, but they are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from the expectations and beliefs reflected in the forward-looking statements. We presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and beliefs: (1) the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its potential effects on the economic environment, our customers and our operations, as well as any changes to federal, state or local government laws, regulations or orders in connection with the pandemic; (2) changes in the budgets or regulatory environments of our clients, primarily local and state governments, that could negatively impact information technology spending; (3) disruption to our business and harm to our competitive position resulting from cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities; (4) our ability to protect client information from security breaches and provide uninterrupted operations of data centers; (5) our ability to achieve growth or operational synergies through the integration of acquired businesses, while avoiding unanticipated costs and disruptions to existing operations; (6) material portions of our business require the Internet infrastructure to be adequately maintained; (7) our ability to achieve our financial forecasts due to various factors, including project delays by our clients, reductions in transaction size, fewer transactions, delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for service agreements; (8) general economic, political and market conditions; (9) technological and market risks associated with the development of new products or services or of new versions of existing or acquired products or services; (10) competition in the industry in which we conduct business and the impact of competition on pricing, client retention and pressure for new products or services; (11) the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and dealing with the loss or retirement of key members of management or other key personnel; and (12) costs of compliance and any failure to comply with government and stock exchange regulations. A detailed discussion of these factors and other risks that affect our business are described in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise our forward-looking statements.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe provide integrated information management solutions and services for the public sector, with a focus on local governments. We develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the IT needs of cities, counties, schools and other local government entities. In addition, we provide professional IT services to our clients, including software and hardware installation, data conversion, training and for certain clients, product modifications, along with continuing maintenance and support for clients using our systems. We also provide subscription-based services such as software as a service (\u201cSaaS\u201d), which primarily utilize the Tyler private cloud, and electronic document filing solutions (\u201ce-filing\u201d), which simplify the filing and management of court related documents. Revenues for e-filing are derived from transaction fees and, in some cases, fixed fee arrangements. Other transaction-based fees primary relate to online payment services. We also provide property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions.\nOur products generally automate eight major functional areas: (1) financial management and education, (2) courts and justice, (3) public safety, (4) property appraisal and tax, (5) planning, regulatory and maintenance, (6) land and vital records management, (7) data and insights and (8) platform technologies. We report our results in two segments. The Enterprise Software (\"ES\") segment provides public sector entities with software systems and services to meet their information technology and automation needs for mission-critical \u201cback-office\u201d functions such as: financial management and education, courts and justice, public safety, planning, regulatory and maintenance, data and insights and platform technologies. The Appraisal and Tax (\u201cA&T\u201d) segment provides systems and software that automate the appraisal and assessment of real and personal property, land and vital records management as well as property appraisal outsourcing services for local governments and taxing authorities. Property appraisal outsourcing services include: the physical inspection of commercial and residential properties; data collection and processing; computer analysis for property valuation; preparation of tax rolls; community education; and arbitration between taxpayers and the assessing jurisdiction.\nAs of January 1, 2020, the land and vital records management business unit, which was previously reported in the ES segment, was moved to the A&T segment to reflect changes in the way in which management makes operating decisions, allocates resources, and manages the growth and profitability of the Company. Prior year amounts for the ES and A&T segments have been adjusted to reflect the segment change. See Note 14 - \"Segment and Related Information\" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, total revenues increased 2.8% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, total revenues increased 1.4% compared to prior year. Revenues from acquisitions contributed 1.4% of growth for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nSubscriptions revenue grew 18.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, due to a gradual shift toward cloud-based, software as a service business, as well as continued strong growth in our transaction-based revenues from online payments and e-filing revenues from courts. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, subscriptions revenue increased 17.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nOur backlog at December 31, 2020 was $1.59 billion, a 9.4% increase from last year.\nWe monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance. These indicators include the following:\nRevenues - We derive our revenues from five primary sources: sale of software licenses and royalties; subscription-based arrangements; software services; maintenance; and appraisal services. Subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources and comprised approximately 73.3% of our revenue in 2020. The number of new SaaS clients and the number of existing clients who convert from our traditional software arrangements to our SaaS model are a significant driver of our revenue growth, together with new software license sales and maintenance rate increases. In addition, we also monitor our customer base and churn as we historically have experienced very low customer turnover. During 2020, based on our number of customers, turnover was approximately 2%.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margins - Our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation, subscription-based services, maintenance and support, and appraisal services to our clients. We can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base, especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost, such as software licenses and royalties, subscription-based services, and maintenance and support. Our appraisal projects are cyclical in nature, and we often employ appraisal personnel on a short-term basis to coincide with the life of a project. As of December 31, 2020, our total employee count increased to 5,536 from 5,368 at December 31, 2019.\nSelling, General and Administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) Expenses - The primary components of SG&A expenses are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions, share-based compensation expense, marketing expense, rent and professional fees. Sales commissions typically fluctuate with revenues and share-based compensation expense generally increases as the market price of our stock increases. Other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues.\nLiquidity and Cash Flows - The primary driver of our cash flows is net income. Uses of cash include acquisitions, capital investments in property and equipment and discretionary purchases of treasury stock. Our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from clients in advance of revenue being earned. In recent years, we have also received significant amounts of cash from employees exercising stock options and contributing to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nBalance Sheet - Cash, accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the world and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. While we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our results from operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures and associated compliance, the current environment has negatively impacted our revenues for fiscal year 2020.\nBecause an increasing portion of our revenues are recurring, the effect of COVID-19 on our results of operations may also not be fully reflected for some time. We continue to see some impact on our business in the near term with delays in government procurement processes and uncertainty around public sector budgets, as well as delays in implementations caused by travel restrictions, closed offices, or clients shifting focus to more pressing issues. We have addressed those challenges through adapting the way we do business - encouraging web and video conferencing, conducting virtual sales demonstrations and delivering professional services remotely.\nOur priorities during this crisis are protecting the health and safety of our employees and our clients. Our IT systems and applications support a remote workforce. Prior to the pandemic, many of our employees worked remotely. In response to the pandemic, we encouraged all employees who are able to do so to work from home, equipping them with resources necessary to continue uninterrupted. We were able to transition the vast majority of our employees to this work-from-home posture. This reduces the number of team members in our offices to those uniquely needed for essential on-site services, such as network operations support staff, and allows for \u201csocial distancing\u201d as directed by the Centers for Disease Control (\"CDC\").\nThe pandemic has delayed some government procurement processes and is expected to impact our ability to complete certain implementations, negatively impacting our revenue. It could also negatively impact the timing of client payments to us. We continue to monitor these trends in order to respond to the ever-changing impact of COVID-19 on our clients and Tyler\u2019s operations.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lower revenues from software licenses, software services, appraisal services, and other revenues. Lower software licenses compared to prior periods are attributed to slower sales cycles as government procurement processes are delayed and contract signings have been pushed to future periods. Software services and appraisal services revenue declines are attributed to delays in implementations caused by travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders in effect during the period. Other revenues were lower compared to prior periods primarily as a result of the cancellation of our 2020 Connect user conference. Lower revenues compared to prior periods were offset by cost savings attributed to lower spend on travel, user conferences and trade show expenses, health claims and other employee-related expenses. If and as travel restrictions are relaxed, we expect software services and appraisal services revenues to increase as the limited number of our clients who require that all or a portion of their services be delivered onsite will be able to receive those services. Also, we are adapting by changing the way we do business, encouraging web and video conferencing, conducting virtual sales demonstrations and delivering professional services remotely, which result in increases in staff utilization rates and billable time.\nRecurring revenues from subscriptions and maintenance comprised 73.3% of our total consolidated revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and include transaction-based revenue streams such as e-filing and online payments. As of December 31, 2020, we had $758.5 million in cash and investments and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. We also have substantial additional liquidity available through our undrawn $400 million credit facility, which can be expanded through an accordion feature. During the second quarter of 2020, we completed our annual assessment of goodwill which did not result in an impairment charge. Since our assessment in the second quarter of 2020, we have recorded no impairment to goodwill as no triggering events or changes in circumstances occurred as of period-end. No impairments of other assets were recorded as of the balance sheet date as no triggering events or changes in circumstances indicating a potential impairment have occurred as of period-end to require such an impairment; however, due to significant uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and market conditions, management\u2019s judgment regarding this could change in the future.\nSecurity Incident\nOn September 29, 2020, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K reporting a security incident (the \"Incident\") involving ransomware disrupting access to some of our internal IT systems and telephone systems. There is no evidence that the environments where we host client applications were affected, and our hosting services to those clients were not interrupted. There is also no evidence of malicious activity on client networks associated with the Incident. We contained the Incident and recovered from it, resuming normal operations with our clients. We will continue to deploy supplemental remediation efforts as necessary.\nAs part of our immediate response to the Incident, we (1) shut down points of access to external systems and began investigating and remediating the problem; (2) engaged outside IT security and forensics experts to conduct a detailed review and help securely restore affected systems; (3) implemented targeted monitoring systems to supplement the systems we already had in place; and (4) notified law enforcement. We are have cooperated with their investigation throughout.\nWe promptly notified our clients of the Incident and provided timely updates to our clients through direct communications and updates to our website.\nAlthough we believe we have contained and recovered from the Incident, and that we have taken and will continue to take appropriate remediation steps, we are subject to risk and uncertainties as a result of the Incident. We believe we are in the final phases of our investigation, but there can be no assurance as to what the ongoing impact of the Incident will be, if any. The Incident caused an interruption in parts of our business. We estimate that as a result of the Incident, revenue (primarily software services) for the year ended December 31, 2020 was reduced by approximately $1.5 million; however, insurance reimbursements pertaining to lost revenue represent a contingent gain and any recovery of these revenues will be recorded when received. We incurred $4.2 million in costs associated with the Incident as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we have recorded $1.1 million of accrued insurance recoveries and received $2.4 million of insurance recoveries related to the Incident. The recorded costs consisted primarily of payments to third-party service providers and consultants, including legal fees, and enhancements to our cybersecurity measures. It is expected that we will continue to incur costs related to our response, remediation, and investigatory efforts relating to the Incident. We maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is adequate.\nRecent adoption of new accounting pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d). ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, available for-sale debt securities, held-to-maturity debt securities and loans, and requires entities to use a new forward-looking expected loss model that will result in the earlier recognition of an allowance for losses. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. Entities apply the standard\u2019s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. As of January 1, 2020, we adopted the new standard with no material impact of credit losses to our trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities and retained earnings included in our consolidated financial statements.\nOn January 26, 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The new standard eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. This standard is effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and the standard was adopted and applied prospectively by the Company as of January 1, 2020, but it did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures.\nRecent Accounting Guidance not yet Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, (\"ASU 2019-12\") which simplifies the accounting for income taxes, eliminates certain exceptions within ASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting entities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Most amendments within the standard are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. We do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nOutlook\nThe local government software market continues to be active, and our backlog at December 31, 2020 reached $1.59 billion, a 9.4% increase from the prior year. We expect to continue to achieve solid growth in revenue and earnings. With our strong financial position and cash flow, we plan to continue to make significant investments in product development to better position us to continue to expand our addressable market and strengthen our competitive position in the public sector software market over the long term.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues, cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and related disclosure of contingencies. The Notes to the Financial Statements included as part of this Annual Report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the progress toward completion methods of revenue recognition, estimated standalone selling price (\"SSP\") for distinct performance obligations, the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets, determination of share-based compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. We earn revenue from software licenses, royalties, subscription-based services, software services, post-contract customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d or \u201cmaintenance\u201d), hardware, and appraisal services. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n\u2022Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n\u2022Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022Determination of the transaction price\n\u2022Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n\u2022Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation\nMost of our software arrangements with customers contain multiple performance obligations that range from software licenses, installation, training, and consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs (services), hosting, and PCS. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately when they are distinct. We evaluate whether separate performance obligations can be distinct or should be accounted for as one performance obligation. Arrangements that include software services, such as training or installation, are evaluated to determine whether the customer can benefit from the services either on their own or together with other resources readily available to the customer and whether the services are separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. Many of our software arrangements involve \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d software. We recognize the revenue allocable to \"off-the-shelf\" software licenses and specified upgrades at a point in time when control of the software license transfers to the customer, unless the software is not considered distinct. We consider off-the-shelf software to be distinct when it can be added to an arrangement with minor changes in the underlying code, it can be used by the customer for the customer\u2019s purpose upon installation, and remaining services such as training are not considered highly interdependent or highly interrelated to the product's functionality.\nFor arrangements that involve significant production, modification or customization of the software, or where software services are otherwise not considered distinct, we recognize revenue over time by measuring progress-to-completion. We measure progress-to-completion primarily using labor hours incurred as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. These arrangements are often implemented over an extended period and occasionally require us to revise total cost estimates. Amounts recognized in revenue are calculated using the progress-to-completion measurement after giving effect to any changes in our cost estimates. Changes to total estimated contract costs, if any, are recorded in the period they are determined. Estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which we first determine that a loss is apparent. When software services are distinct, the fee allocable to the service element is recognized over the time we perform the services and is billed on a time and material or milestones basis.\nSubscription-based services consist of revenues derived from SaaS arrangements, which primarily utilize the Tyler private cloud, and electronic filing transactions. Revenue from subscription-based services is generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. For SaaS arrangements, we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer\u2019s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third-party to host the software. We allocate contract value to each performance obligation of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a distinct element based on estimated SSP. We recognize SaaS arrangements ratably over the term of the arrangement, which range from one to ten years, but are typically for a period of three to five years. For software services associated with certain SaaS arrangements, we have concluded that the services are not distinct, and we recognize the revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once we have provided the customer access to the software. We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nThe transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative SSP basis. We determine the SSP based on our overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, the applications sold, customer demographics, and the number and types of users within our contracts. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine SSP using the expected cost-plus margin approach. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for sales adjustments and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nTypically, the structure of our arrangements does not give rise to variable consideration. However, in those instances whereby variable consideration exists, we include in our estimates additional revenue for variable consideration when we believe we have an enforceable right, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable.\nWe maintain allowances for losses and sales adjustments, which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized. Since most of our customers are domestic governmental entities, we rarely incur a loss resulting from credit risk associated with the inability of a customer to make required payments. Events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for losses and sales adjustments may require revision include, but are not limited to, deterioration of a customer\u2019s financial condition, failure to manage our customer\u2019s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered, and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products. The allowance for losses and sales adjustments reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Our allowance for losses and sales adjustments of $9.3 million and $5.7 million at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, does not include provisions for credit losses. As of January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13 and primarily evaluated our historical experience with credit losses related to trade and other receivables. Because we have not experienced any historical credit losses with the majority of our clients, we have no basis to record a reserve for credit losses as defined by the standard.\nIn connection with certain of our contracts, we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date. Many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period. We review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue. In addition, we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue, which represents billings in excess of revenue earned. The majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period, generally one year. We also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product have not been met. On a periodic basis, we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill. Our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances, and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense, as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge. The cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value, with the excess allocated to goodwill. Accordingly, we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets, including software, customer related intangibles, trade name, leases and goodwill. These intangible assets (other than goodwill) are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment annually as of April 1st, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable. We begin with the qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the quantitative assessment described below. When testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively, we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized. The fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions. The assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. We evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization.\nDuring the second quarter, as part of our annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for all reporting units except for the data and insights reporting unit. As a result of these qualitative assessments, we determined that it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed; therefore, we did not perform a Step 1 quantitative impairment test. We did perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill of $75.7 million associated with our data and insights business unit and concluded no impairment existed as of our annual assessment date. For most of our reporting units, goodwill relates to a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result those units have fair values that substantially exceed their underlying carrying values. For other reporting units, in particular our platform technologies and data and insights business units, goodwill entirely relates to recently acquired businesses, and as a result those units do not have significant excess fair values over carrying values. The platform technologies and data and insights business units combined goodwill was $152.0 million, or 18%, of total goodwill as of December 31, 2020. Our annual goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge. During 2020, we have recorded no impairment to goodwill as no triggering events or changes in circumstances indicating a potential impairment have occurred as of period-end.\nDetermining the fair value of our reporting units involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Changes in market conditions or other factors outside of our control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause us to change key assumptions and our judgment about a reporting unit\u2019s prospects. Similarly, in a specific period, a reporting unit could significantly underperform relative to its historical or projected future operating results. Either situation could result in a meaningfully different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, and a consequent future impairment charge.\nAll intangible assets (other than goodwill) are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows. The assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; and reductions in growth rates. In addition, products, capabilities, or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non-competitive. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets. During 2020, we did not identify any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of our intangible assets may not be recoverable.\nShare-Based Compensation. We have a stock incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units to key employees, directors and non-employee consultants. We estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures, which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods. Forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data.\nWe estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock. Estimated option life is determined using the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to be outstanding based primarily on the options\u2019 vesting terms, remaining contractual life and the employees\u2019 expected exercise based on historical patterns. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, expected option life and forfeiture rates.\nANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OTHER\nThe following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nPercentage of Total Revenues\nYears Ended December 31,\n2020 2019 2018\nRevenues:\nSoftware licenses and royalties 6.5 % 9.2 % 10.0 %\nSubscriptions 31.4 27.3 23.6\nSoftware services 16.7 19.6 20.5\nMaintenance 41.9 39.6 41.1\nAppraisal services 1.9 2.2 2.3\nHardware and other 1.6 2.1 2.5\nTotal revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0\nOperating expenses:\nCost of software licenses, royalties and\nacquired software\n3.2 3.2 2.9\nCost of subscriptions, software services and\nmaintenance\n45.8 46.2 46.9\nCost of appraisal services 1.4 1.4 1.5\nCost of hardware and other 1.1 1.6 1.7\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 23.2 23.7 22.2\nResearch and development expense 7.9 7.5 6.8\nAmortization of customer and trade name\nintangibles\n1.9 2.0 1.7\nOperating income 15.5 14.4 16.3\nOther income, net 0.2 0.3 0.4\nIncome before income taxes 15.7 14.7 16.7\nIncome tax (benefit) provision (1.8) 1.2 0.9\nNet income 17.5 % 13.5 % 15.8 %\n2020 Compared to 2019\nRevenues\nOn February 28, 2019, we acquired all of the capital stock of MicroPact, a leading provider of COTS solutions, including entellitrak\u00ae, a low-code application development platform for case management and business process management used extensively in the public sector. The following table details revenue for MicroPact for the periods presented as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, which is included in our consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition:\n2020 2019\nRevenues:\nSoftware licenses and royalties $ 5,206 $ 8,737\nSubscriptions 10,823 7,472\nSoftware services 21,391 18,143\nMaintenance 39,701 28,642\nAppraisal services - -\nHardware and other 36 24\nTotal revenues $ 77,157 $ 63,018\nSoftware licenses and royalties.\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our software licenses and royalties revenue for the years ended December 31:\nChange\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019 $ %\nES $ 64,200 $ 90,808 $ (26,608) (29) %\nA&T 8,964 9,397 (433) (5)\nTotal software licenses and royalties revenue $ 73,164 $ 100,205 $ (27,041) (27) %\nSoftware licenses and royalties revenue decreased 27% compared to the prior year. The decline is primarily due to longer sales cycles attributed to our ERP, public safety, and appraisal software products as the impact of COVID-19 has slowed government procurement processes and some contract signings have been pushed to future periods. Software licenses revenue was also negatively impacted by delayed deliveries attributed to the IT security incident that occurred in late September 2020. Also contributing to the decline is the shift in the mix of new software contracts toward more subscription-based agreements compared to the prior year. Our total new client mix in 2020 was approximately 38% perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 62% subscription-based arrangements compared to total new client mix in 2019 of approximately 46% perpetual software license arrangements and approximately 54% subscription-based arrangements.\nAlthough the mix of new contracts between subscription-based and perpetual license arrangements may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year, we expect our longer-term software license growth rate to be negatively impacted by a growing number of customers choosing our subscription-based options, rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement. Subscription-based arrangements result in lower software license revenue in the initial year as compared to perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall revenue over the term of the contract.\nSubscriptions.\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our subscriptions revenue for the years ended December 31:\nChange\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019 $ %\nES $ 326,284 $ 279,282 $ 47,002 17 %\nA&T 24,364 17,070 7,294 43\nTotal subscriptions revenue $ 350,648 $ 296,352 $ 54,296 18 %\nSubscription-based revenue primarily consists of revenue derived from our SaaS arrangements, which generally utilize the Tyler private cloud. As part of our subscription-based services, we also provide electronic document filing solutions (\u201ce-filing\u201d) that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices. E-filing revenue is derived from transaction fees and fixed fee arrangements.\nSubscription-based revenue increased 18% compared to 2019. New SaaS clients as well as existing clients who converted to our SaaS model provided the majority of the subscription revenue increase. In 2020, we added 488 new SaaS clients and 157 existing clients elected to convert to our SaaS model. Also, transaction-based fees contributed $7.7 million to the increase in subscription revenue due to the increased volumes of online payments from utility billings and slightly increased e-filing services volumes in 2020.\nSoftware services.\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenue for the years ended December 31:\nChange\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019 $ %\nES $ 164,520 $ 179,865 $ (15,345) (9) %\nA&T 21,889 33,196 (11,307) (34)\nTotal software services revenue $ 186,409 $ 213,061 $ (26,652) (13) %\nSoftware services revenue primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with implementing our software, converting client data, training client personnel, custom development activities and consulting. New clients who purchase our proprietary software licenses or subscriptions generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services. Existing clients also periodically purchase additional training, consulting and minor programming services.\nSoftware services revenue decreased 13% compared to the prior year period. The decline in software services is due to delays in client implementations caused by COVID-19 travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders and a decline in billable travel revenue, as most services are now being delivered virtually rather than on-site. Software services revenue was also lower due to interruptions caused by the IT security incident that occurred in late September 2020. We estimate that as a result of the Incident, revenue (primarily software services) was reduced by approximately $1.5 million in 2020; however, insurance reimbursements pertaining to lost revenue represent a contingent gain and any recovery of these revenues will be recorded when received. Also contributing to the decline is the increase of clients selecting our cloud solutions instead of our on-premises license arrangements which typically require more professional services.\nMaintenance.\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenue for the years ended December 31:\nChange\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019 $ %\nES $ 429,224 $ 393,521 $ 35,703 9 %\nA&T 38,289 36,797 1,492 4\nTotal maintenance revenue $ 467,513 $ 430,318 $ 37,195 9 %\nWe provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain third-party software. Maintenance revenue grew 9% compared to the prior year. Maintenance revenue increased mainly due to contributions of maintenance revenue from recent acquisitions and completing the recognition of the majority of acquisition-related deferred maintenance revenue that was fair valued at rates below Tyler's average maintenance rate in prior periods. The remainder of the increase is attributed to annual maintenance rate increases and growth in our installed customer base from new software license sales, partially offset by attrition and clients converting from on-premises license arrangements to SaaS.\nAppraisal services.\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal services revenue for the years ended December 31:\nChange\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019 $ %\nES $ - $ - $ - - %\nA&T 21,127 23,479 (2,352) (10)\nTotal appraisal services revenue $ 21,127 $ 23,479 $ (2,352) (10) %\nIn 2020, appraisal services revenue decreased 10% compared to the prior year primarily due to the delays to several ongoing projects as a result of travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders related to COVID-19. The appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states.\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margins\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended December 31:\nChange\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019 $ %\nSoftware licenses and royalties $ 3,339 $ 3,938 $ (599) (15) %\nAcquired software 31,962 30,642 1,320 4\nSubscriptions, software services and maintenance 510,504 502,138 8,366 2\nAppraisal services 15,945 15,337 608 4\nHardware and other 12,401 17,472 (5,071) (29)\nTotal cost of revenues $ 574,151 $ 569,527 $ 4,624 1 %\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended December 31:\nGross margin percentage 2020 2019 Change\nSoftware licenses, royalties and acquired software 51.8 % 65.5 % (13.7) %\nSubscriptions, software services and maintenance 49.2 46.6 2.6\nAppraisal services 24.5 34.7 (10.2)\nHardware and other 30.3 24.1 6.2\nOverall gross margin 48.6 % 47.6 % 1.0 %\nSoftware licenses, royalties and acquired software. Cost of software licenses, royalties and acquired software is primarily comprised of amortization expense for acquired software and third-party software costs. We do not have any direct costs associated with royalties. The gross margin decrease of 13.7% is due to lower revenue from software licenses compared to the prior period.\nSubscriptions, software services and maintenance. Cost of subscriptions, software services and maintenance primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software, conversion of client data, training client personnel and support activities and various other services such as custom client development and on-going operation of SaaS and e-filing arrangements. In 2020, the subscriptions, software services and maintenance gross margin increased 2.6% compared to the prior year. Margins have increased primarily due to a reduction in software services revenues from reimbursable travel that has little to no margin, as well as improved utilization of our professional services staff resulting from the shift to virtual delivery of most implementation services, offset somewhat by the reduction in software services revenues as a result of the Incident in late September 2020. Our implementation and support staff grew by 131 employees since December 31, 2019, as we increased hiring to ensure that we are well-positioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business. Costs related to maintenance and various other services such as SaaS and e-filing typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leverage in the utilization of support and maintenance staff and economies of scale.\nAppraisal services. Appraisal services revenue comprised approximately 1.9% of total revenue. The appraisal services gross margin decreased 10.2% compared to 2019 due to lower staff utilization as a result of COVID-19 travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders in place during the current period. The appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states.\nOur 2020 blended gross margin increased 1.0% compared to 2019. The slight increase in overall gross margin is attributed to a higher revenue mix for subscription revenues compared to the prior year periods resulting in an increase in incremental margin related to subscriptions, software services and maintenance. Margins have also increased due a reduction in software services revenue from reimbursable travel that has little to no margin, as well as improved utilization of our professional services staff resulting from the shift to virtual delivery of most implementation services, offset somewhat by the reduction in software services revenues as a result of the Incident in late September 2020. Costs related to maintenance and various other services such as SaaS and e-filing typically grow at a slower rate than related revenue due to leveraging utilization of support and maintenance staff and economies of scale. In addition, the cancellation of our Connect user conference scheduled for April 2020 and the related elimination of approximately $6 million of revenues with no associated margin also had a positive impact on our overall gross margin. These increases in overall gross margins are partially offset by lower margins from software licenses due to lower software license revenue as well as lower staffing utilization attributable to appraisal services.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, travel, share-based compensation expense, commissions and related overhead costs for administrative and sales and marketing employees, as well as, professional fees, trade show activities, advertising costs and other marketing related costs. The following table sets forth a comparison of our SG&A expenses for the years ended December 31:\nChange\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019 $ %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses $ 259,561 $ 257,746 $ 1,815 1 %\nSG&A as a percentage of revenue was 23.2% in 2020 compared to 23.7% in 2019. SG&A expense increased approximately 1% compared to the prior year period. The increase in SG&A expense is attributed to increased stock compensation expense compared to the prior period. During 2020, stock compensation expense rose $4.3 million compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in share-based awards issued in connection with our stock compensation plan coupled with the higher fair value of each share-based award due to the increase in our stock price. These increases in SG&A were offset by lower bonus and commission expense as a result of lower\nsales, lower travel expenses associated with sales and marketing activities, including trade shows, as a result of COVID-19 travel restrictions, and lower health claim expenses during the current period.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits and related overhead costs associated with new product development. The following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended December 31:\nChange\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019 $ %\nResearch and development expense $ 88,363 $ 81,342 $ 7,021 9 %\nResearch and development expense consists mainly of costs associated with development of new products and technologies from which we do not currently generate significant revenue.\nResearch and development expense increased 9% in 2020 compared to the prior year period, mainly due to a number of new Tyler product development initiatives across our product suites, including increased investments in research and development at recently acquired businesses. To support these initiatives, our research and development staff grew by 38 since December 31, 2019.\nAmortization of Customer and Trade Name Intangibles\nAcquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software, leases and customer and trade name intangibles. The remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization. Amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues, while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as operating expense. The estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles range from five to 25 years. The following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended December 31:\nChange\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019 $ %\nAmortization of customer and trade name intangibles $ 21,662 $ 21,445 $ 217 1 %\nAmortization of customer and trade name intangibles increased due to the impact of intangibles added with several acquisitions completed in 2019.\nEstimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles, excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues, for the next five years and thereafter is as follows (in thousands):\n2021 $ 21,317\n2022 20,827\n2023 20,753\n2024 20,201\n2025 19,672\nThereafter 116,779\nAmortization expense relating to acquired leases will be recorded as a reduction to hardware and other revenue and is expected to be $525,000 in 2021, $525,000 in 2022, $525,000 in 2023, $525,000 in 2024, $397,000 in 2025, and $114,000 thereafter.\nOther\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of other income, net for the years ended December 31:\nChange\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019 $ %\nOther income, net $ 2,116 $ 3,471 $ (1,355) (39)%\nOther income is comprised of interest income from invested cash net of interest expense and non-usage and other fees associated with our revolving credit agreement. The decrease in other income, net compared to the prior period is attributable to the significant decrease in interest rates on cash balances since March 2020, partially offset by higher levels of invested cash.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the years ended December 31:\nChange\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019 $ %\nIncome tax (benefit) provision $ (19,778) $ 13,311 $ (33,089) (249) %\nEffective income tax rate (11.3) % 8.3 %\nThe decrease in the income tax provision and the effective income tax rate in 2020 compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation in 2020. The share-based exercise and vesting activity in 2020 generated excess tax benefits of $60.2 million, while exercise and vesting activity in 2019 generated $29.8 million of excess tax benefits. Excluding the impact of the excess tax benefits, our income tax provision and effective tax rate in 2020 would have been $40.4 million and 23.1% and in 2019, would have been $43.1 million and 27.0%, respectively.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act, which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, provides an estimated $2.2 trillion to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and stimulate the U.S. economy. The assistance includes tax relief and government loans, and investments and grants for entities in affected industries (e.g., health care, airlines). The business tax provisions of the CARES Act include temporary changes to income and non-income based tax laws, including the ability to utilize net operating losses, interest expense deductions, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, charitable contributions, and depreciation of qualified improvement property. Measures not related to income-based taxes include (1) allowing an employer to pay its share of Social Security payroll taxes that would otherwise be due from the date of enactment through December 31, 2020, over the following two years and (2) allowing eligible employers subject to closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic to receive a 50% credit on qualified wages against their employment taxes each quarter, with any excess credits eligible for refunds.\nThe most significant provision of the CARES Act impacting our accounting for income taxes is the five-year carryback allowance for taxable net operating losses generated in tax years in which the statutory federal income tax rate is 21.0% to periods in which the statutory federal income tax rate is 35.0%. We intend to carry back our 2020 taxable loss into our 2015 tax year, which results in a $3.4 million income tax benefit in the current year.\nThe effective income tax rates in both 2020 and 2019 differed from the United States federal statutory corporate income tax rate of 21% primarily due to state income taxes, the research tax credit, non-deductible share-based compensation expense, disqualifying incentive stock award dispositions, and other non-deductible business expenses. The 2020 effective income tax rate also includes the tax benefit of the five-year carryback of the federal net operating loss allowed under the CARES Act.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $603.6 million compared to $232.7 million at December 31, 2019. We also had $154.8 million invested in investment grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds and asset-backed securities as of December 31, 2020, compared to $81.6 million at December 31, 2019. These investments mature from 2021 through 2028 and we intend to hold these investments until maturity. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with several domestic banks and money market funds. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings and one outstanding letter of credit totaling $2.0 million in favor of a client contract. We believe our revolving line of credit, cash from operating activities, cash on hand and access to the credit markets provide us with sufficient flexibility to meet our long-term financial needs.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended December 31:\n($ in thousands) 2020 2019 2018\nCash flows provided (used) by:\nOperating activities $ 355,089 $ 254,720 $ 250,203\nInvesting activities (98,320) (245,015) (238,255)\nFinancing activities 114,172 88,698 (63,595)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 370,941 $ 98,403 $ (51,647)\nNet cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures. Other potential capital resources include cash on hand, public and private issuances of debt or equity securities, and bank borrowings. It is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors. We currently believe that cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, income tax obligations, and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months.\nIn 2020, operating activities provided cash of $355.1 million compared to $254.7 million in 2019. Operating activities that provided cash were primarily comprised of net income of $194.8 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of $81.7 million, non-cash share-based compensation expense of $67.4 million and non-cash decrease in operating lease right-of-use assets of $5.8 million. Working capital, excluding cash, decreased approximately $1.9 million due to higher accounts receivable resulting from an increase in unbilled receivables attributed to revenues recognized prior to billings, higher accounts receivable related to annual maintenance and subscription billings, timing of income tax payments, and the deferred taxes associated with stock option activity during the period. These increases were offset by the growth in deferred revenue balances and timing of payments of payroll related taxes and vendor invoices.\nIn general, changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance and subscription billings. Our renewal dates occur throughout the year, but our largest maintenance renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters.\nDays sales outstanding in accounts receivable were 121 days at December 31, 2020, compared to 117 days at December 31, 2019. The increase in our DSO is mainly due to an increase in unbilled receivables attributed to the increase in software license revenue for which we have recognized revenue at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer, but the billing has not yet been submitted to the customer. An increase in software services contracts accounted for using progress-to-completion method of revenue recognition in which the services are performed in one accounting period, but the billing normally occurs subsequently in another accounting period also contributed to the increase in DSO. Furthermore, our maintenance billing cycle typically peaks at its highest level in June and second highest level in December of each year and is followed by collections in the subsequent quarter. DSO is calculated based on quarter-end accounts receivable (excluding long-term receivables but including unbilled receivables) divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by 360 days.\nInvesting activities used cash of $98.3 million in 2020 compared to $245.0 million in 2019. We invested $156.6 million and received $82.7 million in proceeds from investment grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds and asset-backed securities with maturity dates ranging from 2021 through 2028. During 2020, we received $15.0 million in proceeds from the sale of the investment in convertible preferred stock representing a 20% interest in Record Holdings to BFTR, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bison Capital Partners V.L.P. During the same period, we purchased $10.0 million in common stock representing a 18% interest in BFTR, LLC. We paid $1.3 million in working capital and indemnity holdbacks in connection with the 2019 acquisition of Courthouse Technologies, Ltd. Approximately $22.7 million was invested in property and equipment, including $9.9 million related to real estate. In addition, approximately $5.8 million of software development was capitalized in 2020. The remaining additions were for computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth, particularly with respect to data centers supporting growth in our cloud-based offerings. These expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations.\nIn 2019, we invested $54.7 million and received $70.8 million in proceeds from investment grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds and asset-backed securities with maturity dates ranging from 2020 through 2023. On February 28, 2019, we acquired all of the capital stock of MicroPact. The total purchase price, net of cash acquired of $2.0 million, was approximately $202.2 million, including $198.2 million paid in cash and accrued contingent consideration of $6.0 million at December 31, 2019. On February 1, 2019, we acquired all the assets of MyCivic for the total purchase price of $3.7 million paid in cash. On October 30, 2019, we acquired certain assets of CHT. The total purchase price was approximately $20.5 million of which $19.1 million was paid in cash and approximately $1.4 million accrued for working capital and indemnity holdbacks, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Approximately $37.2 million was invested in property and equipment, including $20.8 million related to real estate. In addition, approximately $4.8 million of software development was capitalized in 2019. The remaining additions were for computer equipment and furniture and fixtures in support of internal growth, particularly with respect to data centers supporting growth in our cloud-based offerings. These expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $114.2 million in 2020 compared to $88.7 million in 2019. Financing activities in 2020 were primarily comprised of collections of $135.3 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity. We also purchased approximately 59,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $15.5 million.\nFinancing activities provided cash of $88.7 million in 2019 compared to cash used of $63.6 million in 2018. Financing activities in 2019 were primarily comprised of collections of $106.5 million from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan activity. We also purchased approximately 72,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $14.3 million.\nIn February 2019, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 1.5 million shares of Tyler common stock. The repurchase program, which was approved by our board of directors, was announced in October 2002, and was amended at various times from 2003 through 2019. As of February 19, 2021, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to 2.5 million additional shares of our common stock. Our share repurchase program allows us to repurchase shares at our discretion. Market conditions influence the timing of the buybacks and the number of shares repurchased, as well as the volume of employee stock option exercises. Share repurchases are generally funded using our existing cash balances and borrowings under our credit facility and may occur through open market purchases and transactions structured through investment banking institutions, privately negotiated transactions and/or other mechanisms. There is no expiration date specified for the authorization and we intend to repurchase stock under the plan from time to time.\nOn September 30, 2019, we entered into a $400.0 million credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with the various lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent. The Credit Facility provides for an unsecured revolving credit line of up to $400.0 million, including a $25.0 million sublimit for letters of credit. The Credit Facility matures on September 30, 2024. Borrowings under the Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital requirements, acquisitions and share repurchases. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate of either (1) Wells Fargo Bank\u2019s prime rate (subject to certain higher rate determinations) plus a margin of 0.125% to 0.75% or (2) the 30, 60, 90 or 180 day LIBOR rate plus a margin of 1.125% to 1.75%. As of December 31, 2020, our interest rate was 3.38% under the prime rate option or approximately 1.27% under the 30-day LIBOR option. The Credit Facility is unsecured by substantially all of our assets. The Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions and prohibits us from making certain investments, advances, cash dividends or loans, and limits incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with those covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings and had unused borrowing capacity of $400.0 million under the Credit Facility. We paid interest of $610,000 in 2020, $1,750,000 in 2019, and $770,000 in 2018.\nWe paid income taxes, net of refunds received, of $3.3 million in 2020, $21.3 million in 2019, and $6.8 million in 2018. In 2020, we experienced significant stock option exercise activity that generated net tax benefits of $60.2 million and reduced tax payments accordingly. In 2019 and 2018, excess tax benefits were $29.8 million and $32.5 million, respectively.\nWe anticipate that 2021 capital spending will be between $39 million and $40 million, including approximately $3 million related to real estate and approximately $17 million of capitalized software development. We expect the majority of the other capital spending will consist of computer equipment and software for infrastructure replacements and expansion. Capital spending is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.\nFrom time to time we engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates. In order to pursue such opportunities, which could require significant commitments of capital, we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future. No assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed. We lease office facilities for use in our operations, as well as transportation and other equipment. Most of our leases are non-cancelable operating lease agreements and they expire from one year to seven years. Some of these leases include options to extend for up to 10 years.\nCAPITALIZATION\nAt December 31, 2020, our capitalization consisted of no outstanding debt and $2.0 billion of shareholders\u2019 equity.",

These integrations provide multi-modal biometric authentication to replace or augment passwords for use with enterprise and consumer class systems.\nOur law enforcement solutions enable agencies to quickly capture, archive, search, retrieve, and share digital images, fingerprints and other biometrics, as well as criminal history records on a stand-alone, networked, wireless or Web-based platform. We develop, sell and support a suite of modular software products used by law enforcement and public safety agencies to create and manage criminal history records and to investigate crime. Our IWS Law Enforcement solution consists of five software modules: Capture and Investigative modules, which provide a criminal booking system with related databases, as well as the ability to create and print mug photo/scars, marks, and tattoos (SMT), as well as image lineups and electronic mug-books; a Facial Recognition module, which uses biometric facial recognition to identify suspects; a Web module, which provides access to centrally stored records over the Internet in a connected or wireless fashion; and a LiveScan module, which incorporates LiveScan capabilities into IWS Law Enforcement platform providing integrated fingerprint and palm print biometric management for civil and law enforcement use. The IWS Biometric Engine\u00ae is also available to our law enforcement clients and allows them to capture and search using multiple biometrics.\nRecent Developments\nNew Products\nIn July 2020, we introduced BioIntellic\u2122, our standalone, highly scalable anti-spoofing detection feature (embedded in the IWS Biometric Engine\u00ae) to ensure secure onboarding. BioIntellic\u2122 bolsters our joint offering with our existing proofing partner in the African market, Contactable, and also supports our existing MTN business as well as drives new business in the African region and beyond.\nIn October 2021, we completed a new QuickCapture Mobile software product that resides on the Laxton Chameleon 5 and 8 devices. QuickCapture Mobile will be an inherent part of our newest generation law enforcement platform, called LE 2.0. This powerful solution allows officers, public safety and military personnel in the field to have dynamic data on a perpetrator in the palm of their hands.\nIn December 2020, we reached code completion of our GoVerifyID product, now renamed to Imageware Authenticate, which introduced a new administration portal for easier management and usability of the product along with compatibility with many other 3rd party identity and Cloud services, through the inclusion of identity protocols SAML and OIDC.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. As of March 2021, the global outbreak of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve, and the extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business and markets we serve will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken both in the United States and other countries. We are continuing to vigilantly monitor the situation with our primary focus on health and safety of our employees and clients.\nThe Series D Financing\nOn November 12, 2020 and December 23, 2020, the Company consummated private placements of 12,060 shares of its Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \"Series D Preferred\"), resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $12.06 million, less fees and expenses (the \u201cSeries D Financing\u201d). The gross proceeds include approximately $2.2 million in principal amount due and payable under the terms of certain term loans issued by the Company on September 29, 2020 (\u201cBridge Notes\u201d), which Bridge Notes were converted into Series D Preferred at Closing (the \u201cConversion\u201d). The issuance of the Series D Preferred was made pursuant to securities purchase agreements, dated September 28, 2020 (the \"Purchase Agreement\"), by and between the Company and certain accredited investors (the \"Purchasers\"), for the sale of the Series D Preferred at a purchase price of $1,000 per share of Series D Preferred. The holders of Series D Preferred may voluntarily convert their shares of Series D Preferred into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at any time that is at least ninety days following the issuance date, at the conversion price calculated by dividing the Stated Value by the conversion price of $0.0583 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustments as set forth in Section 5(e) of the Certificate of Designations, Preferences, and Rights of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the \"Series D Certificate\"). Dividends on shares of Series D Preferred will be paid prior to any junior securities, and are to be paid at the rate of 4% of the Stated Value (as defined in the Series D Certificate) per share per annum in the form of shares of Series D Preferred.\nOn the fourth anniversary of the Issuance Date (as defined in the Series D Certificate), or in the event of the consummation of a Change of Control (as defined in the Series D Certificate), if any shares of Series D Preferred are outstanding, then each holder of Series D Preferred shall have the right (the \u201cHolder Redemption Right\u201d), at such holder\u2019s option, to require the Company to redeem all or any portion of such holder\u2019s shares of Series D Preferred at the Liquidation Preference Amount per share of Series D Preferred plus an amount equal to all accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, (such price, the \u201cHolder Redemption Price\u201d), which Holder Redemption Price shall be paid in cash.\nIn connection with the sale of the Series D Preferred, we granted certain registration rights to the Investors with respect to the Conversion Shares and Dividend Shares, pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement by and among us and the Investors. The registration statement registering the Conversion Shares and Dividend Shares was declared effective by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) on February 12, 2021.\nSolutions and Products\nWe are a \"biometrics first\" security company who brings the highest level of security to systems, data and places, by identifying and authenticating people through biometrics. Our solutions are focused on biometrics and secure credentials providing complete, cross-functional interoperable systems and an open architecture.\nIWS Biometric Engine. This is a biometric identity and authentication database for multi-biometric enrollment, management and authentication, managing population databases of unlimited sizes without regard to hardware or algorithm. Searches can be 1:1 (verification), 1:N (identification), and N:N (database integrity). IWS Biometric Engine is biometric agnostic, enabling the use of biometric devices and algorithms from any vendor, and with current support of the following biometric types: finger, face, iris, palm, and voice. We leverage the IWS Biometric Engine\u00ae to create products that provide government, law enforcement, public safety, border management and enterprise businesses, with a wide variety of solutions that address specific problems, mandates and technology standards.\nImageWare Authenticate. The Company introduced GoVerify ID\u00ae, now known as ImageWare Authenticate, a multi-factor biometric authentication, MFA product, for the enterprise markets on November 14, 2016. ImageWare Authenticate supports multimodal biometric Cloud-based matching and authentication including, but not limited to, face, voice, fingerprint, iris, palm, and more. All the biometrics can be combined with authentication and access control tools, including tokens, digital certificates, passwords, and PINS, to provide the ultimate level of assurance, accountability, and ease of use for corporate networks, web applications, mobile devices, and PC desktop environments. ImageWare Authenticate provides multimodal biometric identity authentication that can be used in place of passwords or as a strong second factor authentication method. ImageWare Authenticate is provided as a Cloud-based SaaS solution, thereby, eliminating complex IT deployment of biometric software and eliminating startup costs. ImageWare Authenticate works with existing mobile devices, eliminating the need for specialized biometric scanning devices typically used with most biometric solutions. We enhanced the product and completed this work on December 31, 2020. We relaunched ImageWare Authenticate on February 1, 2021.\nIWS EPI Suite. This is an ID software solution for producing, issuing, and managing secure credentials and personal identification cards, also called biometric smart badges. It is used by many human resource departments, along with other corporate groups, to enroll employees and print physical badges which may be used later for physical access.\u202fUsers can efficiently manage large amounts of data, images and card designs, as well as track and issue multiple cards per person, automatically populate multiple cards and eliminate redundant data entry. IWS EPI Suite was designed to integrate with our customers\u2019 existing security and computing infrastructure. We believe that this compatibility may be an appealing feature to corporations, government agencies, transportation departments, schools, and other public institutions.\nIWS EPI Builder. This is an SDK and a leading secure credential component of identity management and security solutions, providing all aspects of ID functionality from image and biometric capture to the enrollment, issuance and management of secure documents. It contains components which developers or systems integrators can use to support and produce secure credentials, including national IDs, passports, International Civil Aviation Office -compliant travel documents, smartcards and driver licenses. IWS EPI Builder enables organizations to develop custom identification solutions or incorporate sophisticated identification capabilities into existing applications including the ability to capture images, biometric and demographic data; enable biometric identification and verification (1:1 and 1:X); as well as support numerous biometric hardware and software vendors. It also enables users to add electronic identification functionality for other applications, including access control, tracking of time and attendance, point of sale transactions, human resource systems, school photography systems, asset management, inventory control, warehouse management, facilities management and card production systems. We intend to update the EPI Suite and Builder platforms in late 2021 and offer these products in the Cloud.\nIWS Law Enforcement. IWS Law Enforcement is a digital booking, identification and investigative platform that enables users to digitally capture, store, search and retrieve images and demographic data, including mugshots and line ups, fingerprints and scars, marks and tattoos (SMT\u2019s). Law enforcement may choose between submitting fingerprint data directly to the State Automated Fingerprint Identification System (\u201cAFIS\u201d), FBI criminal repository, or other agencies as required. Additional features and functionality include real-time access to images and data, creation of photo lineups or electric mug books, and production of identification cards and credentials.\u202fIWS Law Enforcement also uses off-the-shelf, biometric hardware and is designed to comply with open industry standards so that it can operate on an array of systems ranging from a stand-alone personal computer or handheld to larger, integrated systems. To avoid duplication of entries, the system can be integrated easily with several other information storage and retrieval systems, such as a records/jail management system (\u201cRMS/JMS\u201d) or an automated fingerprint identification system. We intend to update the Law Enforcement platform in first half of 2021 and offer the full suite in the Cloud as a SaaS offering.\nThe IWS Law Enforcement platform contains the following components:\nCapture. This software module allows users to capture and store a variety of images (facial, SMT and others such as evidence photos) as well as biographical text information. Each record includes images and text information in an easy-to-view format made up of fields designed and defined by the individual agency. Current customers of this module range from agencies that capture a few thousand mug shots per year to those that capture hundreds of thousands of mug shots each year.\nLiveScan. This software module is FBI certified\u202fand complies with the FBI Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (\u201cIAFIS\u201d) Image Quality Specifications (\u201cIQS\u201d) while utilizing FBI certified LiveScan devices from most major vendors. LiveScan allows users to capture single to ten prints and palm data, providing an integrated biometric management solution for both civil and law enforcement use. By adding LiveScan capabilities, law enforcement organizations further enhance the investigative process by providing additional identifiers to identify suspects involved in a crime.\u202fIn addition, officers no longer need to travel to multiple booking stations to capture fingerprints and mugshots.\u202fAll booking information, including images, may be located at a central designation and from there routed to the State AFIS or FBI criminal history record repository.\nInvestigative. This software module allows users to search the database created with IWS Law Enforcement. Officers can conduct text searches in many fields, including file number, name, alias, distinctive features, and other information, such as gang membership and criminal history. The Investigative module creates a catalogue of possible matches, allowing officers or witnesses to save time by looking only at mug shots that closely resemble the description of the suspect. This module can also be used to create a line-up of similar facial images from which a witness may identify the suspect.\nEPI Designer for Law Enforcement. The EPI Designer for LE software is a design solution created for the IWS Law Enforcement databases based on the IWS EPI Suite program.\u202fThis program allows integration with various IWS databases for the production of unique booking/inmate reports, wristbands, photo ID cards, Wanted or BOLO fliers, etc., created from the information stored in booking records. Designs can be created in minutes and quickly added to the IWS Law Enforcement system, allowing all users with appropriate permissions immediate access to the newly added form.\nQuick Capture. Quick Capture is a multiple biometric capture application that dynamically adapts to a client\u2019s required use case, including different city, state, and federal charge codes. With it, you can collect a variety of biometrics (face, finger, palm, iris, voice, etc.) using a variety of biometric hardware in the order desired as well as any needed biographic information associated with the subjects.\nBioIntellic. BioIntellic is a facial matching and anti-spoofing product integrated into ImageWare Authenticate. It is designed to prevent presentation attacks, by ensuring the captured biometric image is that of a live individual, not a picture of 3D mask. BioIntellic is also available as a standalone product, enabling companies to quickly integrate facial matching and liveness detection into their offerings.\nMaintenance and Customer Support\nMaintenance and support enrollment entitles software license customers to technical support services, including telephone and email support, problem resolution services, and the right to receive unspecified product upgrades, maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period. Maintenance and support service fees are an important source of recurring revenue, and we invest continuing resources into providing maintenance and support services.\nCustomers\nWe have a wide variety of domestic and international customers. Most of our IWS Law Enforcement customers are government agencies at the federal, state and local levels in the United States and Canada, but we also have clients outside of North America. For the year ended December 31, 2020, two customers accounted for approximately 61% or $2,921,000 of total revenue and had trade receivables of approximately $250,000 as of the end of the year. For the year ended December 31, 2019, two customers accounted for approximately 37% or $1,301,000 of total revenue and had trade receivables of approximately $161,000 as of the end of the year.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy is to be a \u201cbiometric first\u201d cybersecurity company bringing the highest level of security to systems, data and places by identifying and authenticating people through biometrics. We sell to governments, law enforcement and public safety, as well as enterprises, through key partners and large systems integrators and with our own direct sales team.\nWith recent COVID-19 events, remote work and social distancing have quickly been brought to the forefront of society. And while the impact of these events will be seen in the coming years, many problems have been immediately realized by corporations and government agencies, who are diligently looking for solutions to operate in a new business environment.\nWithin a matter of weeks, corporations and government agencies have had to heavily rely upon remote access technologies to enable work continuity through the pandemic. This increase in employees remotely accessing sensitive corporate systems has increased the risk of both cybercrime and unintentional information leaks. This risk is also increased by the fact that many employees now use a mixture of personal and corporate owned devices on the job, a trend known as, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD).\nVerification of an individual through biometrics is an effective way to authenticate users accessing sensitive information and systems. ImageWare Authenticate provides this functionality and is already integrated in many of the authentication systems leveraged by large companies and agencies to manage the identities of their employees and users. We will market and sell ImageWare Authenticate as a solution for protecting corporate data to the most relevant business verticals during this time of increased susceptibility to broad cyberattacks, such as malware, viruses, trojans, ransomware infections and phishing attacks.\nAdditionally, social distancing and the need to limit personal contact throughout everyday life is driving governments and corporations to deploy new ways to continue work and commerce while minimizing contact points between individuals. We believe this trend will increase the acceptance and use of biometrics as a means of contactless and touchless authentication for health, retail, finance/banking, government services, higher education and transportation.\nScaling out biometrics across these verticals is going to require new methods and solutions to support the increased number of users and transactions. With our decades of experience innovating and scaling government grade biometric solutions and our years executed strategy of creating multimodal, vendor agnostic solutions, ImageWare has had a rich portfolio of products and solutions to address these new challenges brought on by the pandemic.\u202f\nAdditionally, the law enforcement community continues to be an important market and customer base. Over the past few years, innovation within our law enforcement product line has been static, which has resulted in revenue being primarily driven from support and maintenance. Recently ImageWare released a new product offering to the law enforcement sector called, QuickCapture Mobile. Quick Capture Mobile streamlines the process of capturing biometrics from perpetrators on a mobile, PC-based device, in the field. The law enforcement market will immediately benefit from this product. We believe we can develop the Quick Capture product to service other verticals such as; corporate, telecommunications, academia, hospitality and entertainment.\nWe believe the increasing demand for biometric technology will drive demand for our solutions.\u202fIn the coming year, we will work to develop an Identity Platform, which combines all of our products onto one end-to-end, Cloud-based platform, allowing large clients to do enrollments (Enroll, Verify, Credential and Authenticate). The building blocks of the Identity Platform consist of upgrades to our current standalone products (IWS LE, EPI Builder, and ImageWare Authenticate) as well as a new identity proofing product, to be developed to verify the authenticity of government issued IDs. The Enroll, Verify, Credential and Authenticate workflow, is foundational to the majority of governments and corporate opportunities we compete for, and therefore, a key to the Identity Platform. This single platform which allows a customer to create a digital identity fully vetted against a government issued ID, use it thereafter for a reliable biometric authentication and manage that identity through its life cycle is compelling. We are scheduling the Identity Platform to be completed in late 2021.\nSales and Marketing\nWe market and sell our products in most major world markets directly through our salesforce and indirectly through channel partners, including resellers, distributors and systems integrators. Our sales force includes both field, and inside sales, which provides us a lower-cost channel for additional sales into existing customers and for expanding our customer base.\nInternational Operations\nWe are a global company. We are headquartered in San Diego, California with a remote office in Ottawa, Canada. Our main business operations are based in San Diego, California. We regularly seek out opportunities to efficiently expand our operations in international locations that offer highly talented resources as a way to maximize our global competitiveness.\nSoftware Licenses\nThe bulk of our revenue presently is generated from new subscription and historical maintenance payments for our software solutions for Law Enforcement, Badging, Identity Management, and Multi-factor Access, MFA. \u202fWe currently have four primary revenue sources:\n- Annual Maintenance of our Law Enforcement Solution;\n- Perpetual license revenue of our Badging Solution;\n- Term Subscriptions of our ImageWare Authenticate solution; and \u202f\n- Professional Services fees associated with implementation and training for our customers.\nWe are actively engaged in simplifying our revenue sources, migrating our existing customers Annual Maintenance, and perpetual license agreements to more consistent and sustainable subscription models.\nSoftware as a Service Business Model\nWe also provide an on-demand SaaS offering for ImageWare Authenticate.\u202fSaaS offerings will be offered on a subscription term-limited basis.\u202fWe are exploring offering additional products as SaaS offerings on a subscription term-limited basis.\nCompetition\nBiometric Market\nThe market to provide biometric systems to the identity management market is evolving and we face competition from a number of sources. We believe that the strength of our competitive position is based on:\n\u25cf\nOur ability to provide a system which enables the enrollment, management and authentication of multiple biometrics managing population databases of unlimited sizes;\n\u25cf\nSearches can be 1:1 (verification), 1:N (identification), and N:N (database integrity); and\n\u25cf\nThe system is technology and biometric agnostic, enabling the use of biometric devices and algorithms from any vendor, and the support of the following biometric types: finger, face, iris, palm and voice\nOur multifactor-biometric product faces competition from Duo, HYPR, Daon and Aware Inc., none of which have offerings with the scope and flexibility of our IWS Biometric Engine and its companion suite of products or relevant patent protection.\nCredential Market\nDue to the breadth of our software offering in the secure credential market space, we face differing degrees of competition in certain market segments.

Our products in this market consist of IWS EPI Suite and IWS EPI Builder. These products allow for production of digital identification badges and related databases and records and can be used by, among others, schools, airports, hospitals, corporations and governments. We have added the ability to incorporate multiple biometrics into the ID systems with the integration of IWS Biometric Engine\u00ae.\nThe Company is also a developer of a biometric based multi-factor authentication (MFA) Cloud-based service. ImageWare Authenticate brings together Cloud and mobile technologies to offer multi-factor authentication for the enterprise, and across industries. ImageWare Authenticate consists of mobile and desktop clients, and the backend system which is a Cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) servicing Cloud-based biometric template matching requests. ImageWare Authenticate comes in two offerings, Workforce and Customer. ImageWare Authenticate Customer is leveraged by product developers to enable biometric authentication for their consumers. For the enterprise, ImageWare Authenticate Workplace provides turnkey integration with Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Active Directory, CA SSO, IBM Security Access Manager (\u201cISAM\u201d), SAP Cloud Platform,\u202fFujitsu's RunMyProcess, Palo Alto Networks VPN\u202fand HPE\u2019s Aruba ClearPass. These integrations provide multi-modal biometric authentication to replace or augment passwords for use with enterprise and consumer class systems.\nOur law enforcement solutions enable agencies to quickly capture, archive, search, retrieve, and share digital images, fingerprints and other biometrics, as well as criminal history records on a stand-alone, networked, wireless or Web-based platform. We develop, sell and support a suite of modular software products used by law enforcement and public safety agencies to create and manage criminal history records and to investigate crime. Our IWS Law Enforcement solution consists of five software modules: Capture and Investigative modules, which provide a criminal booking system with related databases as well as the ability to create and print mug photo/scars, marks, and tattoos (SMT), as well as image lineups and electronic mug-books; a Facial Recognition module, which uses biometric facial recognition to identify suspects; a Web module, which provides access to centrally stored records over the Internet in a connected or wireless fashion; and a LiveScan module, which incorporates LiveScan capabilities into IWS Law Enforcement platform providing integrated fingerprint and palm print biometric management for civil and law enforcement use. The IWS Biometric Engine\u00ae is also available to our law enforcement clients and allows them to capture and search using multiple biometrics.\nRecent Market Conditions\nDuring March 2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization related to the rapidly growing outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d).\nThe pandemic has significantly impacted the economic conditions both in the United States and worldwide, with accelerated effects in February 2020 through the date of this Annual Report, as federal, state and local governments react to the public health crisis, creating significant uncertainties in both the worldwide and the United States economies. The situation is rapidly changing and additional impacts to our business may arise that we are not aware of currently. We cannot predict whether, when or the manner in which the conditions surrounding COVID-19 will change including the timing of lifting any restrictions or office closure requirements.\nThe full extent of COVID-19\u2019s impact on our operations and financial performance depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its impact on capital and financial markets and any new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, its spread to other regions as well as the actions taken to contain it, among others.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the \u201cCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d). The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, increased limitations on qualified charitable contributions and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property.\nThe Company continues to examine the impact that the CARES Act may have on our business. Currently the Company is unable to determine the impact that the CARES Act will have on our financial condition, results of operation or liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during a fiscal period. The SEC considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application.\nSignificant estimates include the evaluation of our ability to continue as a going concern, the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of share-based payments, fair value of Series D Preferred and financial instruments issued with and affected by the Series D Preferred Financing (defined below), fair value of financial instruments with and affected by the Series C Preferred (defined below), fair value of Series A Preferred (defined below), fair value of Series A-1 Preferred (defined below), assumptions used in the application of revenue recognition policies, assumptions used in the derivation of the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate used in the computation of the Company\u2019s operating lease liabilities and assumptions used in the application of fair value methodologies to calculate the fair value of pension assets and obligations. Actual results could differ from estimates.\nThe following are our critical accounting policies because we believe they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain. If actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected.\nRevenue Recognition. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d), Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d), using the modified retrospective transition method.\nIn accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nThe core principle of the standard is that we should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, we apply the following five step model:\n1.\nIdentify the contract with the customer;\n2.\nIdentify the performance obligation in the contract;\n3.\nDetermine the transaction price;\n4.\nAllocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n5.\nRecognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nAt contract inception, we assess the goods and services promised in a contract with a customer and identify as a performance obligation each promise to transfer to the customer either: (i) a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct or (ii) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. We recognize revenue only when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer.\nDetermining the timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations as well as the transaction price and the amounts allocated to performance obligations requires judgement.\nWe disclose disaggregation of our customer revenue by classes of similar products and services as follows:\n\u25cf\nSoftware licensing and royalties;\n\u25cf\nSales of computer hardware and identification media;\n\u25cf\nServices; and\n\u25cf\nPost-contract customer support.\nSoftware licensing and royalties\nSoftware licenses consist of revenue from the sale of software for identity management applications. Our software licenses are functional intellectual property and typically provide customers with the right to use our software in perpetuity as it exists when made available to the customer. We recognize revenue from software licensing at a point in time upon delivery, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nRoyalties consist of revenue from usage-based arrangements and guaranteed minimum-based arrangements. We recognize revenue for royalty arrangements at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied.\nComputer hardware and identification media\nWe generate revenue from the sale of computer hardware and identification media. Revenue for these items is recognized upon delivery of these products to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nServices\nServices revenue is comprised primarily of software customization services, software integration services, system installation services and customer training. Revenue is generally recognized upon completion of services and customer acceptance provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\nPost-contract customer support (\u201cPCS\u201d)\nPCS consists of maintenance on software and hardware for our identity management solutions. We recognize PCS revenue from periodic maintenance agreements. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the respective maintenance periods provided no significant obligations remain. Costs related to such contracts are expensed as incurred.\nArrangements with multiple performance obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. In addition to selling software licenses, hardware and identification media, services and post-contract customer support on a standalone basis, certain contracts include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on our best estimate of the relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price for a performance obligation is the price at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. The primary methods used to estimate standalone selling price are as follows: (i) the expected cost-plus margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service and (ii) the percent discount off of list price approach.\nContract costs\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract when the amortization period is one year or less.\nOther items\nWe do not offer rights of return for our products and services in the normal course of business.\nSales tax collected from customers is excluded from revenue.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers\u2019 inability to pay. We determine the amount of allowance by analyzing historical losses, customer concentrations, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends, and the age of the accounts receivable balances and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Other Intangible and Long-Lived Assets. The Company accounts for its intangible assets under the provisions of ASC 350, \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\u201d. In accordance with ASC 350, intangible assets with a definite life are analyzed for impairment under ASC 360-10-05 \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d and intangible assets with an indefinite life are analyzed for impairment under ASC 360 annually, or more often if circumstances dictate. The Company performs its annual simplified impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. In December 2018, the Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2017-04, \u201cIntangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d. The provisions of ASU 2017-04 eliminate the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. Entities that have reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will no longer be required to perform a qualitative assessment assuming they pass the simplified impairment test.\nThe Company did not record any goodwill impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their net book value may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The Company\u2019s management currently believes there is no impairment of its long-lived assets. There can be no assurance, however, that market conditions will not change or demand for the Company\u2019s products under development will continue. Either of these could result in future impairment of long-lived assets.\nThere are many management assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss, and estimates using different, but reasonable, assumptions could produce significantly different results. Significant assumptions include estimates of future levels of revenue and operating expense. Therefore, the timing and recognition of impairment losses by us in the future, if any, may be highly dependent upon our estimates and assumptions. There can be no assurance that goodwill impairment will not occur in the future.\nStock-Based Compensation. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had one stock-based compensation plan for employees and nonemployee directors, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock options and restricted stock.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, consistent with the provisions of ASC 718, \u201cCompensation - Stock Compensation\u201d. The fair value of stock options granted is recognized to expense over the requisite service period. Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards is recognized using the straight-line single-option method. Stock-based compensation expense is reported in general and administrative, sales and marketing, engineering and customer service expense based upon the departments to which substantially all of the associated employees report and credited to additional paid-in capital.\nASC 718 requires the use of a valuation model to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and interest rates. The Company is required to make various assumptions in the application of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company has determined that the best measure of expected volatility is based on the historical weekly volatility of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. Historical volatility factors utilized in the Company\u2019s Black-Scholes computations for options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 ranged from 57% and 83%. The Company has elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the SEC approved \u201csimplified method\u201d noted under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14. The expected term used by the Company to value the grants issued in 2020 and 2019 as computed by this method was 5.17 years. The effect of the difference between the actual historical expected life and the simplified method was immaterial. The interest rate used is the risk-free interest rate and is based upon U.S. Treasury rates appropriate for the expected term. Interest rates used in the Company\u2019s Black-Scholes calculations averaged 2.58% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Dividend yield is zero, as the Company does not expect to declare any dividends on the Company\u2019s common shares in the foreseeable future.\nIn addition to the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, the estimated forfeiture rate at the time of valuation is a critical assumption. The Company has estimated an annualized forfeiture rate of approximately 5.0% for corporate officers, 4.1% for members of the Board of Directors and 15.0% for all other employees. The Company reviews the expected forfeiture rate annually to determine if that percent is still reasonable based on historical experience.\nIncome Taxes. The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, \u201cAccounting for Income Taxes\u201d. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences related to temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes at each year-end, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when necessary based on the weight of available evidence, if it is considered more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Income tax expense is the sum of current income tax plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nASC 740-10 requires a company to first determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date, assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets this more-likely-than-not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority.\nWe recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Any tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our analysis of income tax reserves reflects the most likely outcome. We adjust these reserves, if any, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions and determining the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes. No assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company\u2019s historical income tax provisions and accruals. The Company adjusts these items in light of changing facts and circumstances. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nThe Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cRevenue Code\u201d) limits the availability of certain tax credits and net operating losses that arose prior to certain cumulative changes in a corporation\u2019s ownership resulting in a change of control of the Company. The Company\u2019s use of its net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards will be significantly limited because the Company believes it underwent \u201cownership changes\u201d, as defined under Section 382 of the Revenue Code, in 1991, 1995, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2011, 2012, 2018 and 2020, though the Company has not performed a study to determine the limitation. The Company has reduced its deferred tax assets to zero relating to its federal and state research credits because of such limitations. The Company continues to disclose the tax effect of the net operating loss carryforwards at their original amount as the actual limitation has not yet been quantified. The Company has also established a full valuation allowance for substantially all deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding its ability to generate future taxable income to realize these assets. Since substantially all deferred tax assets are fully reserved, future changes in tax benefits will not impact the effective tax rate. Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. If it is determined at some time in the future that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized, the valuation allowance would be reduced accordingly at that time.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act into law, which, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, increased limitations on qualified charitable contributions and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property.\nThe Company continues to examine the impact that the CARES Act may have on our business. Currently the Company is unable to determine the impact that the CARES Act will have on our financial condition, results of operation or liquidity.\nFair-Value Measurements. The Company accounts for fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820, \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\u201d, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below:\nLevel 1- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2- Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\nLevel 3- Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).\nAssessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. Determining whether a fair value measurement is based on Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 inputs is important because certain disclosures are applicable only to those fair value measurements that use Level 3 inputs. The use of Level 3 inputs may include information derived through extrapolation or interpolation which involves management assumptions as well as valuation techniques employing Monte Carlo simulation methodologies.\nLease Liabilities and Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets\nThe Company is a party to certain contractual arrangements for office space which meet the definition of leases under Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 842 - Leases (\u201cASC 842\u201d). In accordance with ASC 842, the Company has determined that such arrangements are operating leases and accordingly the Company has, as of January 1, 2019, recorded operating lease right-of-use assets and related lease liability for the present value of the lease payments over the lease terms using the Company\u2019s estimated weighted-average incremental borrowing rate of approximately 14.5%. The Company has utilized the practical expedient regarding lease and nonlease components and has combined such items into a single combined component. The Company has also utilized the practical expedient regarding leases of twelve months or less and has excluded such leases from its computation of lease liability and related right-of-use assets. The Company has also elected the optional transition package of practical expedients which include:\nA package of practical expedient to not reassess:\n\u25cf\nWhether a contract is or contains a lease\n\u25cf\nLease classification\n\u25cf\nInitial direct costs\nFor a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended December 31, 2020.\nComparison of Results for Fiscal Years Ended December 31, 2020 and\nProduct Revenue\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nNet Product Revenue\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nSoftware and royalties\n$872\n$489\n$383\n78%\nPercentage of total net product revenue\n39%\n53%\nHardware and consumables\n$84\n$96\n$(12)\n(13)%\nPercentage of total net product revenue\n4%\n10%\nServices\n$1,275\n$338\n$937\n277%\nPercentage of total net product revenue\n57%\n37%\nTotal net product revenue\n$2,231\n$923\n$1,308\n142%\nSoftware and royalty revenue increased 78% or approximately $383,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. This increase is attributable to higher identification project related revenue of approximately $539,000, offset by lower law enforcement project related revenue of approximately $11,000, lower royalty revenue of approximately $116,000 and lower sales of boxed identity management software sold through our distribution channel of approximately $29,000. The increase in identification project related revenue is reflective of the expansion of the Company\u2019s identity management software base combined with the sale of additional software licenses into existing identification projects caused by increased end-user utilization during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. The decrease in our law enforcement project revenue resulted from a decrease in the timing of procurement by our law enforcement customers. The decrease in boxed identity management software sold through our distribution channel reflects slightly lower procurement from both domestic and international customers and the decrease in royalty revenue reflects the expiration of a minimum royalty contract.\nRevenue from the sale of hardware and consumables decreased approximately $12,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 due to a decrease in project related solutions containing hardware and consumable sales primarily to law enforcement customers.\nServices revenue is comprised primarily of software integration services, system installation services and customer training. Such revenue increased $937,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019, due to an increase in the service element of project related work completed during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nWe believe that the period-to-period fluctuations of identity management software revenue in project-oriented solutions are largely due to the timing of government procurement with respect to the various programs we are pursuing. Although no assurances can be given, based on management\u2019s current visibility into the timing of potential government procurements and potential partnerships and current pilot programs, we believe that we will see an increase in government procurement and implementations with respect to identity management initiatives; however, government procurement initiatives, implementations and pilots are frequently delayed and extended and we cannot predict the timing of such initiatives.\nAs discussed more fully elsewhere in this Annual Report, the full extent of COVID-19\u2019s impact on our operations and financial performance depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, its impact our ability to close sales transactions and on capital and financial markets and any new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus, its spread to other regions as well as the actions taken to contain it, among others.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we have focused on strategically updating our products with the latest mobile and cloud technology prioritized by market opportunities. We relaunched ImageWare Authenticate (formerly GoVerify ID\u00ae) in July 2020. This relaunch includes a new container and microservices-based architecture along with refreshed mobile and desktop clients. We believe these updates will result in additional customers implementing our ImageWare Authenticate solution. Additionally, we have focused on the integration of the suite of products that comprise our Identity Platform. Throughout 2021 we plan to continue to enhance our Identity Platform products, including our EPI (our biometric smart access cards) and law enforcement offerings by leveraging cloud and mobile technologies to improve both functionality and value to the customer. Management believes that these initiatives will result in the expansion of our solutions into both law enforcement and non-governmental sectors including commercial, consumer and healthcare applications, further resulting in additional implementations of both our ImageWare Authenticate products and Identity Platform products.\nMaintenance Revenue\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nMaintenance Revenue\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nTotal maintenance revenue\n$2,554\n$2,583\n$(29)\n(1)%\nMaintenance revenue was approximately $2,554,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to approximately $2,583,000 for the corresponding periods in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, identity management maintenance revenue was approximately $1,264,000 as compared to $1,275,000 for the comparable period in 2019. The decrease of $11,000 in identification software maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period of 2019 is reflective of the expiration of certain maintenance contracts combined with the timing of the commencement of maintenance services related to a certain customer. The decrease of $18,000 in law enforcement maintenance revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period of 2019 is reflective of the expiration of certain maintenance contracts.\nWe anticipate growth of our maintenance revenue through the retention of existing customers combined with the expansion of our installed base resulting from the completion of project-oriented work; however, we cannot predict the timing of this anticipated growth.\nCost of Product Revenue\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nCost of Product Revenue:\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nSoftware and royalties\n$54\n$36\n$18\n50%\nPercentage of software and royalty product revenue\n6%\n7%\nHardware and consumables\n$52\n$66\n$(14)\n(21)%\nPercentage of hardware and consumables product revenue\n62%\n69%\nServices\n$694\n$116\n$578\n498%\nPercentage of services product revenue\n54%\n34%\nTotal product cost of revenue\n$800\n$218\n$582\n267%\nPercentage of total product revenue\n36%\n24%\nThe cost of software and royalty product revenue increased approximately $18,000 from higher software and royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $383,000 due to a significant percentage of the revenue increase containing solutions with extremely minimal third-party software costs. In addition to changes in costs of software and royalty product revenue caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of products can vary as a percentage of product revenue from period to period depending upon level of software customization and third-party software license content included in product sales during a given period.\nThe cost of product revenue for our hardware and consumable sales during the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased approximately $14,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 due primarily to lower hardware and consumable product revenue of approximately $12,000 during the 2020 period.\nThe cost of services revenue increased approximately $578,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 due to higher service revenue of approximately $937,000. Cost of services revenue as a percentage of service revenue increased to 54% for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 34% for the corresponding 2019 period. This increase reflects the one-time impact of additional service costs incurred in the completion of the service element for a particular customer. Although changes in costs of services product revenue are sometimes caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of services can also vary as a percentage of service revenue from period to period depending upon both the level and complexity of professional service resources utilized in the completion of the service element.\nCost of Maintenance Revenue\nMaintenance cost of revenue\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\n$ Change\n% Change\nTotal maintenance cost of revenue\n$448\n$425\n$23\n5%\nPercentage of total maintenance revenue\n18%\n16%\nCost of maintenance revenue increased approximately $23,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 despite lower maintenance revenue of approximately $29,000. This increase is reflective of higher maintenance labor costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 due primarily to the composition of engineering resources used in the provision of maintenance services.\nProduct Gross Profit\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nProduct gross profit\n$ Change\n% Change\n(dollars in thousands)\nSoftware and royalties\n$818\n$453\n$365\n81%\nPercentage of software and royalty product revenue\n94%\n93%\nHardware and consumables\n$32\n$30\n$2\n7%\nPercentage of hardware and consumables product revenue\n38%\n31%\nServices\n$581\n$222\n$359\n162%\nPercentage of services product revenue\n46%\n66%\nTotal product gross profit\n$1,431\n$705\n$726\n103%\nPercentage of total product revenue\n64%\n76%\nSoftware and royalty gross profit increased 81% or approximately $365,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019, due primarily to higher software and royalty revenue of approximately $383,000 combined with higher software and royalty cost of revenue of $18,000 for the same period. This revenue increase with only a minimal increase in software and royalty cost of revenue reflects extremely low third-party software costs. In addition to changes in costs of software and royalty product revenue caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of products can vary as a percentage of product revenue from period to period depending upon level of software customization and third-party software license content included in product sales during a given period.\nHardware and consumables gross profit increased approximately $2,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the 2019 period, due primarily to lower hardware and consumable revenue of approximately $12,000 combined with lower cost of hardware and consumable revenue of approximately $14,000. These decreases result from a decrease in project related solutions containing hardware and consumable components.\nServices gross profit increased approximately $359,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 due to higher service revenue of approximately $937,000 combined with higher service cost of revenue of $578,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. The decrease in services gross profit as a percentage of services revenue from 66% in the year ended December 31, 2019 to 46% in the corresponding period of 2020 reflects the one-time impact of additional service costs incurred in the completion of the service element for a particular customer. Although changes in costs of services product revenue are sometimes caused by revenue level fluctuations, costs of services can also vary as a percentage of service revenue from period to period depending upon both the level and complexity of professional service resources utilized in the completion of the service element.\nMaintenance Gross Profit\nMaintenance gross profit\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\n$ Change\n% Change\nTotal maintenance gross profit\n$2,106\n$2,158\n$(52)\n(2)%\nPercentage of total maintenance revenue\n82%\n84%\nGross profit related to maintenance revenue decreased 2% or approximately $52,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019.

The decrease in maintenance revenue results from the timing of maintenance revenue recognition related to a certain customer combined with the expiration of certain maintenance contracts. The increase cost of maintenance revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 is due primarily to the composition of engineering resources used in the provision of maintenance services. The decrease in maintenance revenue results from the timing of maintenance revenue recognition related to a certain contract.

General legal, accounting and consulting services, insurance, occupancy and communication costs are also included with general and administrative expense.\nThe dollar increase of approximately $488,000 in general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 is comprised of the following major components:\n\u25cf\nOverall decrease in personnel related expense of approximately $55,000 is due to reductions in employer contributions to employee benefit plans of approximately $230,000 offset by higher personnel expenses of approximately $175,000 due to the effects of various senior management changes;\n\u25cf\nIncreases in professional services of approximately $252,000 which includes higher legal fees of approximately $197,000, higher patent-related legal and other fees of approximately $155,000 resulting from the Company\u2019s efforts to monetize certain patents, higher contractor and contract service expenses of approximately $23,000 and higher general corporate expense of $16,000 offset by reductions in Board of Director fees of approximately $6,000, lower investor and public relations fees of approximately $106,000 and lower audit fees of approximately $27,000,\n\u25cf\nIncrease in insurances, licenses, dues, rent, office related costs and other of approximately $21,000;\n\u25cf\nIncrease in financing expense of approximately $66,000; and\n\u25cf\nIncrease in stock-based compensation expense related to options and restricted stock units (\"RSU\u2019s\") of approximately $204,000.\nWe continue to focus our efforts on achieving additional future operating efficiencies by reviewing and improving upon existing business processes and evaluating our cost structure. We believe these efforts will allow us to continue to gradually decrease our level of general and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of total revenue.\nSales and Marketing Expense\nSales and marketing expense consists primarily of the salaries, commissions, other incentive compensation, employee benefits and travel expense of our sales, marketing, and business development personnel.\nThe dollar decrease of approximately $1,001,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019 is primarily comprised of the following major components:\n\u25cf\nDecrease in personnel related expense of approximately $369,000 driven primarily by headcount reductions;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in contractor and contract services of approximately $388,000 resulting from lower contract service expense of approximately $303,000 which includes lower dues and subscription expense, and reduced utilization of certain sales consultants of approximately $85,000.;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in travel, trade show expense and office related expense of approximately $257,000;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in stock-based compensation expense of approximately $45,000; and\n\u25cf\nIncrease in our Mexico sales office expense of approximately $58,000 due to certain personnel separation expenses.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consists primarily of salaries, employee benefits and outside contractors for new product development, product enhancements, custom integration work and related facility costs.\nResearch and development expense decreased approximately $1,782,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the corresponding period in 2019, due primarily to the following major components:\n\u25cf\nDecrease in personnel related expense of approximately $1,092,000 due to headcount reductions;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in contractor fees and contract services of approximately $537,000;\n\u25cf\nDecrease in rent, office related expense and engineering tools and supplies of approximately $128,000; and\n\u25cf\nDecrease in stock based-compensation expense of approximately $25,000.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately $1,000 as compared to the corresponding period in 2019. The relatively small amount of depreciation and amortization reflects the relatively small property and equipment carrying value.\nInterest Expense (Income), Net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized interest income of $2,000 and interest expense of $104,000. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was comprised of approximately $94,000 on our related party notes payable and approximately $10,000 on notes payable under the PPP Loan program. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized interest income of $90,000 and interest expense of $0.\nOther Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized other income of approximately $0 and other expense of approximately $4,000. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 is comprised of approximately $4,000 in late payment penalty fees.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized other income of approximately $0 and other expense of $1,000. Other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 is comprised of approximately $1,000 in foreign transaction expense.\nChange in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $369,000 from the decrease of derivative liabilities arising from the consummation of the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock financing in September 2019 (\u201cSeries C Financing\u201d). Such decrease was determined by management using fair value methodologies and is included as non-cash income under the caption \u201cChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statement of operations for twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Also for the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized approximately $1,883,000 from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities arising from the Series D Financing. Such decrease was determined by management using fair value methodologies and is included as non-cash income under the caption \u201cChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statement of operations for twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized approximately $696,000 from the decrease of derivative liabilities arising from the consummation of the Series C Financing in September 2019. Such decrease was determined by management using fair value methodologies and is included as non-cash income under the caption \u201cChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statement of operations for twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded an expense for income taxes of $7,000 and $10,000, respectively. These tax expenses relate to taxes on income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions offset by research and development tax credits generated in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nWe have incurred consolidated pre-tax losses during the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019, and have incurred operating losses in all prior periods. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that a tax benefit from such losses will not be realized and has established a full valuation allowance for any tax benefits. Accordingly, we did not record a benefit for income taxes for these periods.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern\nHistorically, our principal sources of cash have included customer payments from the sale of our products, proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock and proceeds from the issuance of debt. Our principal uses of cash have included cash used in operations, product development, and payments relating to purchases of property and equipment. We expect that our principal uses of cash in the future will be for product development, including customization of identity management products for enterprise and consumer applications, further development of intellectual property, development of SaaS capabilities for existing products as well as general working capital. Management expects that, as our revenue grows, our sales and marketing and research and development expense will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate and, as a result, we will need to generate significant net revenue to achieve and sustain income from operations.\nLincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC\nOn April 28, 2020, the Company entered into a purchase agreement, and as amended on June 11, 2020 (the \u201cLincoln Purchase Agreement\u201d), and a registration rights agreement (the \u201cLincoln Registration Rights Agreement\u201d) with Lincoln Park Capital fund, LLC (\u201cLincoln Park\u201d) pursuant to which Lincoln Park committed to purchase up to $10,250,000 of our Common Stock.\nUnder the terms and subject to the conditions of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, including stockholder approval of an amendment to the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation, as amended from time to time (the \"Certificate of Incorporation\"), to increase the number of shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock to 350 million shares, obtained from our shareholders effective June 9, 2020, we have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to Lincoln Park, and Lincoln Park is obligated to purchase up to $10,250,000 of shares of Common Stock. Future sales of Common Stock under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, if any, will be subject to certain limitations, and may occur from time to time, at our sole discretion, over the 24-month period commencing on July 8, 2020, and the other conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement are satisfied (such date on which all of such conditions are satisfied, the \u201cCommencement Date\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold an aggregate of 5,700,000 shares of Common Stock to Lincoln Park under the terms of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement resulting in gross cash proceeds to the Company of approximately $918,000.\nAfter the Commencement Date, on any business day over the term of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, the Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to 125,000 shares of its Common Stock on such business day (the \u201cRegular Purchase\u201d), subject to increases under certain circumstances as provided in the Lincoln Purchase Agreement. The purchase price per share of Common Stock for each such Regular Purchase will be based on prevailing market prices of the Company\u2019s Common Stock immediately preceding the time of sale as computed under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement. In each case, Lincoln Park\u2019s maximum commitment in any single Regular Purchase may not exceed $500,000. In addition to Regular Purchases, provided that the Company presents Lincoln Park with a Lincoln Park Purchase Notice for the full amount allowed for a Regular Purchase, the Company may also direct Lincoln Park to make accelerated purchases and additional accelerated purchases as described in the Lincoln Purchase Agreement.\nPursuant to the terms of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, in no event may the Company issue or sell to Lincoln Park shares of Common Stock under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement which, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by Lincoln Park and its affiliates (as calculated pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-3 promulgated thereunder), would result in the beneficial ownership by Lincoln Park and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (the \u201cBeneficial Ownership Limitation\u201d).\nThe Lincoln Purchase Agreement and the Lincoln Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, agreements and conditions and indemnification obligations of the parties. The Company has the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time, at no cost or penalty. The Company issued to Lincoln Park 2,500,000 shares of Common Stock in consideration for entering into the Lincoln Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to this issuance, $400,000 was recorded by the Company as a deferred stock issuance cost. Such amount is recorded in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet under the caption \u201cOther assets\u201d. Such deferred stock issuance costs will be recognized as a charge against paid in capital in proportion to securities sold under this Lincoln Purchase Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized approximately $36,000, respectively, as a charge against paid in capital relating to securities sold under the Lincoln Purchase Agreement.\nDue to the terms of the Lincoln Purchase Agreement as described above, management is not currently expecting the related proceeds from the Lincoln Purchase Agreement to be sufficient to sustain operations for an extended period of time.\nSeries D Preferred Stock Financings\nOn November 12, 2020 and December 23, 2020, the Company consummated private placements of 12,060 shares of its Series D Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the \"Series D Preferred\"), resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $12.06 million, less fees and expenses (the \u201cSeries D Financing\u201d). The gross proceeds included approximately $2.2 million in principal amount due and payable under the terms of certain term loans issued by the Company on September 29, 2020 (\u201cBridge Notes\u201d), which Bridge Notes were converted into Series D Preferred at Closing (the \u201cConversion\u201d). The issuance of the Series D Preferred was made pursuant to securities purchase agreements, dated September 28, 2020 (the \"Series D Purchase Agreement\"), by and between the Company and certain accredited investors (the \"Purchasers\"), for the sale of the Series D Preferred at a purchase price of $1,000 per share of Series D Preferred. The holders of Series D Preferred may voluntarily convert their shares of Series D Preferred into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at any time that is at least ninety days following the issuance date, at the conversion price calculated by dividing the Stated Value by the conversion price of $0.0583 per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustments as set forth in Section 5(e) of the Certificate of Designations, Preferences, and Rights of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the \"Series D Certificate\"). Dividends on shares of Series D Preferred will be paid prior to any junior securities, and are to be paid at the rate of 4% of the Stated Value (as defined in the Series D Certificate) per share per annum in the form of cash or shares of Series D Preferred.\nConcurrently with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the Company and the Investors executed (i) a Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC within thirty days of closing to register the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred; (ii) a Series C Exchange Agreement (the \"Exchange Agreement\"), pursuant to which the Company and certain holders of the Company\u2019s Series C Preferred agreed to exchange their Series C Preferred, with a liquidation preference of approximately $10.0 million, for Series D Preferred at closing; and (iii) a Term Loan and Security Agreement (\u201cLoan Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which each investor signatory thereto agreed to make a term loan to the Company, secured by all assets of the Company, in an amount equal to 20% of such investor\u2019s purchase commitment as set forth in the Purchase Agreement (\u201cBridge Loan\u201d), which Bridge Loan, plus accrued interest, rolled into, and was used to purchase, Series D Preferred at Closing.\nBridge Loan\nConcurrently with the execution of the Series D Purchase Agreement, the Company and certain investors in the Series D Financing executed the Loan Agreement, pursuant to which each such investor signatory thereto (the \"Investors\") agreed to the Bridge Loan, secured by all assets of the Company, in an amount equal to 20% of such Investor\u2019s purchase commitment as set forth in the Series D Purchase Agreement, which Bridge Loan, plus accrued interest, rolled into, and was used to purchase, Series D Preferred at Closing. For more information regarding the Series D Purchase Agreement, the Investors, the Loan Agreement, and the Bridge Loan, see Note 1, Description of Business and Operations to the consolidated financial statements.\nPursuant to the Bridge Loan, the Company received proceeds of $2,187,000 in September 2020. The Bridge Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 12% and is due and payable in arrears on the earlier of the Loan Conversion Date, as such term is defined in the Loan Agreement, or six months after the disbursement of the Bridge Loan. All amounts due and payable pursuant to the Bridge Loan are automatically convertible, without further action by the Investors, into shares of Series D Preferred at closing at a purchase price of $1,000 for each share of Series D Preferred. The repayment of all amounts due under the terms of the Loan Agreement are secured by all assets of the Company. On November 12, 2020, contemporaneously with the closing of the Series D Preferred Financing, all amounts due under the Bridge Loan were converted into shares of Series D Preferred Stock.\nGoing Concern and Management\u2019s Plan\nAt December 31, 2020, we had negative working capital of approximately $19,349,000 as compared to negative working capital of approximately $1,653,000 at December 31, 2019. Included in our negative working capital as of December 31, 2020 are $24,128,000 of derivative liabilities which are not required to be settled in cash except in the event of the consummation of a Change of Control or at any time after the fourth anniversary of the Series D Preferred issuance, at which time the holders of the Series D Preferred may require the Company to redeem in cash any or all of the holder\u2019s outstanding Series D Preferred at an amount equal to the Series D Liquidation Preference Amount. At December 31, 2020 the Liquidation Preference Amount totaled $22,863,000.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the United States and global economies and may affect the Company's operations and those of third parties on which the Company relies. Additionally, as the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult to assess or predict, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial markets may reduce our ability to access capital, which could negatively impact the Company's short-term and long-term liquidity. These effects could have a material impact on the Company's liquidity, capital resources, operations and business and those of the third parties on which the Company relies.\nTo address our working capital requirements, management has instituted several cost cutting measures and has utilized cash proceeds from borrowing under the PPP loan, sales of our Common Shares utilizing the Lincoln Park facility and closing of the Series D Financing to satisfy the Company\u2019s working capital requirements. However, we believe our available cash balances will be insufficient to satisfy our cash requirement for the next twelve months from the date of this filing. To address our working capital requirements, management intends to seek additional equity and/or debt financing through the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities. Other than the Lincoln Purchase Agreement, there are currently no formal committed financing arrangements to support our projected cash shortfall, including commitments to purchase additional debt and/or equity securities, or other agreements, and no assurances can be given that we will be successful in raising additional capital through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities, or entering into any other transaction that addresses our ability to continue as a going concern.\nHowever, in view of the matters described in the preceding paragraphs, recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which, in turn, is dependent upon the Company\u2019s ability to generate positive cash flows from operations. The Company, however, operates in markets that are emerging and highly competitive. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional capital, operate at a profit or generate positive cash flows in the future. Therefore, management\u2019s plans do not alleviate the substantial doubt regarding the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was approximately $8,009,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $11,267,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss of $7,253,000 and an increase in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $438,000. Those amounts in addition to approximately $1,194,000 of non-cash income, including $2,252,000 in income from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities offset by $862,000 in stock-based compensation, $72,000 in depreciation and amortization and $124,000 from the application of rent deposits. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated cash of $690,000 from decreases in current assets offset by $20,000 from increases in our operating leases right-of-use assets and used cash of $410,000 through decreases in current liabilities and deferred revenue offset by increases of $178,000 in pension liability.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $11,267,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $10,310,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities consisted of net loss of $11,581,000 and an increase in working capital and other assets and liabilities of $287,000. Those amounts were offset by approximately $723,000 of non-cash costs and $696,000 in non-cash income. Non-cash costs were $652,000 in stock-based compensation and $71,000 in depreciation and amortization. Non-cash income consisted of $696,000 in the change in fair value of derivative liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we used cash of $209,000 from increases in current assets offset by $168,000 from decreases in our operating leases right-of-use assets and generated cash of $357,000 through increases in current liabilities and deferred revenue offset by $32,000 used from decreases in contract costs.\nInvesting Activities\nThere was no net cash used or generated from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we used cash of $31,000 to fund capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nCash generated from financing activities was approximately $15,475,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of cash of approximately $12,060,000 generated from the sale of 12,060 shares of Series D Preferred. Such amount includes $2,187,000 received by the Company in the form of a Bridge Loan which was converted into shares of Series D Preferred before recognition of approximately $726,000 in cash direct stock issuance costs. We also generated cash of approximately $900,000 from the issuance of related party notes payable and generated cash of $1,571,000 from the issuance of the PPP Loan under the CARES Act. Also in the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated cash of approximately $2,360,000 from the sales of 15,700,000 shares of Common Stock before recognition of approximately $64,000 in direct stock issuance costs. We used cash of approximately $575,000 to repay certain related party notes payable and used cash of approximately $51,000 for the payment of dividends on our Series B Preferred.\nCash generated from financing activities was approximately $6,635,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, which consisted of cash generated of approximately $166,000 from the exercise of 351,334 stock options resulting in the issuance of 351,334 shares of Common Stock, and cash generated of $6,520,000 from the sale of 5,954,545 shares of Common Stock, offset by cash used of approximately $51,000 for the payment of dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock.\nReal Property Leases\nOur corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, where we now occupy approximately 500 square feet of office space at a cost of approximately $2,000 per month. We entered into this facility\u2019s lease in February 2021 and this new lease commenced on March 1, 2021 and is on a month-to-month basis. In addition to our corporate headquarters, we also occupied the following spaces at December 31, 2020:\n\u25cf\n1,508 square feet in Ottawa, Province of Ontario, Canada, at a cost of approximately $3,000 per month until the expiration of the lease on March 31, 2021. The Company extended this lease for a 30-day period and is currently evaluating alternative premises which the Company believes are readily available;\n\u25cf\n9,720 square feet in Portland, Oregon, at a cost of approximately $23,000 per month until the expiration of the lease on February 28, 2023; and\n\u25cf\n183 square feet of office space in Mexico City, Mexico, at a cost of approximately $2,000 per month until September 30, 2021.\nPrior to entering into our current lease agreement in January 2021 and moving our corporate headquarters to a new location, we occupied 8,511 square feet of office space in San Diego, at a cost of approximately $30,000 per month. In January 2021, we entered in a subleasing agreement for our previously occupied corporate headquarters located in San Diego, California. The term of the sublease commences on April 1, 2021 and expires on April 20, 2025 coterminous with the expiration of the Company's master lease. Sublease payments due the Company approximate $26,000 per month over the term of the sublease.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation related to equity options and restricted stock has been classified as follows in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\nCost of revenue\n$15\n$13\nGeneral and administrative\nSales and marketing\nResearch and development\nTotal\n$862\n$643\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, special purpose or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we did not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As a result, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. We do not have relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d), or other standard setting bodies, which are adopted by us as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company\u2019s management believes the impact of recently issued standards not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements upon adoption. See Note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe primary inflationary factor affecting our operations is labor costs, and we do not believe that inflation has materially affected earnings during the past four years. Substantial increases in costs and expense, particularly labor and operating expense, could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers and end users.",
