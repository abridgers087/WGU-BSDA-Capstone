      "Following a review of its Bitcoin mining operations in early 2019, we determined to consolidate our activities in a Company-owned and managed facility. Central to this strategy was the purchase of land in LaFayette, GA and the entry into a favorable contract for electricity in the second quarter of 2019. Located adjacent to a utility substation, the several acre property has access to over 20 megawatts (MW) of low-cost power.\n",
      "The Company owned approximately 669 and 649 Antminer S17 Pro Bitcoin miners located in LaFayette, GA as of December 31, 2020 and April 15, 2021, respectively. All miners were purchased from Bitmaintech Pte. Ltd., a Singapore limited company (“Bitmain”), and are collectively rated at approximately 30 Ph/s in computing power. Bitmain has acknowledged manufacturing defects, combined with inadequate repair facilities, rendering approximately one half of our miners in need of repair or replacement. The Company’s miners are housed in three modified shipping containers. The Company’s current electrical load is estimated at under 1.0 MW. The entire facility, including the land, two 2500 KVA 3-phase transformers, the mining containers, and miners, are owned by MGT. As the Company is presently using only a portion of the built-out available electrical load, it is exploring ways to grow and maintain its current operations including but not limited to further equipment sales, leasing space to other Bitcoin miners, and raising capital to acquire newest generation miners.\n",
      "Prior to establishing our Company-owned and managed facility, we conducted our Bitcoin mining operations through third-party hosting arrangements. We also entered into management agreements with third party investors whereby the investors purchased the mining hardware, and we received both a fee to manage the mining operations plus one-half of the net operating profit. In March 2019, we en\n"
